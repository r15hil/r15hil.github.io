# Copilot

I am writing this page with GitHub Copilot, it does not really help much.

## What is copilot

Copilot suggested that title so I am going to use it.

## How to use copilot

I am not sure how to use it, I am just writing this page and it is doing the rest. I am not sure if it is going to be useful.

## How to install copilot

I am not sure how to install it, I am just writing this page and it is doing the rest. I am not sure if it is going to be useful.

## How to uninstall copilot

I am not sure how to uninstall it, I am just writing this page and it is doing the rest. I am not sure if it is going to be useful.

## I take back what I said

Copilot obviously suggested the above four sections, I am not sure if it is going to be useful.

This is **bold** and this is *italic* and this is `code`.

> This is a quote
> 
> And this is the second line of the quote
> 
> And this is the third line of the quote

This is a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
    - Item 2ai
- Item 3

## Conclusion

Copilot does help a little bit, but it is not really useful. I am not sure if it is going to be useful.

Ok no more copilot autosuggestions from now on.
It is pretty cool, it suggests the next sentence based on what you have written so far, although it is very repeptitive. It does however help with formatting but you have to prompt it to do what you want, like the examples of bold, italic and code above. It also helps with lists and quotes. It is not really useful for writing a whole page or even a few sentences but good for formatting.

Maybe if it had more context, like if all my pages were in the same folder, or I had more content on the site it would work better.

Disclaimer: I am not sure if it is going to be useful.
ps. I am not sure if it is going to be useful.
