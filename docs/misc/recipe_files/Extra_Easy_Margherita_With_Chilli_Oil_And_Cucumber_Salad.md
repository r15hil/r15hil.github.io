### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the grated garlic, dried oregano and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base

### Step 3

Cut your cucumber into batons

### Step 5

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your extra easy margherita

### Step 6

Whilst the pizza is cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat for 1-2 min or until very hot

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small heatproof bowl with a generous pinch of salt

Carefully pour the heated oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your chilli oil

### Step 7

Combine your salad and cucumber batons in a bowl with the balsamic dressing

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Set aside half of the cucumber batons for serving!</span>

Give everything a good mix up – this is your leafy cucumber salad

### Step 8

Serve the extra easy margherita and drizzle over the chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), then tear over your basil

Serve with the leafy cucumber salad to the side

Enjoy!
