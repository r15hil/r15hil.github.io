## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, deseed the pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough, bite-sized pieces

Wash your spring greens, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your shredded spring greens and chopped pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Once the veg is starting to soften, drain, then add your king prawns to the pan with the chopped ginger and chopped garlic and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your red chilli relish, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your stir-fry sauce


### Step 7

Once everything's fragrant, add the stir-fry sauce to the pan and cook for 2 min further, giving it a good mix up until everything is coated in the sauce and the prawns are cooked through – these are your ginger & chilli king prawns

### Step 8

Serve the ginger & chilli king prawns with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
