### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2-3 tbsp olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until the onion has softened

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> sugar and the cider vinegar and bring to the boil

### Step 5

Once cooked, drain and run the potatoes under cold water until cool enough to handle

Mash them until smooth

Add half of the chopped chives, 2-3 tbsp olive oil and season generously with both salt and pepper, then mix to combine

### Step 6

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> flour and mix to combine into a dough

Place the dough onto a floured surface and bring it together into a ball with your hands

Divide the ball into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> pieces and roll each into a golf ball shape

Pat each ball down and sprinkle with a little flour – these are your potato cakes

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2-3 tbsp olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the potato cakes and cook for 4 min on both sides or until browned

Transfer to kitchen paper and season with both salt and pepper

Reserve the pan for the next step

### Step 8

Return the reserved pan to a high heat, add the smoked streaky bacon and cook for 2-3 min each side, or until done to your liking

Stir the remaining chopped chives through the beans and you're ready to serve

Enjoy!
