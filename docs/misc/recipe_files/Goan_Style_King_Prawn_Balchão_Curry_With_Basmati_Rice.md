## Description

The word ‘balchão’ in this dish refers to the use of vinegar as a way of preserving fish and meat, and it's what gives this curry its fiery sour flavour. Serve as they would in Goa, over hot basmati rice. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, ground coriander, ground cumin, chilli flakes, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind to a smooth paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Use a food processor instead!

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the balchão spice paste and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once fragrant, increase the heat to medium-high, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with your tamarind paste, cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 2-3 min or until the prawns are almost cooked through
