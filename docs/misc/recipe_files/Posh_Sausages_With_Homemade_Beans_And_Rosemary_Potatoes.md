## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 20g rocket
- 8 Jolly Hog pigs in blankets
- 210g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 3 white potatoes
- 400g canned cannellini beans
- 5g rosemary
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Strip the rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems


### Step 2

Add the chopped potato to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle the rosemary leaves all over and give everything a good mix up – these are your rosemary roast potatoes


### Step 3

Add the pigs in blankets to the other side of the tray and put everything in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are crisp

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and drained cannelini beans and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add in the chicken stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>boiled water and stir to combine


### Step 7

Add the chopped tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper to the pot

Mix it all together, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – these are your homemade beans

### Step 8

Garnish with a handful of rocket drizzled in some olive oil and season everything with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
