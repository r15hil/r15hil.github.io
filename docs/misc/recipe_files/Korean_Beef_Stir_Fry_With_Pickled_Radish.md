## Ingredients

- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 250g British beef strips
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 15ml rice vinegar	
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 15ml soy sauce
- 15ml mirin 
- 1 apple
- 125g seasonal radishes
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the beef strips to a small bowl with the soy sauce and set aside to marinate


### Step 2

Top, tail and slice the radishes (as finely as you can)

Add the sliced radishes to a bowl with the rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside â€“ these are your pickled radishes


### Step 3

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 120ml<span class="text-danger"> [170ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over the highest heat

Once your pan is very hot, add the beef strips and cook for 1 min exactly, to sear the outside, but prevent them from overcooking

Tip: You'll finish cooking these in the sauce later

Once done, transfer the beef strips to a plate to rest


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil (there should be some juices leftover from the beef strips), add the sliced shallot, garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Meanwhile, grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on)

Once softened, add the grated apple then the mirin and cook for 2-3 min or until the apple starts to break down


### Step 7

Add the stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened a little

Stir through the rested beef strips and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the Korean beef stir-fry with the cooked rice to the side and the pickled radishes in a small bowl

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the top of the stir-fry

Enjoy!
