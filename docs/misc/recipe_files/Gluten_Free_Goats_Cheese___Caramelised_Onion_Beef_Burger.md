### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems then chop them as finely as possible, discard the stems

### Step 2

Sprinkle the chopped rosemary over the fries with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and mix it all together

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp, golden and cooked through – these are your rosemary fries

### Step 3

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s] and set aside for later

Finely slice the remaining onion

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with half of your balsamic vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and a generous pinch of sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook the onion until they have softened and caramelised

### Step 5

While the onion is cooking, combine your beef mince with the diced onion and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince and shape into 1 patty per person

### Step 6

Once the chips have been in for 15-20 min, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef patty[ies] and press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Meanwhile, slice your gluten free brioche buns in half and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1681825812184-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once browned, flip the beef patty[ies] and crumble your goats' cheese over them

Cover and reduce the heat to medium-high then cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy patty[ies]

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread a little butter on your warmed brioche bun base, then top with a cheesy patty, some caramelised onion, a handful of salad and finally the warmed brioche bun lid

Serve the rosemary fries and remaining salad to the side

Dress the salad with the remaining balsamic vinegar and a splash of olive oil

Enjoy!
