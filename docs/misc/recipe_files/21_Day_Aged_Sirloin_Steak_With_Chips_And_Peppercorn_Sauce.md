## Ingredients

- British sirloin steak (400g)
- British sirloin steak (200g) x0
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Cracked black pepper (2.5g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Shallot
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips


### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and add the tray[s] to the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Whilst the chips are cooking, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim your green beans

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped garlic and green beans and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic is fragrant

Season with a pinch of salt and add a splash of boiled water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the beans are tender

Once done, keep covered and set aside for later – these are your garlicky beans


### Step 5

Pat your sirloin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then rub with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt

Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, once very hot, add the seasoned steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side


### Step 6

Once the steak is cooked, transfer it to a plate to rest and return the pan to a low heat

Add the diced shallot and cook for 1-2 min or until softened


### Step 7

Add your soy sauce and crème fraîche and cook for 2-3 min, stirring frequently

Tip: Scrape any bits from the bottom of the pan as this will add extra flavour to the sauce!

Add your cracked black pepper and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your peppercorn sauce

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Pour any steak resting juice into the peppercorn sauce

Serve the sirloin steak over the peppercorn sauce with the chips and garlicky beans to the side

Enjoy!
