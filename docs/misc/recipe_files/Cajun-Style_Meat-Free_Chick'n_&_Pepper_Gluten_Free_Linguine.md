### Step 1

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic, pepper strips and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Once the vegetables have softened, add the smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano and ground cumin to the pan

Season with a pinch of sugar and salt, add a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Reboil half a kettle

Once fragrant, add the meat-free chick'n to the pan with the vegetables and cook for 4-6 min further or until warmed through and starting to brown

### Step 6

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 7

Once the meat-free chick'n is starting to brown, add the tomato stock and cook for a final 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Add the drained linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style meat-free chick'n & pepper gluten free linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the Cajun-style meat-free chick'n & pepper gluten free linguine and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
