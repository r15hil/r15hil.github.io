## Ingredients

- Rice noodles (150g)
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Coconut flakes (20g)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Ground turmeric (0.5tsp)
- Tamari soy sauce (15ml)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set aside and reserve the pan – this is your toasted coconut

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 2

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water and set aside

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, tamari soy sauce and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Heat the reserved pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Once starting to soften, add your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa and halved green beans to the pan

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through and the green beans are tender

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the fish is cooked through, add the drained rice noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy curried basa coconut noodles

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the spicy curried basa coconut noodles in bowls and garnish with the toasted coconut

Enjoy!
