### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely (chop them in one bunch for speed!)

### Step 3

Add your mangetout to a large bowl and cover them in boiled water until fully submerged

Set aside to soften

In a small bowl combine your soy sauce, honey and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your teriyaki sauce

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your hake fillet[s] to the pan and cook for an initial 1-2 min on each side

### Step 5

While the hake is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 6

Add the teriyaki sauce and half the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min on each side further or until the hake is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your teriyaki hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, drain the mangetout and return to the bowl

Add your toasted sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame greens

### Step 8

Serve the teriyaki hake with the cooked rice and sesame greens on the side

Garnish with the remaining spring onion

Enjoy!
