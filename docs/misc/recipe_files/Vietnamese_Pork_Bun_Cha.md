### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7, and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Add the pork mince to a bowl with the honey, ginger, half the garlic and a generous pinch of salt

Set aside the remaining garlic for your dipping sauce later

### Step 2

Mix the pork mixture thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 10<span class="text-danger"> [20]</span> meatballs (they don't have to look perfect!)

Add the meatballs to a baking tray greased with vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your honey-pork meatballs

### Step 3

Whilst the honey-pork meatballs are in the oven, add the Thai rice noodles to a heatproof bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside

### Step 4

Whilst the noodles are softening, top, tail and peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons to a bowl with the rice vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle

### Step 5

Chop the little gem lettuce roughly

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/RC1929RC1551v2Step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Squeeze the juice of half the lime into a small bowl and add the fish sauce, toasted sesame oil and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add the remaining garlic, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar, a splash of water and a pinch of salt

Stir it all together – this is your chilli-lime dressing

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/RC1929RC1551v2Step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add half of the chilli-lime dressing to the drained noodles and give everything a good mix up

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the honey-pork meatballs, carrot ribbons, and chopped little gem lettuce over the noodles

Garnish with the mint, remaining chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), fried onions and lime wedges

Add the leftover pickling juice to the remaining dressing and serve as a dipping sauce to the side, or drizzle all over and enjoy!
