### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 3

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground allspice to the pan and cook for 2 min

Add your soy sauce and a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered, for a further 10-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Combine your mayo with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> pineapple juice (save the slices for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pineapple mayo

Tip: Keep the remaining pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Separate 2 leaves per person from the lettuce

Chop the inner core[s] into quarters lengthways

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Once the chips are almost ready, drain your pineapple slices and add them to a separate baking tray

Top the pineapple slices with the grated cheddar cheese

Add your ciabatta[s] to the tray and put in the oven for 5 min or until the cheese is melted

### Step 7

Meanwhile, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once pulled, mix the pulled chicken in with the pan juices – this is your shredded fiery chicken

### Step 8

Cut the warmed ciabatta in half

Assemble the ciabatta with a lettuce leaf, a cheesy pineapple slice, the shredded fiery chicken, another lettuce leaf, another cheesy pineapple slice and finally with a dollop of pineapple mayo– this is your fiery chicken thigh & cheesy pineapple ciabatta

Serve with the chips and lettuce wedges on the side

Enjoy!
