### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Remove 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter from the fridge to soften

![Step 2 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-2-1641303436522-x200.jpg)

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel your potato[es] and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped potato, sliced carrot and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with your cherry tomatoes and ground smoked paprika

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1 min or until the garlic has softened

### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water with the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 20-25 min or until the potato is tender and the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your caldeirada-style stew

### Step 5

Meanwhile, separate your parsley & chives, then chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your chives finely

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter), then cut the lemon[s] into quarters

Slice your bread roll[s] in half and score the cut sides in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way through

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1641303454411-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Combine the lemon zest, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and remaining chopped garlic with the softened butter  – this is your peri-peri butter

Spread the peri-peri butter over the scored bread roll halves and add it to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Once the stew is almost ready, put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until warmed through and crusty – this is your peri-peri crusty bread

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1641303457807-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the caldeirada-style stew is ready, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and cook, covered, for a final 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once the haddock is cooked, add the juice of half your lemon[s], the chopped chives and remaining chopped parsley and mix everything together – this is your caldeirada-style haddock stew

### Step 8

Cut the peri-peri crusty bread into triangles

Serve the caldeirada-style haddock stew with the peri-peri crusty bread to the side, ready for dipping

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!
