## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the potato pieces to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, add your chicken breast portions to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken breast portions with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and pat them dry with kitchen paper – these are your chicken escalopes


### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese into a bowl, add your panko breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy breadcrumb mix


### Step 4

Add the chicken escalopes to the the bowl of cheesy breadcrumb mix and press them into the mix until nicely coated

Add the coated chicken to the other side of the baking tray with the potatoes

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once everything is in the oven, boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Peel and chop your red onions roughly and chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [75ml]</span> [100ml]</span> boiled water

While the chicken is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


### Step 6

Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened

Add the vegetable stock and cook for 1-2 min further

Season generously with salt and pepper – this is your mixed veg


### Step 7

Once done, tear your basil into the pan

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy baked chicken over the mixed veg with the roast potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
