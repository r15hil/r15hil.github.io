## Description

Pesto is our go-to sauce for fresh fast food. It takes mere minutes to make, and transforms pasta in an instant. This pesto is made from rocket, which has an earthy bitterness that's offset by the sweetness of walnuts and saltiness of garlic and cheese.

Boil a full kettle

Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling salted water for 8-10 min or until the pasta is cooked, stirring occasionally, then drain and set aside for step 7 (reserve 1 cup of pasta water)

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a dry wide based pan (large enough to fit the cooked pasta in) on a medium low heat

When hot, add the walnuts and toast for 3-5 min, moving them about the pan occasionally so they colour evenly

Once toasted, remove them from the heat and reserve the pan for step 7

Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of the cooking water
