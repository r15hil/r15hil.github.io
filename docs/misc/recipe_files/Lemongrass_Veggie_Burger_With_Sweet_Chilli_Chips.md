## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Ciabatta x2
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- White potato x3
- Carrot
- Coriander (10g)
- Fresh lemongrass stalk
- Mint (10g)
- Coriander (5g) x0
- Mint (5g) x0
- Shallot

- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layer[s] and discard, then chop your softer inner core[s] in half

Peel your garlic and shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chop in half and strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Add the halved garlic and shallot, lemongrass, half the mint leaves and half your coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped – this is your lemongrass paste


### Step 3

Once blitzed, combine the lemongrass paste with your vegan burger patty[ies] in a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemongrass burger mix


### Step 4

Divide the lemongrass burger mix and shape into 1 patty per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the patty[ies] to the pan and cook for 5 min on each side or until browned, crisp and cooked through – these are your lemongrass patty[ies]


### Step 5

While the patty[ies] cooks, peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons to a bowl with your rice vinegar and give everything a good mix up and set aside – these are your quick-pickled carrot ribbons

Trim, then slice your spring onions


### Step 6

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the halved ciabatta[s] to a baking tray (cut side up) and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until  hot and crusty

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 7

In a small bowl combine your red chilli relish and mayo – this is your sweet chilli mayo

### Step 8

Top the base of the toasted ciabatta with some sweet chilli mayo, the remaining coriander and mint, a lemongrass patty and the quick-pickled carrot ribbons, then top with the ciabatta lid – this is your lemongrass veggie burger 

Serve with the chips to the side and drizzle over the remaining sweet chilli mayo, then top with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
