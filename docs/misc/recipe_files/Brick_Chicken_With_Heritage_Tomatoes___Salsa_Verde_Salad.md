## Ingredients

- British skin-on chicken thighs (160g) x0
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Heritage tomatoes (160g)
- British skin-on chicken thighs (320g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Capers (20g)
- Parsley (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes into quarters

Add your chopped potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 8-10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cover with a piece of tin foil, then a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 12 min, checking occasionally, until the chicken skin is golden and crispy


### Step 3

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Chop your heritage tomatoes in half

Once the potatoes are tender, remove the cling film and add a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Give the seasoned potatoes a good mix up, then set aside to cool down


### Step 4

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Chop your capers roughly

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Add the chopped parsley, capers, garlic and a pinch of salt and sugar to a pestle & mortar and grind to form a paste

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil with the juice of half your lemon[s] and mix it all together – this is your salsa verde

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!


### Step 6

Once the chicken has had 12 min, remove the smaller pan and discard the tin foil

Turn the chicken thighs over and cook for a final 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your brick chicken


### Step 7

Combine half the salsa verde (you'll use the rest later!) with the cooled potatoes, chopped lettuce and heritage tomatoes – this is your heritage tomato & salsa verde salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the heritage tomato & salsa verde salad topped with the brick chicken

Drizzle over the remaining salsa verde and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
