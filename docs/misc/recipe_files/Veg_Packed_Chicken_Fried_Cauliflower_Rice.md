### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Remove the leaves from your cauliflower, then chop into rough bite-sized pieces

Add the cauliflower to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped – this is your cauliflower rice


### Step 2

Cover your blanched peas with boiled water and set aside until later

Grate your carrot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Chop your chicken breast strips into small bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over


### Step 4

Drain your peas, then add them to the pan with the grated carrot, chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Add the cauliflower rice and cook for 1-2 min, stirring it all together


### Step 6

Add your soy sauce and sesame oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your veg-packed chicken fried cauliflower rice


### Step 7

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

### Step 8

Serve the chicken fried cauliflower rice

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
