## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 16g tomato paste
- 120g spinach
- 50g basmati rice
- 32g tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 100g basmati rice
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 star anise
- 3 cardamom pods
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 10g coriander
- 80g spinach
- 5g coriander
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it until it's wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool enough to handle

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly

Reboil a kettle


### Step 3

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the sliced garlic, ground fenugreek, garam masala and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the softened onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the chopped sweet potato to the pan and cook for 3 min further or until starting to brown


### Step 4

While the sweet potato is browning, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the sweet potato has browned, add the tomato stock and chopped spinach to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender – this is your fragrant sweet potato saag masala


### Step 5

While the sauce thickens, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Melt a knob of butter alternative in a pot with a matching lid over a medium heat

Once melted, add the crushed cardamom pods and star anise to the pot and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Add the basmati rice to the pot and cook for 1 min further, then add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your pilau rice


### Step 7

While the pilau rice is cooking, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Stir the chopped coriander through the pilau rice, discard the star anise and cardamom pods

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant sweet potato saag masala with the pilau rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
