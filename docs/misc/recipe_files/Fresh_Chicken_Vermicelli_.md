## Ingredients

- 1 bag of roasted peanuts
- 1 red chilli
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil 
- 100g carrots
- 4 British chicken thigh fillets 
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 20g fresh coriander
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 spring onion
- 1 knob of fresh root ginger (15g)
- 1 soy sauce sachet (8ml)
- 1 lime 
- 120g rice vermicelli 

## Instructions

### Step 1

Submerge the noodles in cold water in a wide pot


Soak in the water for 5-8 min (off of the heat), or until loosened and softened


Set the pot over a medium heat for 5-8, until warmed and tender


Drain and rinse completely and set aside for step 7

### Step 2

Zest and juice the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> straight into a processor (reserve the lime skins for step 4)


Peel and roughly chop the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon)


Chop the chilli&nbsp;roughly, discarding the stalk


Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 3

Place the chicken thighs in a pan (with a lid), cover with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiling water


Add the reserved lime skins from step 2


Add a big pinch of salt, and a lid


Cook on a low-medium heat for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through and tender

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the ginger, chilli, fish sauce, honey, coriander, peanuts, sesame oil <br />and soy sauce to the processor


Blitz to a rough paste- this is your fresh chutney

### Step 5

Peel and top and tail the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Continue to peel lengths off of the carrot, until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Peel as far as you can, then grate the inner stem


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely&nbsp;

### Step 6

Combine the cooked noodles in a large bowl with the carrot, spring onion and half the coriander chutney


Mix well (use your hands here!)

### Step 7

Remove the lid from the chicken pan


Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board, leaving the liquid behind


Slice the chicken thinly (with a knife and fork)


Return the chicken juice pan to a medium high heat and reduce by half 


Add the chicken back to the pan, and stir in the remaining chutney

### Step 8

Add the sliced chicken and coriander juices to the noodles and mix well


Plate the noodles and chicken into bowls


Enjoy!
