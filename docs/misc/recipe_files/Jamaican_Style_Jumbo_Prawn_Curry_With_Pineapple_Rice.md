### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain then add your jumbo prawns and chopped pepper to the pan with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground turmeric, curry powder, your ground allspice and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper has slightly softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, drain your pineapple and chop into bite-sized pieces

Tip: Keep the pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Once the pepper has slightly softened, add your chopped creamed coconut, roasted garlic paste, tomato paste and 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[250ml] </span>boiled water to the pan

Stir it all together and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce is starting to thicken and the jumbo prawns are cooked through

### Step 6

Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Once the prawns are cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and stir through a large knob of<span class="text-danger"> </span>butter and a pinch of salt – this is your Jamaican-style jumbo prawn curry

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to a large bowl with the chopped pineapple, sliced spring onion and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your pineapple rice

### Step 8

Serve the pineapple rice topped with the Jamaican-style jumbo prawn curry

Tear your coriander all over

Enjoy!
