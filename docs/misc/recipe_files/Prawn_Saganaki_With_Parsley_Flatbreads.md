Transport yourself to Greece with this classic. King prawns, garlic, tomatoes and chilli are topped with sumac roasted feta cheese. Traditionally served with chunks of bread, you'll create garlic and parsley flatbreads, using tortillas, which we think are perfect for scooping.

Once hot, add the diced&nbsp;onion and cook for 4 min or until it's softened slightly&nbsp;
