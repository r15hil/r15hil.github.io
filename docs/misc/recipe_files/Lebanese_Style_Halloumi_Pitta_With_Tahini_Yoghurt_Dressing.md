### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Cut your halloumi into strips

Add the halloumi strips to a bowl with your baharat and give everything a good mix up until the halloumi is fully coated

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden brown

### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the tomato wedges, mooli slaw mix and salad in a large bowl

Add your cider vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a drizzle of olive oil and toss – this is your salad

Slice the warmed pitta[s] along the top and open up to form a pocket (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

### Step 8

Fill each pitta with a handful of the salad, halloumi and tahini yoghurt dressing – this is your Lebanese-style halloumi pitta

Serve the Lebanese-style halloumi pitta with the remaining salad to the side

Enjoy!
