## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Boil a full kettle


Add the conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 4 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small florets 


After 4 min, add the cauliflower florets to the pasta and cook for a further 6-7 min or until everything is cooked with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain, reserving 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>starchy cooking water and leave to steam dry in the sieve 


Reserve the pot


### Step 3

While the pasta cooks, grate the cheddar cheese


Combine the grated cheese with the panko breadcrumbs – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the starchy pasta water and whisk until smooth


Once smooth, remove the pot from the heat and add the crème fraîche, Dijon mustard and a grind of pepper – this is your sauce


### Step 5

Add the drained pasta and cauliflower to the sauce and stir it all together – this is your creamy cauliflower pasta


### Step 6

Transfer the creamy cauliflower pasta to an oven-proof dish 


Top with the cheesy breadcrumbs 


Sprinkle over the bacon lardons and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the bacon is cooked and the breadcrumbs are golden

Use the rest of this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Garnish with the chopped chives 


Enjoy!
