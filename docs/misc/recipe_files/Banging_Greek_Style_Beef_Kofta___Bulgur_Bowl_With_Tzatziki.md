## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Mediterranean style seasoning (3g)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Tomato
- Mint sauce (20g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Roasted garlic paste (15g)
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Bulgur wheat (130g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your minced beef to a large bowl with your panko breadcrumbs

Add half your Mediterranean seasoning and half your roasted garlic paste (you’ll use the rest later!) with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)


### Step 2

Divide and shape into koftas (3 per person!) – these are your beef koftas


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the beef koftas and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high, cover with a lid and cook for a further 6-7 min, turning occasionally, then remove the lid and cook for 2-3 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Greek-style beef koftas

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to use 2 pans


### Step 4

Whilst the koftas are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your cucumber[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Wash your lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred


### Step 6

Combine your yoghurt with half the chopped cucumber, your mint sauce and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chunky tzatziki


### Step 7

Add your chicken stock mix to the cooked bulgur with the remaining roasted garlic paste and Mediterranean seasoning

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your garlicky bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style beef koftas over the garlicky bulgur with the lettuce, tomato wedges and remaining chopped cucumber to the side

Top the salad with your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Serve with a dollop of chunky tzatziki to the side

Enjoy!
