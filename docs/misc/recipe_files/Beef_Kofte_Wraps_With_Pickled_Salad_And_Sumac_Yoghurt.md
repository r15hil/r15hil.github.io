Peel and finely dice the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Add your cider vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>boiled water and a pinch of salt to a bowl and stir it all together

Add the grated carrot to the bowl and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled carrot

### Step 3

Add the diced onion to a separate bowl with half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!), beef stock mix, ground cumin and ground turmeric

Add your beef mince, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your kofte mix

![Step 4 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2175.-step-4-x200.jpg)

### Step 4

Divide the kofte mix into 6<span class="text-danger"> </span>balls per person, then shape the balls into rough oval shapes – these are your beef kofte

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef kofte and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until lightly browned

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2175.-step-5-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the sliced red onion with a splash of boiled water to the pan and cook, covered, for an initial 6-7 min or until browned

After the initial 6-7 min, remove the lid and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the liquid in the pan has evaporated and the koftes are cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

While the kofte are cooking, add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with your ground sumac, remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt

Stir it all together – this is your sumac yoghurt

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Slice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely into rounds, then cut in half

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2175.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Drain the quick-pickled carrot and return it to the bowl with the shredded lettuce and toss – this is your quick-pickled salad

### Step 8

Spread your warmed tortilla wraps with some of the sumac yoghurt, then add the quick-pickled salad, halved tomato rounds and 2 beef kofte

Top with the cooked onion, any remaining sumac yoghurt and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
