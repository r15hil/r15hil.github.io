## Ingredients

- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Basa fillet x0
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Lime
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Peel and grate your garlic


### Step 2

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the grated garlic, dried oregano and half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the fries are well coated

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until lightly golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Combine your mayo with the lime zest, a small squeeze of lime juice (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) and a pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your lime mayo


### Step 4

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with the remaining lime juice, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli-lime slaw


### Step 5

Add your cornflour to a plate with the remaining ground smoked paprika and a very generous pinch of salt and mix until fully combined

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Place the basa fillet[s] onto the floured plate, pressing firmly to coat evenly on both sides – this is your coated basa


### Step 6

When the fries are almost ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your Baja-style basa fillet

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the fries are lightly golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven, push the fries to one side and add the brioche halves to the other side, cut-side down

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the brioche is warmed through and the fries are golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries

### Step 8

Build your burger by topping a warmed brioche base with a Baja-style basa fillet, a drizzle of lime mayo, some of the chilli-lime slaw and a warmed brioche lid – this is your Baja-style basa burger

Serve the smoky fries and remaining chilli-lime slaw to the side

Enjoy!
