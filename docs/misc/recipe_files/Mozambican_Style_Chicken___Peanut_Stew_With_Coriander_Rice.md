## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken thighs to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour and a pinch of salt and pepper and toss them to coat them evenly


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick and with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your coated chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan with any remaining oil


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts


### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chopped creamed coconut, chicken stock mix, tomato paste and peanut butter in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water – this is your peanut stock


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic and tomato wedges with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander and a large pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for, 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 7

Once softened, add the peanut stock and the browned chicken to the pan

Cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Mozambican-style chicken & peanut stew

Add most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) and most of the chopped peanuts (save some for garnish!) to the cooked rice and stir it all together – this is your coriander rice

### Step 8

Serve the Mozambican-style chicken & peanut stew with the coriander rice

Garnish with the reserved chopped coriander & chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
