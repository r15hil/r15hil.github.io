## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Cut your broccoli into small florets

Cut the broccoli stem[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Peel and cut your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the broccoli florets, carrot batons, broccoli stems, onion petals and a very generous pinch of salt and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until the veg is starting to soften


### Step 4

While the veg is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic and cornflour in a bowl with your soy sauce, hoisin sauce and 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your hoisin mixture


### Step 5

Once the veg is starting to soften, add the hoisin mixture to the pan and cook, covered, for 7-8 min until the veg is tender


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water and set aside


### Step 7

Once the veg is tender, add the drained noodles to the pan with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your hoisin broccoli noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin broccoli noodle stir-fry

Enjoy!
