### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the egg from cracking) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 5 min, then fill a bowl of very cold water (use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!) and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl to cool down quickly

### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a  drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and set the tray[s] aside until later

### Step 3

Add a sheet of baking paper to your chopping board and sprinkle over a very generous dusting of flour

Combine your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to form 1 giant meatball per person, then flatten the giant meatball[s] into a circle (big enough to coat an egg) onto the floured baking paper until you have 1 sausage meat circle per person

### Step 4

Put the baking tray[s] with the chips in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

While the chips are in the oven, peel the cooled egg[s]

Add a peeled egg to the centre of each sausage meat circle

Wrap the sausage meat around each egg and seal it tightly on all sides so that there aren't any gaps – this is your sausage-coated egg

### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs and curry powder to a plate and give it a good mix up – these are your spiced breadcrumbs

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a separate plate

Turn the sausage-coated egg[s] in the olive oil, shake off the excess, then add to the spiced breadcrumbs and press firmly until evenly coated all over – this is your breaded egg

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1646735813394-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the breaded egg[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 22-25 min, or until the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced black pudding scotch egg

Meanwhile, combine your ketchup and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your spicy ketchup

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1646735823207-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the tomato wedges, cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato salad

### Step 8

Slice the spiced black pudding scotch egg in half and serve with the chips, tomato salad and the spicy ketchup to the side

Enjoy!
