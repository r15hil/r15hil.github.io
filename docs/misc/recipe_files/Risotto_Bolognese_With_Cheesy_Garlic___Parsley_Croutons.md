## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, chopped carrot and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the onion and carrot are softening, dissolve your beef stock mix and soy sauce in 400ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> [700ml]</span> boiled water - this is your beef stock


### Step 4

Once softened, add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, breaking up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once the mince has broken up, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min further or until toasted and fully coated in the oil


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomatoes, dried oregano and beef stock and cook for 25-30 min, stirring frequently, until all of the stock has been absorbed, the rice is cooked and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your risotto bolognese


### Step 6

Whilst the risotto is cooking, cut your ciabatta[s] into small cubes

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the ciabatta cubes to a baking tray with the remaining chopped garlic, most of the chopped parsley and most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the croutons are toasted


### Step 7

Whilst the croutons are in the oven, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl with a generous grind of black pepper

Add the salad and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Serve the risotto bolognese topped with the garlic & parsley croutons and the salad to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
