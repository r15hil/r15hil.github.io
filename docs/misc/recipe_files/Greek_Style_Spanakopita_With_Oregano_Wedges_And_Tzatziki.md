## Ingredients

- Puff pastry (160g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Spring onion
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Spinach (120g)
- Mint & dill (10g)
- Spinach (80g) x0
- Brown onion
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s], then wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and spinach and cook for 3-4 min or until the spinach is wilted and the onion has softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Peel and finely grate your garlic


### Step 3

Crumble your Greek cheese into a bowl

Add the softened onion and wilted spinach to the bowl with the sliced spring onion, soft cheese and half of the chopped mint and dill (save the rest for later!)

Season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your spanakopita filling


### Step 4

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with your dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your oregano wedges


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out into a rectangle shape (or two!), approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to a baking tray (or two!) lined with non-stick baking paper, then add the spanakopita filling to the centre of the pastry in a sausage shape leaving a 2cm border at each end


### Step 6

Cut even strips into the pastry sides, roughly 3cm wide

Tuck the top and bottom ends of the pastry over the filling, then fold the strips over the filling in a criss-cross pattern until the mixture is completely covered – this is your spanakopita


### Step 7

Brush the spanakopita with a little milk and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through – this is your Greek-style spanakopita

Meanwhile, combine your natural yoghurt with the grated cucumber, grated garlic, the remaining chopped mint and dill and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby tzatziki

### Step 8

Slice the Greek-style spanakopita in half and serve with the oregano wedges and the herby tzatziki to the side

Enjoy!
