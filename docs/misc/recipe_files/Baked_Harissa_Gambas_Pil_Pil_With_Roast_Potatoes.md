## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Cut your lemon[s] into 2 wedges per person

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 5

Add the onion wedges, the juice of half<span class="text-danger"> </span>your lemon wedges, sliced garlic, ground smoked paprika, cherry tomatoes, harissa paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to an oven-proof dish

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After an initial 15 min, drain and add your king prawns to the oven-proof dish, give everything a good mix up and return to the oven for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your baked harissa gambas pil pil

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the baked harissa gambas pil pil with the roast potatoes and salad to the side

Garnish with a remaining lemon wedge and chop your parsley roughly over with scissors

Dig in!
