## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then add your basmati rice, cloves, a pinch of salt and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your fragrant rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Add your wholegrain mustard, cumin seeds, yellow mustard seeds, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind to form a smooth paste

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and mix well – this is your mustard mixture

Tip: Alternatively blitz together in a food processor!


### Step 4

Place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

Leave for 1 min, then remove from the mug

Add your ground turmeric and softened creamed coconut to the mustard mixture and give everything a good mix up – this is your Bengali-style mustard paste


### Step 5

Cut 1 piece of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper per person

Lay each hake fillet in the middle of a piece of paper and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Spoon your Bengali-style mustard paste evenly over the hake

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the hake to form a sealed parcel[s]


### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Bengali-style mustard hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad, grated carrot and chopped coriander to a bowl with the juice of half your lime[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your carrot & coriander salad

Discard the clove[s] from the fragrant rice and cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Bengali-style mustard hake alongside the fragrant rice with the carrot & coriander salad to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
