### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and add a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min, stirring occasionally until golden and caramelised

### Step 2

While the mushrooms are cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a large cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 3

Re-boil a full kettle

Once the mushrooms are golden, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[425ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 5

Once the pork is browned, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to the consistency of a ragù and the pork mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

While the ragù thickens, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Once the ragù has thickened, add your soft cheese

Add the drained tortiglioni to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water and season with salt and pepper

Stir it together until the sauce coats the pasta – this is your creamy pork & mushroom tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy pork & mushroom tortiglioni topped with the grated cheese and chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
