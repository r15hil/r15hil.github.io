### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Sprinkle your ground cumin over your meat-free patty[ies] and pat it into both sides until evenly coated

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add the coated meat-free patty[ies]  to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Add your chopped coriander to a bowl and crumble in your goats' cheese

Chop your sultanas roughly

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add both to a separate bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy carrot & sultana slaw

### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the ciabatta halves, cut side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 7

Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mayo and chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>water – this is your harissa mayo

### Step 8

Spread a spoonful of harissa mayo onto the warmed ciabatta halves, then top with a meat-free burger patty and the herby goats' cheese – this is your Persian-style veggie burger

Serve with the chips, zingy carrot & sultana slaw and any remaining harissa mayo to the side

Enjoy!
