## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 20g rocket
- 2 butter brioche buns
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 white wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 8 tbsp cornflour
- 1 shallot
- 15g capers

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skin on) into wedges

Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the basa fillets in half widthways

Add the cornflour to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Coat the fish in cornflour, pressing firmly to coat them evenly and set aside


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the butter brioche buns, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until coloured and charred on one side only

Once charred, remove and set aside until serving and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Chop the capers roughly

Combine the chopped capers, sliced shallot,<span class="text-danger"> </span>mayonnaise, white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your homemade tatare sauce


### Step 5

Slice the cheddar cheese in quarters lengthways


### Step 6

Once the wedges are nearly cooked, return the reserved pan to a high heat with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once very hot, add the coated fish and cook for 3-4 min each side or until golden


### Step 7

Transfer the crispy fish to a baking tray, season it with a pinch of salt and add the sliced cheese to 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> pieces

Put the tray in the oven for 4 min or until the cheese has just melted

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To assemble your fish burger, spread a little homemade tatare sauce over each brioche base and top with the crispy fish (cheesy one first!) and brioche lid

Serve the rocket salad, wedges and remaining homemade tatare sauce to the side

Enjoy!
