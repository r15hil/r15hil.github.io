## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 400g Swiss cheese fondue
- 40g Napoli & peppered salami mix
- 24g Serrano ham
- 1 Dijon mustard pot (5.5g)
- 50g cornichons
- 1 carrot
- 4 ciabatta rolls
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Chop the root<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger"> </span>and tear the leaves into rough, bite-sized pieces and give them a wash

Combine the red wine vinegar with the Dijon mustard and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your vinaigrette


### Step 3

Add the torn little gem to a serving bowl and top with the sliced shallot and grated carrot – this is your Alpine salad

Set aside for serving


### Step 4

Add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until hot and crusty

Once done, carefully cut the ciabatta rolls into bite-sized cubes


### Step 5

For fancy presentation, cut the peppered salami in half and roll each half into cone-shapes

Tip: Too fiddly? Just break both up into smaller pieces!

Add the the Serrano ham, Napoli salami and salami cones to a serving board or plate – this is your charcuterie

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic


### Step 6

Heat a pot over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Cut the cheese fondue packet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> open and squeeze into the pot (as much as you can!)

Cook for 6-8 min, stirring continuously until melted and silky

Tip: Although it melts quickly, letting it bubble for longer cooks off any excess alcohol!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the cornichons to a small serving bowl

Once everything's ready to serve, dress the Alpine salad with the vinaigrette

Season the melted cheese with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cheese fondue

### Step 8

Serve the cheese fondue, ciabatta cubes, charcuterie, cornichons and Alpine salad in the centre of the table, ready to share

Let everyone dig in

Tip: You may need to reheat the cheese every so often to keep it super melty

Enjoy!
