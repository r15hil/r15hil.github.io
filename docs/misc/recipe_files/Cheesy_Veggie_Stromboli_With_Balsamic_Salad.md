## Ingredients

- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Dried basil (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Pizza base mix (250g)
- Dried yeast (7g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Spinach (80g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and garlic

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, then add the sliced garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, dried basil, a pinch of sugar and your vegetable stock mix, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 3

Whilst the tomato sauce is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Whilst the onion is cooking, add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further, then add your spinach and cook for a final 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your stromboli filling

Meanwhile, add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 60ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Roll out the dough to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin (no need to knead!)

Add the rolled dough to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two), then spread half the tomato sauce (save the rest for later!) and the stromboli filling all over the dough and top with the torn mozzarella


### Step 6

Roll the dough over the filling, and continue to roll until you end up with a log shape, seal-side down

Brush with a little milk and sprinkle over your dried oregano – this is your cheesy veggie stromboli

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 22-25 min or until golden and cooked through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic salad

Return the remaining tomato sauce to a medium-low heat with a splash of cold water and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Once the stromboli is golden and cooked through, slice into 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>pieces per person

Serve the cheesy veggie stromboli slices with the balsamic salad and remaining tomato sauce to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
