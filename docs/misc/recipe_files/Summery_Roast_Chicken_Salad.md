### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add the chicken breast portion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min

### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half and tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Add the halved tomatoes and torn ciabatta to a bowl with your dried basil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash the halved tomatoes together with the torn ciabatta so that the juice soaks into the bread – these are your tomato croutons

### Step 4

Once the chicken has been in the oven for 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and surround it with tomato croutons

Return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear

### Step 5

Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a kettle

Combine your Dijon mustard with your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl

Mix everything together – this is your tangy mustard dressing

### Step 6

Trim your green beans, then add them to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover them with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once done, drain, then set aside for serving

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it roughly apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the salad, pulled roast chicken and tomato croutons on plates and top with the green beans

Drizzle over the tangy mustard dressing and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
