## Ingredients

- Bulgur wheat (75g)
- Lemon
- Courgette
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Seasonal salad (50g)
- Skin on salmon fillets (2pcs)
- Flaked almonds (15g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Mint (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for an initial 4 min


### Step 2

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once golden, transfer to a plate


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down

Cook for 9-10 min turning once halfway until golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Once the bulgur wheat has had an initial 4 min, add your blanched peas to the pot and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the bulgur wheat is cooked and tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain everything and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel your courgette[s] into ribbons

Crumble your Greek cheese into rough bite-sized pieces

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 6

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] to a bowl with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your lemon dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Add the courgette ribbons, salad, crumbled Greek cheese, most of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!) and lemon dressing to the cooked bulgur wheat

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your courgette ribbon & Greek cheese salad

### Step 8

Serve the courgette ribbon & Greek cheese salad with the salmon to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, remaining chopped mint and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
