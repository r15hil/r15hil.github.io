### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are crisp

### Step 2

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into 5 <span class="text-danger">[10]</span> strips then cut each strip in half lengthways so you have 10<span class="text-danger"> [20]</span> fingers

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges

Add the tofu fingers to a bowl with the soy sauce and juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and set aside to marinate – these are your marinated tofu fingers

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add 60g <span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour to a bowl with the curry powder, white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add 80ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> cold water and mix thoroughly until combined – this is your batter

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate

### Step 4

Dip each marinated tofu finger into the batter, tap off any excess, then add them to the panko breadcrumbs (turn several times to coat completely) – these are your breaded tofu fingers

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to fully coat the bottom of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded tofu fingers to the pan and cook for 6-8 min, turning occasionally, until golden and crispy – these are your crispy tofu fingers

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Roughly chop the capers and dill

Add the mayo to a small bowl with the chopped capers, chopped dill, juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and a generous grind of black pepper

Give it a good mix up – this is your tartare sauce

Tip: If your tartare sauce is looking a little thick, add a small splash of water!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1607349526713-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiling water and cook on a high heat for 2-3 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return the peas to the pot

Crush the cooked peas roughly with a potato masher

Stir through the mint sauce and a pinch of salt – these are your minty peas

### Step 8

Serve the crispy tofu fingers with the minty peas and chips to the side

Dollop over the tartare sauce and garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!
