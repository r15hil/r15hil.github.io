### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and reserve the pot

### Step 2

Add half your natural yoghurt and most of your curry powder to a large bowl (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your ground paprika and garam masala with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your Tandoori-style marinade

### Step 3

Add your chicken breast strips to the Tandoori-style marinade

Give everything a good mix up until the chicken is completely coated – this is your marinated chicken

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), over a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the marinated chicken breast strips and cook for 6-7 min on each side until lightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Tandoori-style chicken strips

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your cucumber into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Top, tail and coarsely grate your carrot[s]

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

### Step 6

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with the chopped cucumber and tomato wedges

Add a squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1720536500643-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are cooked, add a knob of butter to the reserved pot with your black mustard seeds, ginger & garlic paste, remaining curry powder and a generous pinch of salt

Cook over a medium heat for 30 secs or until the butter has melted and the spices are fragrant, then add the cooked potatoes to the pot

Stir it all together and cook for a final 1 min or until fragrant and the potatoes are well coated – these are your curried potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the Tandoori-style chicken strips with the curried potatoes and zingy salad to the side

Add the remaining natural yoghurt and your mango chutney to the side

Top with your crispy onions and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
