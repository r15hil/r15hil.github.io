- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 25g fresh chilli jam
- 100g carrots
- 3 fine egg noodle nests
- 1 honey pot (25g)
- 1 peanut butter pot (26g)
- 4 spring onions
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar 
- 5 soy sauce sachets (40ml)
- 2 tbsp tahini paste
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Deseed the red and yellow peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut them into thin strips (as finely as you can!)


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Combine the peanut butter,&nbsp;tahini paste&nbsp;and 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl&nbsp;with a whisk until smooth


Add the fresh&nbsp;chilli jam, toasted sesame oil, honey, rice vinegar and soy sauce sachets and mix to combine &ndash; this is your peanut &amp; sesame sauce


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the yellow and red pepper strips and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to char&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, trim then slice the spring onions&nbsp;lengthways into strips, then into three&nbsp;


Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Bash the roasted peanuts with a rolling pin&nbsp;until roughly crushed (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)


Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Once the peppers are charred, add the chopped spring onion and cook for 2 min further or until softened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the&nbsp;fine egg&nbsp;noodles&nbsp;to a pot and cover with&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min until tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain the&nbsp;noodles, reserving a cup of&nbsp;starchy noodle water


### Step 7

Once done, add the cooked noodles to the vegetable pan with the&nbsp;peanut &amp; sesame sauce


Reduce the heat to medium, add the grated carrot and give everything a good old mix up until the sauce sticks to the noodles &ndash; these are your nutty sesame &amp; vegetable noodles


Tip: add a splash of starchy noodle water to loosen the mixture if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the nutty sesame &amp; vegetable noodles topped with the crushed peanuts


Garnish with the black sesame seeds


Enjoy!
