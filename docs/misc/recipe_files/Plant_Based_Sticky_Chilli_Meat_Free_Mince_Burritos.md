## Ingredients

- Meatless Farm mince (200g)
- Gem lettuce
- Tomato
- Agave nectar (25g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Brown basmati rice (80g)
- Lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the mince is cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Combine the juice of half your lime[s] with your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime mayo


### Step 4

Once the meat-free mince is browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your agave and cook for 2-3 min or until the meat-free mince becomes crispy and sticky – this is your sticky chilli meat-free mince


### Step 5

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Fluff the brown rice with a fork and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Build your own burritos by layering up a warmed tortilla with some brown rice, a spoonful of chopped tomato and shredded lettuce and a dollop of the sticky chilli meat-free mince

Drizzle over the lime mayo, then roll your burritos up tightly

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
