### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper, then add the pastry to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the string from the turkey joint<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, season with a pinch of salt and add it to one side of the puff pastry

### Step 2

Roll the turkey joint up in the pastry (like a sausage roll!) and then pinch the sides together to seal it

Score the top of the pastry with a fork and season with a pinch of salt – this is your turkey wellington

Tip: Cooking for 4? Repeat this process!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 35-40 min or until the pastry is golden and the turkey is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Once the wellington is in the oven, boil a full kettle

Remove the tough stalks from the cavolo nero and chop finely

Tip: Bunch up the leaves and roll them like a cigar before slicing!

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 4

Peel the potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 5

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, reboil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped cavolo nero with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until wilted

### Step 6

Whilst the cavolo nero is cooking, dissolve the beef stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water

Once the cavolo nero is done, transfer it to a plate and cover tightly with tin-foil to keep warm until serving – this is your garlic cavolo nero

Wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1636447059059-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once melted, add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and give it a good mix up until a sandy-like paste has formed – this is your roux

Stir in the beef stock and add the wholegrain mustard and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your mustardy gravy

Meanwhile, return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Slice the two ends from the turkey wellington<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> slices

Serve the sliced turkey wellington with the mash and garlic cavolo nero to the side

Drizzle over the mustard gravy

Enjoy!
