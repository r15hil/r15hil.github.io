## Description

Savour The Summer with this sweet, umami-rich hoisin chicken, with added fresh plums for fruitiness. We like to think of it as Chinese barbecue chicken. Served with charred, nutrient-packed pak choi and some steamed sesame rice. It's tasty and (hoi)sinless! If you're feeling the heat, why not try cooking the chicken on the barbecue...

## Ingredients

- 250g pak choi 
- 2 tbsp toasted sesame oil 
- 150g fragrant basmati rice 
- 2 plums
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 4 British chicken thigh fillets 
- 1/2 tsp fiery chilli flakes 
- 2 spring onions
- 2 soy sauce sachets (16ml)
- 2 tbsp hoisin sauce 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7 and season the chicken with the chilli flakes (can&rsquo;t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt


Heat a large, wide-based pan (with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil


Once hot, cook the chicken for 2 min or until golden brown


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice the pak choi in half, lengthways


Transfer the golden chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put it in the&nbsp;oven for 12-15 min&nbsp;


Return&nbsp;the pan to a high heat and once hot, add the pak choi, cut-side down and cook for 2-3 min or until charred&nbsp;


Once done, transfer the pak choi to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Add the rice, 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid over a high heat and bring to the boil


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dice the plums&nbsp;finely, discarding the stones


Return&nbsp;the pan to a medium-low heat and once hot, add the plums with 100ml<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[200ml]</span>&nbsp;water


Cook&nbsp;for 2-4 min


### Step 5

Add&nbsp;the hoisin, soy sauce, sesame seeds and&nbsp;1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar and cook for 1-2 min&nbsp;or until the sauce has a thin jam-like consistency


Once&nbsp;done, remove from the heat and stir in half the toasted sesame oil - this is your hoisin plum sauce


### Step 6

Remove the chicken thighs from the oven and push them to one side of the tray


Spoon a little&nbsp;of the hoisin-plum sauce over each chicken thigh, add the pak choi to the same tray and return the tray to the oven for a final 5 min


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice the spring onion&nbsp;finely, discarding the root ends


Once cooked, fluff&nbsp;the rice with a fork and stir in the spring onion and remaining toasted sesame oil

### Step 8

Serve&nbsp;the chicken over the rice, with the pak choi to the side


Drizzle with the remaining sauce&nbsp;


Enjoy!
