## Ingredients

- British diced chicken breast (125g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Courgette
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Farfalle (100g) x0
- British diced chicken breast (250g)
- Parsley & chive (10g)
- Farfalle (200g)
- Garlic clove x3
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chives and parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut your lemon[s] into quarters

Combine the chopped garlic with half of the chopped herbs, a squeeze of lemon juice and 25g <span class="text-purple">[40g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[50g]</span> butter – this is your garlic & herb butter

Tip: Put the butter in the microwave for 10 secs if it's too cold to mix!


### Step 3

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then into batons

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your soft cheese – this is your creamy stock


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until golden

Once golden, remove the chicken and set aside, reserve the pan

Tip: It’s okay if the chicken's a little pink on the inside, it’ll get cooked more later


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of the garlic & herb butter (you'll use the rest later!)

Once melted, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Gradually stir in the creamy stock, a little at a time (to prevent lumps forming)


### Step 6

Add the drained farfalle and chicken pieces to the pan with the creamy sauce and give it a good mix up – this is your farfalle mixture

Transfer the farfalle mixture to an oven-proof dish

Combine your panko breadcrumbs and grated Italian hard cheese in a bowl with the remaining chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of vegetable oil – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs


### Step 7

Sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumbs all over the farfalle

Dollop the remaining garlic & herb butter over the breadcrumbs and put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken breast kyiv pasta bake

Add the courgette batons to a baking tray with a squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

### Step 8

Serve the chicken breast kyiv pasta bake with the oven-roasted courgette batons to the side

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!
