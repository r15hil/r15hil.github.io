## Description

We've taken influence from the classic tapas dish 'gambas pil pil' (prawns with chilli and garlic) and made a meal of it, literally. You will serve juicy spicy, garlicky tomato king prawns, spiced with chilli flakes and smoky paprika over a sunny coloured rice with green peppers and red onion. Drizzled with aioli (garlic mayonnaise). HOLA!

## Ingredients

- 3 tomatoes
- 150g fragrant basmati rice
- 10g fresh coriander
- 180g raw peeled king prawns
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1 green pepper
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp fiery chilli flakes
- 1 tsp bright yellow turmeric
- 3 garlic cloves 
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large bite-size pieces


Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into large pieces


<span style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span>


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the peppers and onion with a large pinch of salt


Cook for 5 min, or until they have softened slightly


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Combine the mayonnaise with 1/4 of the chopped garlic&nbsp;


Add the white wine vinegar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix vigorously into a smooth vinaigrette - this is your aioli&nbsp;


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water


Add the turmeric,&nbsp;rice&nbsp;and remaining garlic to the softened onion and pepper and stir to coat the grains in oil and spice&nbsp;


Add the stock and bring to the boil


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low, and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the water has absorbed - this is your spicy rice


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes into wedges&nbsp;


Add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and smoked paprika to a dry pan and cook over a medium heat for 10-20 sec or until they are starting to smell fragrant&nbsp;


Tip: watch the spices like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the tomatoes and a large pinch of salt and cook them for 4 min or until they have started to break down&nbsp;


Meanwhile, chop the coriander&nbsp;roughly, including the stalks&nbsp;


### Step 7

Add the prawns to the tomatoes, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 3-4 min or until they have turned opaque and you are left with prawns in a light tomato sauce&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Fluff the cooked rice and stir in the coriander (save a little for garnish!)


Serve the prawns over the spicy rice with the aioli drizzled over and garnish with the remaining coriander&nbsp;


Enjoy!
