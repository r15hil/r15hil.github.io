## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 20g mango chutney
- 2 tomatoes
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 2 plain naans

- 1 green pepper
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Peel and finely slice the brown onions

Trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop into bite sized pieces

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Boil a kettle

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped aubergine and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt

Cook for 5-7 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and mango chutney in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 4

Once the onions have softened, add the garam masala, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato wedges and stock and give everything a good mix up - this is your vegetable rogan josh


### Step 5

Transfer the vegetable rogan josh to an oven-proof dish

Put the dish in the oven and cook for an initial 10-15 min or until the stock is starting to thicken and the tomatoes have softened


### Step 6

While the oven works its magic, roughly tear the naan bread

Pick the coriander leaves from their stalks


### Step 7

Once the tomatoes have softened, top the vegetable rogan josh with the naan bread pieces

Drizzle with vegetable oil and sprinkle with the nigella seeds

Return the dish to the oven for a final 10-15 min or until the naan is crisp and golden - this is your naan-topped vegetable rogan josh pie

### Step 8

Leave to stand for 5 min before serving

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!
