Add the chopped potato then bring to boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for an initial 15 min or until the potatoes are tender – this is your chorizo chowder

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it sticking!

### Step 5

While the chowder is cooking, drain and rinse your butter beans and wash your shredded kale then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the potatoes are tender, add your soft cheese, kale and drained butter beans to the chorizo chowder, stir it all together and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 5 min or until the kale is wilted and the butter beans are warmed through

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season on both sides with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the sea bass to the pan, skin side down, and cook for 5 min

Tip: Try not to move the sea bass around the pan, as this will prevent it from crisping up!

### Step 7

### Step 8

Serve the crispy sea bass over the chorizo chowder in a large bowl

Enjoy!
