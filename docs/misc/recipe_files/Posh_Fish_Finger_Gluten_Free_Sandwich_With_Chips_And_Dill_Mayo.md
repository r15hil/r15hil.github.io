### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half

Once the pan is hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving (reserve the pan for later)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour and ground turmeric with a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your cornflour mixture

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar, chopped dill and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dill mayo

Drizzle any remaining dill mayo over the shredded lettuce

Enjoy!
