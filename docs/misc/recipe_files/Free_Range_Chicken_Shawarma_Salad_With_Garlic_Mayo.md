### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your chips

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced onion to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

Peel and finely grate your garlic

### Step 3

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, drain the sliced onion in a sieve and run under cold water until cooled

Return the drained onion to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix it all together and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled pink onion

### Step 5

Wash your lettuce[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then chop roughly

### Step 6

Add the shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and chopped cucumber to a separate bowl with the quick-pickled pink onion and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled onion salad

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer to a clean board and slice finely – this is your sliced free range chicken shawarma

### Step 8

Serve the sliced free range chicken shawarma over the quick-pickled onion salad with the chips to the side

Drizzle over the garlic mayo

Enjoy!
