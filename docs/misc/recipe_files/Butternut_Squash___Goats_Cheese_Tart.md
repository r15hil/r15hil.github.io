## Ingredients

- 75g goats' cheese
- 1 butternut squash cubes
- 1 puff pastry
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 5g rosemary
- 80g spinach
- 25g pecan nuts
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-15 min or until the butternut squash is starting to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, snap your pecans in half, lengthways

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pecan halves, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> cold water

Cook for 8-10 min or until the liquid has reduced

Remove the pan from the heat and leave the pecans to harden – these are your candied pecans


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Once the butternut squash is starting to soften, add the sliced onion to the tray[s] with the butternut squash and return to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until everything's softened

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add half (you'll use the rest later!) to a colander

Pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper, then add the pastry square[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Tip: Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 6

Once the squash is cooked, gently spread the centre of the pastry square with your goats' cheese using the back of a spoon

Top with the roasted butternut squash, half of the roasted onion (save the rest for later!), the wilted spinach and the rosemary leaves

Drizzle with a little olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the pastry is cooked through, golden and the edges have puffed up – this is your butternut squash & goats' cheese tart


### Step 7

Whilst the tart is cooking, add your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt to a large bowl

Add the remaining roasted onion, remaining spinach and candied pecans and give everything a good mix up – this is your spinach & pecan salad

### Step 8

Serve the butternut squash & goats' cheese tart with the spinach & pecan salad to the side

Enjoy!
