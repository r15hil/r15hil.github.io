## Ingredients

- 160g trimmed fine green beans
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 50g soft cheese
- 160g butternut squash cubes
- 185g canned green lentils
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 15ml Henderson's Relish 
- 15g flaked almonds
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 30ml soy sauce
- 5g thyme
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Whilst the onion is softening, top, tail and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely, then drain and rinse the green lentils and grate the cheddar cheese

Once the onion has softened, add the diced carrot, butternut squash cubes, drained lentils, 2/3 of the panko breadcrumbs, half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and the grated cheese to the pan

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your veggie loaf mixture


### Step 3

Line a loaf tin (23 x13 x7cm) with non-stick baking paper and grease with vegetable oil

Add the veggie loaf mixture to the prepared tin, pressing down into the corners and smoothing the top over with a spatula

Put the tin in the oven for 40 min or until browned and firm in the middle, reserve the pan – this is your squash loaf

Tip: If you don't have a loaf tin, shape into a log instead!


### Step 4

While the veggie loaf is in the oven, peel the potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 5

Meanwhile, strip the thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the chopped thyme, flaked almonds and remaining panko breadcrumbs

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly golden, then transfer to a small bowl, reserving the pan – this is your herby almond crumb


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until a sandy paste forms

Whisk in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water with the Henderson's Relish, remaining soy sauce and a generous grind of black pepper, and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened (this can be quickly reheated before serving!) – this is your gravy


### Step 7

Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper, then lay the green beans in the middle with a knob of butter, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the beans to form sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and put in the oven for 10-12 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with the soft cheese and a splash of milk, season with a generous pinch of salt and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Gently turn the squash loaf out onto a chopping board, let it cool slightly, then slice thickly

Serve the squash loaf slices with the creamy mash and green beans to the side

Top the beans with the herby almond crumb and drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!
