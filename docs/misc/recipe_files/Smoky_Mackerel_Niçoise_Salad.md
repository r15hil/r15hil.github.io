## Description

Salade niçoise (French pronunciation: 'ni’ swaz') is traditionally presented as a composed salad of tomatoes, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies, dressed with a vinaigrette. The Gousto version uses our locally sourced British mackerel and a punchy vinaigrette for a hearty and healthy dinner salad. Nice-oise!

## Ingredients

- 120g fine green beans
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 
- 100g British smoked mackerel fillet
- 125g baby plum tomatoes
- 400g potatoes
- 1 red gem lettuce
- 30g pitted black olives 
- 1 tsp French Dijon mustard
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 British free range eggs

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-size pieces


Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10 min or until fork-tender


Re-boil a kettle


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Add the eggs to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)


Once boiling, boil for exactly&nbsp;8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs


Once done, cool the eggs by running them under cold water for 3 min


Tip: cooling the eggs completely makes them easier to peel


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the&nbsp;green beans&nbsp;in half


Rip the&nbsp;red gem lettuce&nbsp;into rough bite-size pieces


### Step 4

Chop the&nbsp;black olives&nbsp;roughly


Cut the&nbsp;baby plum tomatoes&nbsp;in half


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are nearly fork tender, add the chopped green beans to the pot and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite


Once done, drain and return to the pot


Add a generous drizzle of olive oil with&nbsp;a pinch of salt and pepper to the potatoes and beans&nbsp;and mix to combine


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the red wine vinegar and dijon mustard with 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl


Peel the garlic and grate it into the bowl (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!) - this is your french dressing


### Step 7

Peel and quarter the cooled eggs


Peel the skin from the smoked mackerel and discard


Break the smoked mackerel into rough, bite-size pieces

### Step 8

Assemble your ni&ccedil;oise salad with the red gem, eggs, olives, tomatoes, potatoes and green beans


Drizzle over&nbsp;the french dressing


Enjoy!&nbsp;
