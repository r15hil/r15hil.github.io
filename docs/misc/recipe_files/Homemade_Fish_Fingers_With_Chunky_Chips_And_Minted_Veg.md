## Ingredients

- 4 tbsp cornflour
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 4 white potatoes
- 160g blanched peas
- 30ml tomato ketchup 
- 80g mangetout
- 5g mint

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips

Add the chunky chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, combine the cornflour and ground turmeric with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your cornflour mixture


### Step 3

Cut the basa fillets into strips

Add the basa strips to the bowl with the cornflour mixture and combine until they’re fully coated


### Step 4

Strip the mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems and chop finely

Slice the mangetout in half at an angle

Boil a full kettle


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through, golden and crisp – these are your homemade fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the sliced mangetout and blanched peas to a pot, covering them with boiled water until fully submerged and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2 min or until tender with a slight bite


### Step 7

Once the peas and mangetout are tender, drain them and return them to the pot with a knob of butter and the chopped mint

Stir it all together – this is your minted veg

### Step 8

Serve the homemade fish fingers with the chunky chips, minted veg and ketchup to the side

Enjoy!
