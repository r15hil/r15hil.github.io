- 80g sugar snap peas
- 400g potatoes
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp dried dill
- 1 lemon

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips 


Add the chips to a baking tray with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Boil a kettle


Combine the mayonnaise with the dried dill, the <span class="text-highlight">juice</span> of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and a pinch of salt – this is your dill mayonnaise


### Step 3

Once the chips are almost cooked, pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork


Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate


Coat the fish fillets in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them into the beaten egg and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat 


Once hot, add the breaded fish and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice the sugar snap peas into halves diagonally


Cut the remaining 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon into wedges


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the sugar snap peas to a pot and cover them in plenty of boiled water


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender


Once tender, drain the sugar snap peas and return them to the pot with a <span class="text-highlight">drizzle of olive oil</span>

### Step 8

Serve the crispy fish with the chips, sugar snap peas and dill mayonnaise to the side


Garnish with a wedge of lemon


Enjoy!
