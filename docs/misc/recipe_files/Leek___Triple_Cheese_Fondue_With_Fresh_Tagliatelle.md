## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and your roasted garlic paste with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your mozzarella and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Combine the grated cheddar, torn mozzarella and your grated Italian hard cheese with your cornflour in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until everything is fully coated – this is your floured cheese mixture


### Step 6

Once the leek has softened, add the floured cheese mixture to the pan with your Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> milk

Bring to a boil over a medium heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 2-3 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and thickened – this is your triple cheese fondue


### Step 7

Add the drained tagliatelle to the triple cheese fondue and stir everything together – this is your leek & triple cheese fondue with fresh tagliatelle

### Step 8

Serve the leek & triple cheese fondue with fresh tagliatelle topped with a good grind of black pepper

Garnish with your crispy onions

Chop your chives roughly over the dish with scissors

Enjoy!
