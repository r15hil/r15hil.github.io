- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 18 min


### Step 2

Pat your basa fillets dry with kitchen paper

Add half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it together

Add the basa fillets to the plate and turn until fully coated, then set aside – these are your smoky basa fillets


### Step 3

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 4

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 5

After the initial 18 min, remove the tray from the oven

Add the chopped tomatoes and chopped green beans to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Add the smoky basa fillets to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Return the tray to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through, the potatoes are crisp and the vegetables have softened – this is your smoky basa tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl and mix it all together – this is your harissa mayo

### Step 8

Serve the smoky basa tray bake with the harissa mayo drizzled over the top

Enjoy!
