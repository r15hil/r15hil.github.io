Before you begin...

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy bacon & pea sauce with fresh orecchiette

Serve the creamy bacon & pea sauce with fresh orecchiette topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Drizzle over the basil oil and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
