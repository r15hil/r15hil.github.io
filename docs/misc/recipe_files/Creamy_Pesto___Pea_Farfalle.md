Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soft cheese and a good grind of pepper and cook for 2 min or until the soft cheese has started to melt


### Step 5

Once starting to melt, add the vegetable stock and cook for 1-2 min or until combined

Once combined, add your traditional Italian pesto and cook for a further 1-2 min or until creamy and starting to thicken


### Step 6

While the sauce is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Add the drained pasta, blanched peas and a splash of starchy pasta water to the sauce and cook for a further 2-3 min, stirring constantly until fully combined – this is your creamy pesto & pea farfalle

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
