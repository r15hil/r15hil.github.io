Peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces 


Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks (keep this aside for garnish later)


Cut up 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> A3 size sheets of baking paper


### Step 3

Lay each cod fillet in the middle of 2 pieces (doubling it up prevents any leakages!)

Squeeze a lemon quarter over each piece of cod and season generously with salt and black pepper
