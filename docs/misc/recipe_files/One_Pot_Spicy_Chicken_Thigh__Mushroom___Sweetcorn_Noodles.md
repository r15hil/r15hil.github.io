## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Slice your chestnut mushrooms


### Step 3

Add your diced chicken thigh to the dish and cook for 1 min or until lightly browned all over


### Step 4

Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 5

Add the sliced mushrooms, crushed garlic, drained sweetcorn and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the dish

Add your chicken stock mix with 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1.2L] </span>boiled water, your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and your soy sauce

Stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until everything's cooked through (no pink meat!) and tender

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] and set aside for serving

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven, give everything a stir and add your medium egg noodles

Tip: Nestle the noodles into the sauce for even cooking!

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the noodles are tender – these are your one pot spicy chicken thigh, mushroom & sweetcorn noodles

### Step 8

Serve the one pot spicy chicken thigh, mushroom & sweetcorn noodles and drizzle your toasted sesame oil all over

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and your toasted sesame seeds

Dig in!
