## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

While the onion and pepper are cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tortiglioni and set it aside until later

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 4

Slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the onion and pepper are starting to soften, add the tomato stock to the pan with the halved tomatoes and dried oregano and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened

Once thickened, stir the cooked tortiglioni through the tomato sauce and season generously with black pepper


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Transfer the pasta to an oven-proof dish and top with the grated cheese and torn mozzarella

Lay your sliced pepperoni over the top then put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden on top – this is your cheesy pepperoni pasta bake

Roughly tear your basil leaves

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy pepperoni pasta bake and garnish with the torn basil leaves

Enjoy!
