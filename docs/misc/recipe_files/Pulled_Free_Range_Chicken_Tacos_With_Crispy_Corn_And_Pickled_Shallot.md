### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Drain your sweetcorn, then add it to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until crispy

### Step 2

While the corn is in the oven, peel your garlic

Cut your green chilli[es] in half and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Peel and halve your shallot[s]

Cut your pepper[s] into quarters (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

### Step 3

Add the garlic to a food processor with most of your coriander (reserve a few leaves for garnish!), the halved chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half of the shallot[s] and pepper quarters

Add your toasted sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds, season with a generous pinch of salt and blitz into a rough paste – this is your pepper paste

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and creamed coconut in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> [300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Finely slice the remaining shallot

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and mix well – this is your quick-pickled shallot

### Step 6

Once golden, add the pepper paste to the chicken and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Add the coconut stock and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled free range chicken

### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the pulled free range chicken, crispy corn and quick-pickled shallot

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
