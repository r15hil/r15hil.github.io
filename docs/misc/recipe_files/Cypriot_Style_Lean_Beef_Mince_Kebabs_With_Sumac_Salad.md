### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel your red onion[s] and slice half very finely

Finely dice (or grate) the remaining red onion

Chop half the parsley finely, including the stalks (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 2

Add your lean beef mince, panko breadcrumbs, diced onion, chopped garlic, chopped parsley, dried oregano and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your lean beef mince kebab mixture

### Step 3

Divide the lean beef mince kebab mixture into 3 kebabs per person and roll into small sausage shapes – these are your Cypriot-style lean beef mince kebabs

Lightly oil a baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil and add the Cypriot-style lean beef mince kebabs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the kebabs are cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)

Whilst the kebabs are cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice roughly on a diagonal

Dice your tomato[es]

Roughly tear your remaining parsley

### Step 5

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this are your chilli pitta[s]

### Step 7

Add the sliced cucumber, diced tomato, sliced onion and torn parsley to a bowl

Add your natural yoghurt with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of half your lemon[s], half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and cut the chilli pitta[s] in half

### Step 8

Serve the Cypriot-style lean beef mince kebabs with the sumac salad and chilli pittas to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining ground sumac and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!
