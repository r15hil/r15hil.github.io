## Description

We like to describe this as savoury 'n' sweet, with a touch of heat. You'll glaze lean British beef mince and carrot in a sticky chilli sauce, before serving over fragrant coriander noodles. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and chopped shallot and cook for 4 min until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim, then roughly chop your spring onions

Chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Once the lean beef is browned, add the grated carrot and cook for a further 3 min or until the lean beef mince is crisped


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until tender, then drain, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water

Once drained, return the noodles to the pot and set aside


### Step 6

Once the lean beef has crisped, add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add the red chilli relish and half of your soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 4 min or until everything is browned, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lean crispy chilli beef


### Step 7

Return the pot of drained noodles to a medium heat

Add the chopped spring onion and remaining soy sauce to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and stir together until fully combined

Tip: Add a small splash of starchy noodle water if you need to loosen the noodles

Once combined, remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped coriander – these are your coriander noodles

### Step 8

Serve the lean crispy chilli beef over the coriander noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
