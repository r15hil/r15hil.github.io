## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan with your curry powder and the rinsed red lentils

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, chopped pepper and chopped creamed coconut with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 4

Add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are tender – this is your coconut curry dal


### Step 5

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 6

Meanwhile, trim your green beans


### Step 7

Add the trimmed green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a small pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite

### Step 8

Serve the coconut curry dal with the cooked rice and green beans to the side

Enjoy!
