## Description

For this tempting tray bake you'll marinate chicken thighs in a teriyaki-inspired sauce, then bake till tender with red onion and broccoli. You'll use the remaining marinade to make a tangy sauce to drizzle over. Serve with basmati rice, spring onion and sesame seeds. (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).
