## Ingredients

- 5 basil
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 16g tomato paste
- 32g tomato paste
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 190g spaghetti
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 20g capers
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 10g basil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your capers and cook for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until crispy


### Step 2

While the capers are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once the capers are crispy, transfer them to a plate and return the pan (and any remaining oil!) to a medium heat

Add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

Dissolve your tomato paste and your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the halved tomatoes, sliced garlic, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the tomatoes have broken down into a sauce

Once broken down, add your tomato stock with a pinch of sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

While the pasta is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the drained spaghetti to the sauce with half the chopped basil and half the crispy capers (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the sauce coats the pasta – this is your Amatriciana spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve your Amatriciana spaghetti and garnish with the remaining crispy capers and chopped basil

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
