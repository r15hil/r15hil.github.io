### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins-on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 8

Serve the herby feta mash with the harissa meat-free mince ragù to the side

Crumble over the remaining feta and sprinkle over the remaining chopped herbs

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
