## Ingredients

- Ground paprika (1tsp)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground allspice (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Lime
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Sweet potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into chips, then add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your ground paprika, your<span class="text-danger"> </span>ground allspice, your cayenne pepper, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), vegetable stock mix and a generous pinch of salt to a plate

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your Caribbean-style seasoning

Press your basa fillet[s] into the Caribbean-style seasoning so that one side is fully coated


### Step 3

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)


### Step 4

Combine your mayo with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and the lime zest in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo


### Step 5

Add your blanched peas to a pot with a lid, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and add a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 6

Return the drained peas to the pot with a knob of butter, the chopped coriander, the juice of the remaining lime and a pinch of salt

Mash the peas with a masher until they come together nicely

Stir through the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and keep covered until serving – these are your chilli-lime mushy peas


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the basa fillet[s] (spice-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until crispy, then cook for 3-4 min further on the other side or until cooked through – this is your Caribbean-style fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Caribbean-style fish with the sweet potato chips, chilli-lime mushy peas and lime mayo to the side

Enjoy!!
