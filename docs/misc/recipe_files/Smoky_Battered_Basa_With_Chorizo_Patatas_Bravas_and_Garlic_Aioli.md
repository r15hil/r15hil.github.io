### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your diced chorizo to a pot over a medium-low heat and cook for 5-6 min or until the chorizo is crispy

While the chorizo is cooking, dice your tomato[es]

Chop your black olives in half

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 3

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> boiled water and add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your tomato stock

Once the chorizo is crispy, increase the heat to medium-high, then add the diced tomato, half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!), tomato stock, a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 5-6 min or until the tomato has broken down and the sauce has reduced – this is your chorizo bravas sauce

### Step 4

While the chorizo bravas sauce is cooking, combine your mayo, the remaining grated garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice in a small bowl – this is your garlic & lemon aioli

Add your cornflour and 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g] </span><span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour to a large bowl with your ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt

Add 90ml <span class="text-purple">[135ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [180ml]</span> very cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky batter

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1678800930453-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut in half on a diagonal

Sprinkle both sides of the basa with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

Dip the floured basa into the smoky batter and turn it several times until fully coated

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your smoky battered basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily!

### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the chopped olives, salad and sliced shallot in a large bowl with a squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your black olive salad

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the smoky battered basa with the crispy potatoes and black olive salad to the side

Top the crispy potatoes with the chorizo bravas sauce – these are your chorizo patatas bravas

Drizzle the garlic & lemon aioli all over the chorizo patatas bravas and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
