## Ingredients

- 1 can of sweetcorn (198g)
- 25g chilli jam 
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (30ml)
- 130g bulgur wheat 
- 1 British free-range egg
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet 
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of salted boiled water (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, place your hand on the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> on a chopping board


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with <span class="text-highlight">2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> t</span>hinner pieces


### Step 3

Add a couple of handfuls of flour to a plate


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat them with a fork 


Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate


Dip the chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then into the egg and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 5-6 tbsp vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once very hot, add the panko crusted chicken and cook for 2-3 min each side or until golden 


Transfer the golden chicken to a baking tray (keep the pan for the next step) and put it in the oven for 6-10 min or until cooked through <span class="text-highlight">(no pink meat!)</span>


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter


Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min until it starts to brown slightly and smell sweet


### Step 6

Combine the chilli jam, red wine vinegar and mayonnaise with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chilli mayo


Meanwhile, trim then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 7

Stir the drained bulgur and spring onion into the sweetcorn and remove it from the heat <span class="text-highlight">–</span> this is your sweetcorn bulgur


Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Once cooked, season the golden chicken generously with salt and pepper and serve it over the sweetcorn bulgur <span class="text-highlight">with the</span> chilli mayo to the side


Enjoy!
