### Step 1

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a heat proof bowl then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 5-10 min or until fork-tender

### Step 3

Wash your kale, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted kale under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the kale as you can

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the cooked sweet potato (careful not to tip any of the water into the pan) and a pinch of salt

Crush the potatoes lightly and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Tip: Stir as little as possible to give the potatoes a chance to brown

### Step 5

Once the potatoes are starting to brown, add your diced chorizo to the pan with the sliced red onion and a pinch of salt

Cook for a further 6-7 min, stirring occasionally, until the chorizo is cooked through and everything is beginning to crisp

Tip: Reduce the heat to low if the potatoes start to burn!

### Step 6

Once everything is beginning to crisp, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground paprika and ground cumin

Cook for 1 min further until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the wilted kale, give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the kale has softened â€“ this is your sweet potato & chorizo hash

### Step 7

Make a well per person in the sweet potato & chorizo hash and crack your eggs into them

Cook, covered for 3-4 min or until the eggs are done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack them for perfectly centred yolks!

### Step 8

Serve the sweet potato & chorizo hash with the smashed avocado dolloped on top

Enjoy!
