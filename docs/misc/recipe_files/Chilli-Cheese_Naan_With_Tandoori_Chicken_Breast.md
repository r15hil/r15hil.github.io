### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice thickly

### Step 2

Combine your ground smoked paprika and curry powder with half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add the chicken breast portions and sliced pepper to the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

### Step 3

Add the coated chicken breast portions and pepper to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-22 min or until the red pepper is slightly charred and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

While the chicken is in the oven, cut your green chilli[es] in quarters lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 6

Once the tandoori chicken is cooked, remove the baking tray[s] from the oven

Transfer the tandoori chicken to a clean board, reserving the tray[s]

Re-line the reserved baking tray[s] with baking paper, add your plain naans and top with the grated cheddar, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and charred pepper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1682416405392-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 4 min or until the bread is warmed through and the cheese has melted – this is your chilli-cheese naan

Meanwhile, shred apart the tandoori chicken using two forks – this is your pulled tandoori chicken

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chilli-cheese naan with the spinach and pulled tandoori chicken layered on top  – this is your chilli-cheese naan with tandoori chicken

Drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
