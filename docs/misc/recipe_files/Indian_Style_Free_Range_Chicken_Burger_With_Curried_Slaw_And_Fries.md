## Ingredients

- Garam masala (1tsp)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Ground paprika (1tsp)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ciabatta x2
- White potato x3
- White wine vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries, add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25 min or until starting to crisp – these are your paprika fries


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your free range chicken thighs to a bowl with your ground cumin, garam masala and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Once done, transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced free range chicken


### Step 5

Combine your mango chutney and half of your mayo (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo


### Step 6

Once the fries have been in the oven for an initial 25 min, move them to one side of the trays[s] and add your ciabatta[s] to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the ciabatta is hot and toasted

Carefully slice the toasted ciabatta in half before serving


### Step 7

Add your white wine vinegar to a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar<span class="text-danger"> </span>and mix until dissolved

Stir in your curry powder and remaining mayo

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your curried slaw

### Step 8

Top your toasted ciabatta base with a dollop of mango mayo, the spiced free range chicken, a handful of curried slaw and the toasted ciabatta lid – this is your Indian-style free range chicken burger

Serve the paprika fries and remaining curried slaw to the side

Enjoy!
