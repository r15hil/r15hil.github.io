## Description

All the ingredients in our lamb moussaka are true to the classic. The lamb is spiced and gently cooked with onions, warm cinnamon and oregano. It’s layered up with aubergine, potato and tomato sauce. We’ve topped it off with yoghurt instead of béchamel which gives a light but creamy texture and less kitchen work!

## Ingredients

- 250g British lamb mince 
- 1 little gem lettuce
- 2 tbsp rich tomato paste 
- 1 beef stock cube
- 300g potatoes 
- 120g organic natural yoghurt
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 aubergine 
- 1 tbsp Italian dried oregano
- 1 onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7 and boil a kettle&nbsp;


Slice the potatoes (skins on) into approx. 1cm thick slices


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the lamb mince


Cook for 4-5 min, breaking it up with a spoon as you go


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and cook for 7 min, or until they're just about fork-tender


Peel and finely dice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic 


Add the onion, garlic, cinnamon and dried oregano to the lamb mince and cook for 10 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 1cm thick slices


Add them to a baking tray and drizzle with olive oil and a large pinch of salt and pepper


Put the tray in the oven for 15 min, or until cooked through, turning halfway through


### Step 4

Dissolve the beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water


Stir the tomato paste&nbsp;and&nbsp;beef stock&nbsp;into the lamb mince


Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-15 min or until most of the water has evaporated


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 5

Meanwhile, pop a tbsp of&nbsp;natural yoghurt&nbsp;into a mixing bowl with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;and a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and&nbsp;pepper&nbsp;- this is your&nbsp;yoghurt dressing&nbsp;


Tear the&nbsp;little gem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into bite-size pieces


### Step 6

When ready, add half of the sliced potato to a suitably sized oven-proof dish in a single layer


Layer over half of the sliced aubergine&nbsp;


### Step 7

Spoon half of the lamb mince&nbsp;over the sliced aubergine and repeat the layering process with the remaining potato, aubergine and lamb


Top with the remaining yoghurt and season with salt and pepper


Put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until it's bubbling and golden - this is your moussaka&nbsp;

### Step 8

Leave the moussaka to cool slightly before eating! It will improve the flavour and stop you burning your mouth!


Dress the salad with your yoghurt dressing when ready to serve&nbsp;


Enjoy!
