### Step 5

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 6

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)

### Step 7

Spread your tomato sauce over the pastry, keeping it within the borders

Top with the sliced tomato and roasted veg, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the pastry is golden, cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your courgette & tomato tart

Whilst the tart[s] is cooking, combine your mayo with a small splash of cold water and a grind of black pepper in a bowl – this is your pepper mayo

### Step 8

Serve the courgette & tomato tart with the wedges and pepper mayo to the side

Enjoy!
