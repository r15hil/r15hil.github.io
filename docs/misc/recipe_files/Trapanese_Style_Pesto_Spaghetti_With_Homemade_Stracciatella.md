## Ingredients

- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Rocket (20g)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Sun-dried tomato pesto (45g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Spaghetti (190g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Dried basil (1tsp)
- Ground almonds (25g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs and dried basil with a pinch of pepper

Cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden, then transfer to a plate and reserve the pan – these are your herby breadcrumbs


### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into small pieces and add them to a medium bowl with your soft cheese, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>cold water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good stir – this is your homemade stracciatella


### Step 3

Add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

While the spaghetti is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Wipe out the reserved pan and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 5

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the shallot has softened, add the halved tomatoes and garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min over a medium-high heat or until the tomatoes have softened


### Step 6

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the tomatoes have softened, add your tomato paste to the pan with your sun-dried tomato pesto, vegetable stock mix, ground almonds and a very generous splash of starchy pasta water

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant, then add the drained spaghetti

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 30 secs – this is your Trapanese-style pesto spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the Trapanese-style pesto spaghetti topped with the homemade stracciatella and herby breadcrumbs

Serve with the salad to the side and top with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
