### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 3

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

### Step 5

Once the pan is hot, remove it from the heat, then add the brown rice with your roasted garlic paste, grated carrot, shredded kale and sliced spring onion

Return the pan to the heat, then add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar and cook for 2-3 min or until fully combined

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 3 min or until cooked to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 7

Add the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan with the rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your nasi goreng

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the nasi goreng and top it with a fried egg

Garnish with the sliced cucumber, roasted peanuts and a lime wedge to the side

Squeeze over your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
