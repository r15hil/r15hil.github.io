## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the lamb is cooking, add your orzo to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orzo for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orzo


### Step 4

Peel and finely slice 1/4 of your red onion[s]

Combine your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl with the sliced red onion – this is your quick-pickled red onion

Cut the remaining red onion into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly


### Step 5

Reboil half a kettle

Once the lamb is browned, add the onion petals and chopped tomato to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 6

Reduce the heat to medium-high, then add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic, tomato paste, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground smoked paprika

Give everything a good mix up

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water with your beef stock mix and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 7

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has slightly thickened

Once thickened, add the drained orzo and give everything a good mix up – this is your lamb orzo

### Step 8

Serve the lamb orzo and drizzle over your natural yoghurt and mint sauce, then top with the quick-pickled red onion – this is your lamb souvlaki orzo with yoghurt and mint sauce

Enjoy!
