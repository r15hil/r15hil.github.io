## Instructions


### Step 1

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, ground turmeric and half your tomato paste (you'll use the rest later!) in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until they've softened slightly


### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice, tomato stock and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your spicy rice


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar, chipotle paste, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining tomato paste with the juice of half your lemon[s] in a large mixing bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your peri peri sauce


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain and add your king prawns with the peri peri sauce and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your peri peri king prawns


### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lemon into 2 wedges per person

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Combine your mayo with the juice of 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon wedge per person and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your lemon mayo

Add the shredded lettuce to the bowl with the lemon mayo, then give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony salad

### Step 8

Serve the peri peri king prawns with the spicy rice and lemony salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
