### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Cut the waxy potatoes (skins on) in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and leave them to steam dry (save the pot!)

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice into strips

Cut the halloumi into thick slices

Reboil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes, ground turmeric and coriander seeds and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp

### Step 6

Chop the parsley and dill finely, including the stalks

Once the potatoes are beginning to crisp, add the chopped garlic, chilli strips (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Remove the pan from the heat, add the chopped parsley and dill, then set aside for serving (save the pan!) – this is your batata harra

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the coated halloumi and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden – this is your baharat halloumi

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the baharat halloumi with the batata harra, green beans and a dollop of natural yoghurt to the side

Sprinkle the natural yoghurt with some sumac and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
