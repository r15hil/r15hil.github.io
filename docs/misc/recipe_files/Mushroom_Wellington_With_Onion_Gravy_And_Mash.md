### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Wash your shredded kale, then pat dry with kitchen paper, then peel your shallot[s] and garlic

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, season with salt and pepper and mash until smooth

### Step 3

Add the peeled garlic and shallot[s], chestnut mushrooms, dried sage and walnuts to a food processor and pulse for 3 secs or until roughly blitzed – this is your mushroom mixture

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop everything finely!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the mushroom mixture and soy sauce to the pan, then cook for 3-4 min or until all the liquid is absorbed

### Step 4

Meanwhile, line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person

Divide the mushroom mixture evenly between the pastry squares, covering one half, then fold the pastry over the mushroom mixture to form a sealed parcel[s] (reserve the pan)

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through – this is your mushroom Wellington

### Step 5

Once the Wellington is in the oven, cut a large<span class="text-danger"> </span>piece of tin foil (or two!) approx. the size of a sheet of A3 paper

Lay the shredded kale in the middle with a knob of butter and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and scrunch the edges of the foil around the shredded kale to form a sealed parcel[s] then place on a separate baking tray

Add the tray to the oven for 10-15 min or until tender – this is your roasted kale

### Step 6

Reboil half a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced onion with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and your balsamic vinegar and cook for 5-6 min until caramelised

While the onion is caramelising, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/RC2480Step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the onion has caramelised, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring until the onion is evenly coated in the flour

Pour in the vegetable stock and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your onion gravy

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom Wellington over the mash with the roasted kale to the side

Pour the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!
