## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Henderson's Relish (15ml) x2
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden and crispy – these are your black pepper chips


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot over a low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 20 min, stirring frequently, or until halved in size and golden

Tip: Cook the onions over a really low heat so they don't burn!

Once golden, add 3/4 of your Henderson's Relish (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min further or until dark and soft – these are your Henderson's caramelised onions


### Step 3

While the onions are caramelising, season your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide and shape into 1 patty per person and refrigerate until later


### Step 4

Combine the remaining Henderson's Relish and mayo in a bowl – this is your Henderson's mayo

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later


### Step 6

Return the pan to a high heat

Add the beef patty[ies] and cook for 5 min on one side, or until nicely browned

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 7

Once browned, flip the beef patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high, then top with the grated cheddar

Cover loosely with a lid (or some tin foil!) and cook for 5 min further or until the cheese has melted and the patty[ies] is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy patty[ies]

### Step 8

Spread the base and lid of the toasted bun with the Henderson's mayo

Build your burger by topping the base with the Henderson's caramelised onions, a cheesy patty, some shredded lettuce and the lid – this is your Henderson’s Relish beef burger

Serve with the black pepper chips to the side

Enjoy!
