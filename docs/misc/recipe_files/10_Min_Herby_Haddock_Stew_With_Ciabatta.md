Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

### Step 2

Now let's get started!


Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until warmed through


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan <span class="text-highlight">(preferably non-stick with a matching lid)</span> with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


Chop the spring onions roughly


Drain and rinse the cannellini beans


### Step 4

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion and cannellini beans to the pan and cook for 1 min


### Step 5

<span class="text-highlight">Next, add</span> 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> <span class="text-highlight">Knorr</span> vegetable stock cube to the pan with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat
