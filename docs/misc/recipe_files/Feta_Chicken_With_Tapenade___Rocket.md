### Step 1

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, but don't cut all the way through (think of the piece as an open book)


Lay a sheet of cling film or greaseproof paper over the opened&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and bash the&nbsp;chicken with a rolling pin to an even thickness throughout&nbsp;

### Step 2

Crumble up the feta


Arrange the crumbled&nbsp;feta over one side of the open&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and fold the other side over as though you're closing the book


Secure&nbsp;the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> together by threading the skewer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> through the opening (think sewing!)

### Step 3

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a lid with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil over a high heat


Add the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until browned&nbsp;


Add 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span>&nbsp;water to the&nbsp;pan


Cover with a lid and cook for 12-16 min or until the chicken is cooked and the juices run clear


Once cooked, transfer to a chopping board to rest

Meanwhile,&nbsp;chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped&nbsp;olives, chopped&nbsp;garlic, dried oregano&nbsp;and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;to a pestle and mortar


Grind to a coarse paste - this is your tapenade&nbsp;

Lightly crush the potatoes with a masher and set them aside


Wash, dry, then dress&nbsp;the rocket leaves with a splash of olive oil

### Step 8
