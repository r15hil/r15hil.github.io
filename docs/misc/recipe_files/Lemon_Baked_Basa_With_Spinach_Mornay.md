## Ingredients

- Spinach (120g)
- Spinach (80g) x0
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Basa fillet x0
- White potato x4
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into discs, approx. 1cm thick

Add them to a baking tray (or two), making sure they don't overlap


### Step 2

Drizzle the potato discs with olive oil, then season with a large pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and crispy – these are your crispy potato discs


### Step 3

Meanwhile, grate your Italian hard cheese

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut the lemon[s] into quarters

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop roughly


### Step 4

Melt 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter in a pot over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 5

Gradually whisk in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel

Remove from the heat until everything is almost ready to serve


### Step 6

Add your basa fillet[s] to a baking tray (or two) (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Drizzle the basa with olive oil, season lightly with salt and pepper and scatter the lemon zest all over

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your lemon baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Return the béchamel to a medium heat and warm for 1-2 min

Once warm, add the grated Italian hard cheese and chopped spinach and stir until the cheese has melted and the spinach has wilted – this is your spinach Mornay

Tip: Add a little water if the sauce is looking thick!

### Step 8

Serve the lemon baked basa with the spinach Mornay and the crispy potato discs to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
