- British chicken breast strips (250g)
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Skewers x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and chop half your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Slice the remaining red onion finely


### Step 3

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Combine your baharat and a drizzle of vegetable oil in a medium bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your marinade


### Step 4

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken and onion petals to the marinade

Give everything a good mix up, then thread the chicken and onion petals on to the soaked skewers


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken skewers and cook for 2 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, cover with a lid and cook for a further 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken shish kebabs


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with your mayo in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 7

Add your tomato ketchup to a separate bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Give it a good mix up – this is your chilli sauce

Once the chips are almost done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top the chips with your wholemeal pitta[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build, top the warmed pitta with 2 chicken shish kebabs and some of the shredded lettuce, onion slices and tomato wedges

Drizzle any cooking juices from the chicken pan, the garlic mayo and the chilli sauce over the top

Serve the chips and remaining shredded lettuce, onion slices and tomato wedges to the side

Enjoy!
