### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut in half lengthways

Score the aubergine flesh with a knife in a criss-cross pattern, then rub the flesh with your ras el hanout, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Add the aubergine halves to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!), cut-side up and put in the oven for 20-25 min or until slightly charred

### Step 2

While the aubergine is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop into small bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil and boil a kettle

Once hot, add the diced onion, diced pepper, chopped courgette and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-10 min, stirring frequently, or until beginning to soften

Once softened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside – these are your softened vegetables

### Step 4

Heat a medium, dry pot over a medium heat, once hot, add your cumin seeds and toast for 1-2 min or until fragrant (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!)

Once fragrant, transfer the toasted cumin seeds to a small heat proof bowl (reserve the pot!)

Add your sweet pepper relish and harissa paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [8 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and mix it all together – this is your spiced pepper relish

Cook for 8 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain

### Step 6

While the couscous is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Crumble your feta into rough bite-sized pieces

### Step 7

Add your flaked almonds to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Add the drained couscous to the softened vegetables with half the chopped herbs (you'll use the rest later!) and vegetable stock mix and mix it all together – this is your veg-packed giant couscous

### Step 8

Serve the roasted aubergine on top of the veg-packed giant couscous

Top with the remaining chopped herbs, crumbled feta, spiced pepper relish and toasted almonds

Enjoy!
