### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle and chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until slightly softened

### Step 3

Drain your king prawns

Once softened, add the king prawns and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Add the sliced garlic and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the pan with the prawns and tomatoes and cook for 30 secs

Remove the pan from the heat, then add approx. 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water

Tip: Be careful when adding the water to the pan, it may splash!

Return the pan to the heat, then sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and tear your parsley into the pan and stir it all together

### Step 7

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the spicy king prawn & cherry tomato spaghetti

Sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
