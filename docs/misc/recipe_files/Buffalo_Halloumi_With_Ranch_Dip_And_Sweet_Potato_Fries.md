## Ingredients

- Chives (5g)
- Halloumi (200g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Garlic clove
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- Cider vinegar (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Sweet potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your sweet potato[es] into fries


### Step 2

Add the sweet potato fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the fries are cooking, cut your halloumi into 4 slices per person


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side, or until nicely golden and crisp

Once done, transfer the golden halloumi to kitchen paper


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a pot with 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter on a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir everything together until it combines and becomes a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper, then slice<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Chop your chives finely, then peel and grate your garlic

Combine your natural yoghurt, Dijon mustard, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and chopped chives in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch dip


### Step 7

Return the buffalo sauce pot to a medium heat

Once hot, add the golden halloumi and toss until the halloumi is fully coated in the sauce – this is your buffalo halloumi

### Step 8

Serve the buffalo halloumi with the sweet potato fries, ranch dip and lettuce wedges to the side

Enjoy!
