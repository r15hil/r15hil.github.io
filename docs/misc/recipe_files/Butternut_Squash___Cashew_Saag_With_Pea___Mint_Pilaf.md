## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and golden


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and a generous pinch of your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) your ginger


### Step 4

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 5

Add the wilted spinach and chopped onion to a food processor with the peeled ginger, garlic, a generous pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Add the remaining curry powder, creamed coconut and most of the coriander (reserve a few leaves for a garnish!), then blitz until smooth – this is your saag paste

Tip: Add a splash of water if its looking a little dry!


### Step 6

Reboil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a small knob of butter

Once melted, add your tomato paste with the saag paste and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and cashew nuts and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the roast butternut squash – this is your saag butternut squash & cashew curry

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Once the rice is cooked, add your blanched peas with the chopped mint, sultanas and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your pea & mint pilaf

### Step 8

Serve the saag butternut squash & cashew curry with the pea & mint pilaf to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
