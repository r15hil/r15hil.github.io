## Ingredients

- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Sea bass fillet x0
- Sea bass fillets (2pcs)
- Spring onion x2
- Medium egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- Garlic clove x3
- Soy sauce (30ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml) x0
- Pak choi (200g)
- Honey (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Wash, then chop the roots from your pak choi and separate the leaves, discarding the roots

Chop any larger leaves in half


### Step 2

Add your egg noodles and pak choi to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until the noodles are cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season the skin with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the sea bass, skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Transfer the cooked sea bass to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> flour in a measuring jug and mix until fully combined


### Step 6

Add your honey, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar to the measuring jug and stir it all together – this is your Szechuan-style sauce

Add the Szechuan-style sauce to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling, cook for 1-2 minutes or until thickened


### Step 7

Once your sauce has thickened, add the drained noodles to the pan with half the sliced spring onion (you’ll use the rest later!) and the wilted pak choi and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles and pak choi are warmed through

Season with a generous grind of pepper – these are your Szechuan-style noodles


### Step 8

Serve the Szechuan-style noodles with the sea bass to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
