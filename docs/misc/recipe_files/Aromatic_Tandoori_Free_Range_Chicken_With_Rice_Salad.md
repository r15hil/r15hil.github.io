### Step 1

Pre-heat the grill to a high heat then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then rinse the rice under cold running water until cool and set aside until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your free range chicken breast portions into strips

Combine your curry powder, half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a very generous pinch of salt in a bowl

Add the chicken strips and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken

### Step 3

Drizzle a baking tray with vegetable oil (to prevent the chicken from sticking)

Add the coated chicken to the tray and put it under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through and starting to char (no pink meat!) – this is your free range tandoori chicken

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the remaining natural yoghurt and mayo to a small bowl

Zest your lime[s]

Peel and finely grate (or chop) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), lime zest and a generous pinch of both salt and pepper to the yoghurt – this is your lime & garlic yoghurt

### Step 5

Slice the cucumber halves finely

### Step 7

Add the rinsed rice, chopped cucumber, shredded red cabbage and your nigella seeds to a bowl

Squeeze the juice of the lime[s] into the bowl and season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the free range tandoori chicken over the rice salad

Drizzle the lime & garlic yoghurt all over and garnish with the chopped mint & coriander

Enjoy!
