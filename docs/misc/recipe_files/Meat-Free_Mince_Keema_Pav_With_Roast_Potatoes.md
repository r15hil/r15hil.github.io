### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray

Drizzle with vegetable oil, add the ground turmeric with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp and cooked through – these are your turmeric roast potatoes

### Step 3

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

While the onion softens, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic with the ground cumin, ground coriander and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Add the plant-based mince (remove the paper if required!), increase the heat to high and cook for a further 4-5 min or until it's starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle
