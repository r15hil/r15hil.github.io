This staple of Milan inspired the famous ‘wiener schnitzel’ of neighbouring Austria, where meat is battered down, breaded and fried. Our British rump steaks are tender and the perfect cut, which you'll serve alongside a piquant balsamic tomato salad and buttery potatoes.

### Step 3

Trim the fat off the rump steaks


Cover the steaks in <span class="text-highlight">cling film</span> and bash them with a rolling pin until flat and approx. half a cm in thickness


Tip: This will make the meat really tender!

### Step 4

Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork


Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate with the dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper<span class="text-highlight"> – these are your herby breadcrumbs</span>

### Step 5

Coat the steaks in the flour, tap off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg and press it into the <span class="text-highlight">herby</span> breadcrumbs firmly to coat everything evenly


Tip: Make sure the steaks are fully coated in the breadcrumbs!

### Step 6

Return the drained potatoes to the pot with a knob of butter and season generously with salt and pepper – these are your buttered potatoes


Pick the basil leaves from the stalks and stir through the marinated tomatoes – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once very hot, add the coated steaks and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden brown


Once done, transfer to a cooling rack (you can use the rack from your grill) to rest and season with a pinch of salt – this is your Milanese rump steak

### Step 8

Serve the Milanese rump steak with the buttered potatoes and tomato salsa to the side
