### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4 and boil a kettle

Peel and cut the waxy potatoes into small, bite-sized pieces

Add them to a pot, cover with boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring back to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-15 min until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 3

Pat the hake fillets dry with kitchen paper and add them to a tin foil-lined baking tray with the halved cherry tomatoes

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the garlic

Chop the parsley and basil roughly, including the stalks

Slice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half and cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wedges and set them aside for serving

### Step 5

Add the chopped garlic, parsley and basil to a pestle & mortar and grind to a coarse paste

Grate the cheddar cheese directly into the mortar and continue to grind together to make a paste

Drizzle over enough olive oil to loosen the mix, then add a squeeze of lemon juice and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pesto

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!

### Step 6

Drain the cooked potatoes and leave them to steam-dry for 5 min

Tip: This allows the potatoes to dry out, making them perfect for mashing later!

### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to the pot with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> lemon juice, a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon mash

### Step 8

Serve the hake fillets over the lemon mash with the cherry tomatoes to the side

Drizzle a little pesto over the fish and serve the rest to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
