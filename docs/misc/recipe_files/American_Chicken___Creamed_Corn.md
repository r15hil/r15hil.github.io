## Description

Creamed corn is something we're a little unfamiliar with in Blighty. It's a creamy sweetcorn that partners perfectly with our hot, spiced shredded chicken and sweet potato fries. Totally American, totally delicious!

## Ingredients

- 1 tin of sweetcorn 
- 1 tsp Italian dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp spicy cayenne pepper
- 400g sweet potatoes
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 1 shallot
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the sweet potatoes (skins on) into thin chips&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Add the chips to&nbsp;a large baking tray, sprinkle with the cornflour and drizzle with&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;


Tip: the cornflour helps the chips crisp up!


Give everything a good old mix up (use clean hands)


Put the tray in the oven&nbsp;for 20 min or until the chips&nbsp;are tender and starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the chicken&nbsp;breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to a bowl with the&nbsp;smoked paprika, dried oregano, cayenne pepper&nbsp;(can't handle the heat? Go easy!)&nbsp;and plenty&nbsp;of salt&nbsp;


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a lid, with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium heat and cook for 2-3 min on each side


Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> water to the pan, cover and cook for 10-12 min&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Trim and slice the spring onions finely


Peel and chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 5

Meanwhile, melt a large knob of&nbsp;butter in a pot over a medium heat&nbsp;


Once melted, add the chopped&nbsp;shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until soft


Drain the sweetcorn and add it to the softened shallot


Add the clotted cream and cook for 1 min


Season generously with both salt and pepper&nbsp;


### Step 6

Add&nbsp;the sweetcorn to a&nbsp;food processor&nbsp;and blitz to a coarse&nbsp;pur&eacute;e&nbsp;- this is your creamed corn


Return the creamed corn back to the pot and set aside&nbsp;


### Step 7

Remove the lid from the chicken pan and continue to cook the chicken until the liquid has reduced to a sticky consistency, approx. 3-5 min


Use two forks to pull&nbsp;the cooked chicken into shreds, then mix with the pan juices


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the shredded chicken over the creamed corn with the sweet potato chips to the side&nbsp;


Garnish with the chopped spring onion


Enjoy!
