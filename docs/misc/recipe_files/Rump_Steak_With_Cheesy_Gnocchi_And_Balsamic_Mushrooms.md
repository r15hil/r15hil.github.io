- British rump pavé steak (150g) x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Gnocchi (350g)
- Chestnut mushrooms (160g)
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g) x0

- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary, and if you like your steak well-done, it may take you a little longer than 10 min


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with salt on both sides

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and once very hot add the steak[s]

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Once the steak is done, transfer to a plate and set aside to rest

Return the pan to a medium-high heat and add your gnocchi with a generous knob of butter and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have softened, add your balsamic vinegar and cook for 1-2 min further or until evaporated

Once the balsamic vinegar has evaporated, remove the pan from the heat and add your spinach, mix it all together and set aside until slightly wilted – this is your balsamic mushrooms & spinach


### Step 7

Add your grated Italian hard cheese to the gnocchi and gently stir it all together – this is your cheesy gnocchi

### Step 8

Pour any resting juices from the steak into the balsamic mushrooms & spinach

Serve the rested steak with the cheesy gnocchi and balsamic mushrooms & spinach to the side

Enjoy!
