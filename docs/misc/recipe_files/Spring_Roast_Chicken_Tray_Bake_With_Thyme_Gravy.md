## Ingredients

- 0 British skin-on chicken thighs
- 14g gravy base
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 320g British skin on chicken thighs
- 1 leek
- 125g radishes
- 1 brown onion
- 4 white potatoes

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Top, tail and chop your radishes in half

Top, tail and chop your leek[s] into rounds, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit


### Step 3

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Grate your Italian hard cheese finely


### Step 4

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper

Add the chopped potatoes and halved radishes to the baking tray[s] with the chopped leek, onion wedges and a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 5

Season with half your dried thyme (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper then add, skin side up, to the baking tray[s], nestled amongst the vegetables

Top the chicken with the grated cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until the veg is roasted and tender and the chicken is cooked through and golden (no pink meat!) – this is your spring roast chicken tray bake


### Step 7

When the tray bake is almost ready, boil half a kettle

Combine your gravy base with the remaining dried thyme and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>boiled water, whisk thoroughly

Put it in the microwave and cook for 30-40 secs or until thickened and give everything a good mix up – this is your thyme gravy

### Step 8

Enjoy!
