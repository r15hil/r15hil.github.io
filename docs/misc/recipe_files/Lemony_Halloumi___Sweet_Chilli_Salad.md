## Description

We love halloumi - it's a big, mighty cheesy steak, especially when you cook it this way. You'll boil it to remove some of its saltiness and then roll it out into a steak and pan fry until golden. Served over a pea shoot, carrot, courgette and bulgur salad with a chilli-lemon dressing for kick.

## Ingredients

- 1 courgette
- 25g fresh chilli jam
- 100g carrots
- 50g pea shoots 
- 225g Cypriot halloumi 
- 1 lemon
- 75g pilavlik bulgur

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Add the bulgur to a pot with plenty of boiled water (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice the halloumi in half lengthways (where the natural crease forms)


Add 500ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]&nbsp;</span>boiled water to&nbsp;a pot and return to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, carefully add the halloumi slices and boil for 5-8 min or until they've softened&nbsp;


### Step 3

Cut&nbsp;the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in half


Combine the chilli jam with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and stir until the jam has dissolved


Add the juice of half the lemon and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil - this is your sweet chilli dressing


Top and tail and cut the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


### Step 4

Once softened, drain and pat the halloumi slices dry with a clean tea towel or kitchen paper


Using&nbsp;a rolling pin, flatten and roll out each piece until they are a little larger than a post-it note&nbsp;


### Step 5

Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the courgette with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until golden&nbsp;


Once golden, transfer the courgette to a small plate and keep the pan for step 7


### Step 6

Top, tail and peel&nbsp;the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Chop&nbsp;the pea shoots roughly


### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat and once hot, add the halloumi slices &nbsp;


Cook each side for 1-2 min or until golden


Meanwhile, combine the bulgur wheat, carrot ribbons, pea shoots and courgette in a large salad bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon and mix to combine&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the golden halloumi over the salad and drizzle the chilli lemon dressing over&nbsp;


Garnish with the remaining lemon, cut into wedges


Enjoy!
