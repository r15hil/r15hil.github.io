## Ingredients

- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Seasonal salad (50g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Sweet potato x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Broccoli
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Pierce your sweet potato[es] with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 6-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the softened sweet potato[es] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until they are cooked through


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your broccoli into small florets and chop the stem[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the broccoli florets and stem[s] to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once done, drain, return to the pot and keep covered


### Step 3

Whilst the broccoli is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 4

Once softened, add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter with 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour to the pan with the garlic and onion and stir with a wooden spoon for 3-4 min or until the butter melts and a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a baking tray with your dried oregano, a sprinkle of grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!), a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby panko

Put the herby panko in the oven for 5-6 min or until golden

Tip: Watch this like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!


### Step 6

Grate your cheddar cheese into the béchamel sauce, then add your Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season generously with salt and pepper, then add the cooked broccoli to the sauce and mix everything together – this is your broccoli cheese


### Step 7

Once done, remove the baked sweet potato[es] from the oven and slice down the middle, leaving the ends intact

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the broccoli cheese over the baked sweet potato with the dressed salad to the side – these are your broccoli cheese-loaded baked sweet potato

Sprinkle the herby panko and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over the broccoli cheese-loaded baked sweet potato

Enjoy!
