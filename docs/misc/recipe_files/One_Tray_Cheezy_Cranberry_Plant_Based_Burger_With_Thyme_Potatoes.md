## Ingredients

- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Cheese flavour slices (2pcs)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Dried cranberries (30g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/gas 7

Boil half a kettle and chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your meat-free patty[ies] to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Sprinkle half your dried thyme (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of pepper on the burger[s]

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 3

Once your potatoes are fork-tender, add a knob of butter, the remaining dried thyme, and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your thyme potatoes


### Step 4

Add the thyme potatoes to the baking tray[s] with the burger[s] and reserve the bowl

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the burger[s] are cooked through and the potatoes are golden and crispy


### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, chop your dried cranberries roughly

Add the chopped dried cranberries to the reserved bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften


### Step 6

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are tender and crisp and the burger[s] cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Drain the soaked cranberries, discarding the soaking liquid

Top your meat-free patty[ies] with the soaked cranberries and a cheese flavour slice

Add your brioche halves to the baking tray[s], cut side up, and return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until warmed through and golden

### Step 8

To build your burger, divide your mayo between each warmed brioche base, top with some salad and a meat-free patty[ies] and then top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your cheezy cranberry plant-based burger

Serve the thyme potatoes and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a small drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
