## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a generous pinch of salt and cook for an initial 7 min, turning half way, or until starting to brown


### Step 3

While the chicken is browning, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook your orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite


### Step 4

Meanwhile, finely chop or grate your garlic

Wash your spinach


### Step 5

Once your orecchiette is cooked with a slight bite, add your spinach to the pot and cook for a further 20-30 secs or until wilted

Once wilted, drain the orecchiette and spinach, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your balsamic sundried tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soft cheese, chicken stock mix and half of your Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[260ml]</span> starchy pasta water

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce is starting to thicken and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained orecchiette and spinach and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your Tuscan-style chicken breast sauce with fresh orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the Tuscan-style chicken breast sauce with fresh orecchiette and top with the remaining Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
