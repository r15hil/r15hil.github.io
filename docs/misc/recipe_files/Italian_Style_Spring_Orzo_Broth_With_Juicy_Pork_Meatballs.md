## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 100g orzo pasta
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 British barn egg
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 carrot
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 250g British pork mince
- 5g parsley
- 150g spring greens
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Combine the pork mince and egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a bowl with the panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!) and shape into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> meatballs – these are your pork meatballs


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork meatballs to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate (these will finish cooking in the broth later!)


### Step 3

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Wash, the spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 4

Heat a large pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and Chinese rice wine to the pan with the dried oregano and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the orzo pasta and 900ml <span class="text-danger">[1.8L] </span>boiled water to the pot with the chicken stock mix and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to medium-high


### Step 6

Add the shredded spring greens and pork meatballs to the pot

Cook for 12-15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the orzo is cooked with a slight bite

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking


### Step 7

Once the meatballs are cooked through, remove the pot from the heat and stir through half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a knob of butter – this is your Italian-style spring orzo broth with juicy pork meatballs

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the Italian-style spring orzo broth with juicy pork meatballs in bowls

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, chopped parsley and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
