## Ingredients

- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Spring onion
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- Jerk paste (24g)
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Tomato ketchup (30ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Combine half your jerk paste (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with half your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your jerk marinade

Add your free range chicken thighs and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Once the chicken is lightly browned, transfer the browned chicken to an oven-proof dish and pour over any excess marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 12-14 min or until cooked through and slightly charred (no pink meat!) – this is your roasted jerk chicken


### Step 5

Combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and your mayo in a bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your slaw


### Step 6

Combine your ketchup and the remaining jerk paste in a clean large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your jerk glaze


### Step 7

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Once the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through, add the roasted jerk chicken (and any chicken juices!) to the bowl with the jerk glaze

Give it a good mix up – this is your glazed jerk-spiced free range chicken thighs

### Step 8

Serve the glazed jerk-spiced free range chicken thighs with the slaw and sweet potato wedges to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
