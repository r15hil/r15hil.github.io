## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Meanwhile, wash your pak choi and slice into quarters lengthways, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then set the browned chicken aside


### Step 5

Add your white long grain rice to the casserole dish with your ginger & garlic paste, Chinese rice wine, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and the juice of half your lime[s]

Add your chicken stock mix and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, give everything a good mix up until the rice is fully coated


### Step 6

Put the browned chicken on top and put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 25 min


### Step 7

Once the chicken has had 25 min, top the dish with the pak choi quarters

Return the dish to the oven, covered, for a further 5 min or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one-pot Hainanese-style chicken & rice with pak choi

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot Hainanese-style chicken & rice with pak choi in the middle of the table

Garnish with a lime wedge, your crispy onions and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Dig in!
