### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice half you<span class="text-danger"> </span>brown onion, then finely slice the remaining onion

### Step 2

Add your Fable pulled mushrooms to an oven-proof dish

Sprinkle over your ground cumin and ground smoked paprika with 2/3 of your cider vinegar and half your agave (you'll use the rest later!)

Pour in 100ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> [180ml]</span> boiled water with half your vegetable stock mix (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up, then put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the mushrooms are slightly crispy

### Step 3

While the mushrooms are in the oven, add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite and once done, drain and set aside

While the macaroni is cooking, melt 15g <span class="text-purple">[22g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter in a pan over a medium heat

Reboil half a kettle and grate your cheddar flavour block[s]

### Step 4

Once melted, add the diced onion and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[22g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the onion – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> [600ml]</span> milk into the roux and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

### Step 5

Stir through half the grated cheeze with half your mustard ketchup (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your béchamel sauce

Add the drained macaroni to the béchamel sauce with a grind of pepper and a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Transfer the cheezy macaroni to an oven-proof dish, reserving the pan (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with the remaining grated cheeze and half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1650990904130-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your spicy mac 'n' cheeze

While everything's in the oven, wipe down the reserved pan and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and remaining chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Wash your shredded spring greens, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1650990907865-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the onion has softened, add the shredded spring greens to the pan with the remaining vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until wilted – these are your collard-style greens

Meanwhile, combine the remaining mustard ketchup, remaining agave, remaining cider vinegar, remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and your smoked sea salt flakes – this is your Carolina-style gold sauce

### Step 8

Pull the mushrooms apart using two forks and mix everything through the seasoning – these are your pulled fable mushrooms

Serve the collard-style greens in a bowl with the spicy mac 'n' cheeze and pulled fable mushrooms to the side

Drizzle the Carolina-style gold sauce over the mushrooms

Enjoy!
