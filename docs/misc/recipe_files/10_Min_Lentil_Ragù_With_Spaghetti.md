Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over the highest heat

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Trim, then chop the spring onions roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed!)


### Step 3

Once hot, add the chopped spring onions and grated carrot to the pan

Tear the chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the quick cook spaghetti for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the quick cook spaghetti and return it to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 5

While the spaghetti is cooking, drain and rinse the lentils


### Step 6

Add the roasted garlic paste and dried oregano to the pan and cook for 30 secs


### Step 7

Crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube

Add the tomato frito, tomato paste and drained lentils with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> water and the Marmite and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened

Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper – this is your lentil ragù

### Step 8
