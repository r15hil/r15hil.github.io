### Step 6

Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Once the meatballs have been cooking for 10-15 min, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the wholewheat spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the wholewheat spaghetti

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!), remove the dish from the oven and top with the spinach

Return the dish to the oven and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has started to wilt

Mix it all together – these are your pork & beef meatballs with tomato sauce

### Step 8

Serve the pork & beef meatballs with tomato sauce over the drained wholewheat spaghetti

Grate your cheddar cheese over the top and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
