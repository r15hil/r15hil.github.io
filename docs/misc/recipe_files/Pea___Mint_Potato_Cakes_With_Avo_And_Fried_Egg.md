## Ingredients

- 4 white potatoes
- 1 avocado
- 160g blanched peas
- 5g chives
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 10g mint
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, trim, then finely slice the spring onions

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 3

Once the potatoes are done, drain them and return to the pot to steam dry

Mash the potatoes until smooth

Add the blanched peas, sliced spring onion, chopped mint and 1/4 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1/2 tsp]</span> salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your pea & mint potato mixture


### Step 4

Shape the pea & mint potato mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> cakes

Add the pea & mint potato cakes to a lightly oiled baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden

Tip: If the potato cake mix is a little wet and not sticking together nicely, add a spoonful or two of flour


### Step 5

While the potato cakes are cooking, add the white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your dressing

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, add it to the dressing and give it a gentle mix up


### Step 6

Chop the chives finely

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways

Season with a small pinch of salt


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan and season with a pinch of salt

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 8

Serve the pea & mint potato cakes with the avocado and dressed baby leaf salad to the side

Top with a fried egg and garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!
