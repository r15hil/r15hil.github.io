### Step 3

Finely dice the remaining red onion[s]

Finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!) and juice your lime[s]

Core and slice your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into matchsticks

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt then cook over a medium heat for 3-4 min or until softened

Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy), chopped garlic and lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!)

Season with salt and pepper and cook for 5-7 min until crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Once the black beans have softened, add a small knob of butter to the pot and mash them to a coarse paste – these are your refried beans

Drain the quick-pickled red onion, discard the liquid

### Step 8

Layer up the warmed tortillas with the lean pork and refried beans

Garnish the assembled tacos with the zesty apple slaw and quick-pickled red onion

Enjoy!
