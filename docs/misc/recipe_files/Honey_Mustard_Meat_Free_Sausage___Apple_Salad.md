## Ingredients

- 6 Taste & Glory meat free sausages
- 2 ciabattas
- 15ml cider vinegar
- 21g wholegrain mustard
- 1 apple
- 25g honey
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the red onions into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker!)


### Step 2

Add the onion wedges and meat-free sausages to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Drizzle the onion wedges with olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the sausages are cooked through and the onions are tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine the wholegrain mustard, honey and cider vinegar with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your honey mustard dressing


### Step 4

Rip the ciabattas into bite-sized pieces and add them to a separate baking tray

Drizzle them very generously with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 6-8 min or until golden and crispy – these are your croutons


### Step 5

While the croutons are in the oven, cut the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skins on) into matchsticks


### Step 6

Once the onion wedges are done, carefully cut off the root and remove the skins

Wash the lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the lettuce, apple matchsticks, croutons, roasted red onion and most of the honey mustard dressing (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl

Stir it all together – this is your honey mustard & apple salad


### Step 7

Once cooked, cut the meat-free sausages in half lengthways

### Step 8

Serve the halved meat-free sausages over the honey mustard & apple salad

Drizzle with the remaining honey mustard dressing

Enjoy!
