## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice, star anise and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant rice


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 6-8 min or until soft


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped tomato and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add your ground paprika, curry powder and drained chickpeas to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 6

Add the coconut stock and mango chutney to the pan and cook for 6-7 min further or until it's thickened in consistency – this is your chickpea tikka masala


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the chickpea tikka masala with the fragrant rice to the side (discard the star anise!)

Sprinkle over your flaked almonds and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
