## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 courgette
- 10g parsley & mint
- 250g British beef mince
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 1 tbsp baharat
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a pot with a lid over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min or until golden, then transfer to a small bowl and set aside, reserve the pot with the oil


### Step 2

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways, then chop into small bite-sized pieces

Grate 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>brown onion and slice the remaining onion finely


### Step 3

Add the grated onion, beef mince, baharat, half of the cumin and a generous pinch of salt to a large bowl – this is your beef mix

Knead the beef mix thoroughly with clean hands for 2-3 min (this helps the mixture hold together when cooking), then shape into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12] </span>koftas

Add the koftas to one side of a lightly oiled baking tray


### Step 4

Add the chopped pepper, chopped courgette and the remaining chopped garlic to the other side of the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Meanwhile dissolve the chicken stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Tip: Add a splash of oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Add the ground allspice, ground cinnamon and remaining cumin and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant, then add the bulgur wheat and chicken stock and cook, covered, for 5-7 min or until the water has absorbed and the bulgur is cooked with a bite


### Step 6

While the bulgur is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish!)

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Once the bulgur is done, remove the pot from the heat and fluff with a fork


### Step 7

Add the natural yoghurt to the bowl with the golden garlic and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix to combine – this is your garlic yoghurt

Add the roasted pepper & courgette to the fluffed bulgur with the chopped parsley and chopped mint – this is your roasted veg bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the roasted veg bulgur and dollop the garlic yoghurt over the top

Top with the beef koftas and garnish with the reserved parsley leaves

Enjoy!
