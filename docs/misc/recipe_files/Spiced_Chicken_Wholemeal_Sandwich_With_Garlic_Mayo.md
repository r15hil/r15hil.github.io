## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 1 gem lettuce
- 2 wholemeal rolls
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray, drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season with the dried oregano, salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby potatoes


### Step 3

Add the chicken breast portions to a plate with the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season generously with salt and pepper

Refrigerate until later


### Step 4

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the sliced spring onion to a small bowl with the mayo, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), white wine vinegar, salt, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Add the wholemeal rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Carefully slice them in half before serving


### Step 7

Wash and shred the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Assemble your sandwiches with the cooked spiced chicken, a dollop of garlic mayo and shredded lettuce

Serve the herby potatoes to the side with the remaining lettuce and drizzle over the remaining garlic mayo

Enjoy!
