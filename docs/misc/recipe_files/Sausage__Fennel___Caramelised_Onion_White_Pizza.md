## Description

This do-it-yourself twist on takeaway pizza is all you knead. You’ll smother pizza dough with cheesy, garlicky white sauce before scattering over sausage. Pop it in the oven and top it with sweet balsamic-glazed caramelised onion to serve.

## Ingredients

- 1 tomato
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 7g dried yeast
- 50g soft cheese
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 150g sausage meat
- 250g pizza base mix
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 25g honey
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add the dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt to the pan, then reduce the heat to low

Cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, peel and chop (or grate!) the garlic

Combine the chopped garlic and soft cheese in a separate bowl with half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!), a splash of milk and a generous grind of black pepper

Stir it all together – this is your white sauce


### Step 4

Add the pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast mixture

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)


### Step 5

Press each dough ball in the centre and push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is approx. 18-20cm in diameter – these are your pizza bases

Remove the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven (careful the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> will be hot!)


### Step 6

Transfer the pizza bases to the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then spread the white sauce over the bases

Tear over the sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) in very small pieces, then top with the fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Drizzle the crusts with a little olive oil, then put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until the crust has puffed up and browned and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

While the pizzas are cooking, slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

Wash the baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad and tomato rounds to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad

Once the onion is caramelised, add the balsamic vinegar and honey and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce is sticky and glossy – this is your balsamic-glazed onion

### Step 8

Top the pizzas with the balsamic-glazed onion – these are your sausage, fennel & caramelised onion white pizzas

Drizzle over any remaining glaze from the pan

Serve the salad to the side

Enjoy!
