### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7 and boil a kettle


Peel and halve the potatoes, then add them to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10 min or until fork-tender


Once done, drain, return them to the pot with the polenta and shake them until they're fluffy and fully coated

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the parsnips into batons


Tip: Keep the parsnip tips thick to stop them from burning!


Trim and halve the Chantenay carrots (no need to peel!)


Trim the ends from the Brussels sprouts


Add the chopped carrots and parsnips (save the sprouts for later!) to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and set aside for later

### Step 3

Add the turkey joint to one side of a baking tray and top with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper


Add the polenta coated potatoes to the other side of the tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

### Step 4

Put both trays in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the vegetables have caramelised and the potatoes are starting to brown


Tip: Put the potatoes on the top shelf of your oven for extra crispiness!


Whilst the turkey is in the oven, combine the honey and wholegrain mustard in a bowl – this is your honey mustard glaze


Re-boil a kettle

### Step 5

Wipe the pot clean and return it to a medium heat with a large knob of butter


Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste


Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Kallo chicken stock cube in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and add to the pan with the Marmite and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your Marmite gravy

### Step 6

Once the turkey has had 15 min, add the pigs in blankets to the turkey tray


Push the carrots and parsnips to the side of the other tray and add the Brussels sprouts with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt


Drizzle the carrots and parsnips with the honey mustard glaze and return both trays to the oven for an initial 15 mins or until the turkey is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Once the turkey is done, remove it from the oven and set it aside to rest


Remove the vegetables from the oven and cover in tin foil to keep warm until serving


Return the potatoes and pigs in blankets to the oven and cook for 8-10 min further, or until they're cooked through (remember, no pink meat!) and the potatoes are golden and crispy

### Step 8

Once rested, slice the cooked turkey


Serve the sliced turkey with the pigs in blankets, roasted potatoes, honey mustard glazed vegetables, roasted Brussels sprouts and cranberry sauce to the side


Drizzle the Marmite gravy over everything


Enjoy!
