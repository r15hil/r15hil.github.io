## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel your potato[es] and chop them into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Whilst the onion is softening, dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan with your curry powder and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped potato and carrot with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add the tomato stock with the tomato wedges and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 20-25 min or until the potatoes and carrots are tender, stirring occasionally – these are your curried vegetables

Whilst everything is cooking, line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper


### Step 6

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your pie lids


### Step 7

Once the veg is tender, stir through your blanched peas and cook for a further 1 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the curried vegetables topped with a pie lid

Enjoy!
