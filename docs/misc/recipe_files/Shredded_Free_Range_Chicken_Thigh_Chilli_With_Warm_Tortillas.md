- Cannellini beans (185g) x2
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp) x2
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Coriander (5g)
- Tomato paste (32g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet to let it and let it air

Add your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until combined

Add your free range chicken thighs to the plate and turn them several times until evenly coated in all the spices


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs and any remaining spices and cook for 2 min on each side until browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your<span class="text-danger"> </span>chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> [375ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 5

Add the drained cannellini beans, tomato stock and chicken thighs to an oven-proof dish and put the dish in the oven for 25-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, fold your tortillas in half and add them to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Transfer the cooked chicken thighs to a clean board and shred them apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the shredded chicken to the dish and give everything a good mix up – this is your shredded free range chicken chilli

### Step 8

Serve the shredded free range chicken chilli with the warmed tortillas

Dollop with your natural yoghurt, grate your cheddar cheese all over and garnish with some coriander leaves

Enjoy!
