## Ingredients

- 2 wholewheat noodle nests
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 40g black bean paste
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 80g spinach

- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Deseed the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic


### Step 3

Add the wheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min


### Step 4

While the noodles are soaking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced yellow pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened


### Step 5

Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, drain the softened wheat noodles, reserving 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>starchy noodle water


### Step 6

Drain the king prawns

Once fragrant, add the king prawns with the black bean paste, Chinese rice wine and starchy noodle water

Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened


### Step 7

Wash the spinach

Add the drained wheat noodles to the pan with the spinach and cover with a lid for 1-2 min or until the spinach starts to wilt

Once slightly wilted, give everything a good mix up â€“ this is your saucy prawn & pepper black bean stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the saucy prawn & pepper black bean stir-fry in bowls

Garnish with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
