### Step 2

While the noodles are softening, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim, then chop the spring onions<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

### Step 3

Combine half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>white miso paste with the honey and give everything a good mix up – this is your miso honey glaze

Combine the remaining white miso paste with the rice vinegar and half the toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your miso dressing

Wash then cut the pak choi into halves, lengthways, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Preheat the grill to medium-high

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chopped garlic, ginger and spring onion with half the chopped red chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until softened and fragrant

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the pak choi halves (flat side up) to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Spread the miso honey glaze equally over the white bases

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray under the grill for 5 min or until the pak choi has begun to char and the glaze has caramelised

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Add the softened noodles and spinach to the pan with a small splash of water, mix everything together and cook, covered for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted

Push the noodles to one side of the pan and crack the eggs into the other side

Stir the eggs with a wooden spoon to break the yolks and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the noodles

### Step 7

Remove the noodles from the heat and add the remaining toasted sesame oil and tamari soy sauce and stir everything together until the noodles are fully coated – these are your egg fried rice noodles

### Step 8

Serve the egg fried rice noodles on plates with the miso glazed pak choi to the side

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the pak choi

Drizzle over the miso dressing and garnish with the remaining red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
