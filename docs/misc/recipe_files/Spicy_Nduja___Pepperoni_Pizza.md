## Ingredients

-  'Nduja (40g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Sliced pepperoni (30g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic, dried oregano and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato base


### Step 3

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the tomato base between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon


### Step 5

Top the pizza[s] with your sliced pepperoni and sliced 'Nduja

Evenly sprinkle over the torn mozzarella and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-17 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – this is your spicy 'Nduja & pepperoni pizza


### Step 6

While the pizza is in the oven, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with a pinch of salt and black pepper – this is your balsamic dressing


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and drizzle over the balsamic dressing

Mix it all together – this is your balsamic salad

### Step 8

Serve the spicy 'Nduja & pepperoni pizza with the balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!
