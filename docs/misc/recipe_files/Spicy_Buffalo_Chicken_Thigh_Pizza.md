### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, once hot, add the diced chicken thigh and cook for an initial 4-5 min on each side or until golden

### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the sriracha, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), Henderson's Relish and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your buffalo sauce

### Step 3

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Grate the cheddar cheese
