## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips


### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

On a separate board, chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and the chopped chicken with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken has browned and the onion is starting to soften


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Heat a pot with a lid with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once melted, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1 min or until starting to sizzle

Once sizzling, add your basmati rice, stirring to coat the grains in the butter and oil


### Step 5

Once the grains are coated, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your jeera rice


### Step 6

Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced pepper and tomato wedges and cook for 4-5 min further or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, your curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken jalfrezi

### Step 8

Serve the chicken jalfrezi over the jeera rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
