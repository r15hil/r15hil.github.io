### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced peppers and onion with a generous splash of cold water and cook for 15 min or until starting to caramelise

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it from burning

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil a kettle
