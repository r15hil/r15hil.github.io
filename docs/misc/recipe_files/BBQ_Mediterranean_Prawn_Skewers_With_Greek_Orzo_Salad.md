- Raw peeled king prawns (85g) x0
- Feta (30g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove x2
- Skewers x4
- Tomato
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Orzo (100g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic to a large bowl with your dried oregano, the juice of half your lemon[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic, lemon & herb marinade


### Step 2

Add your king prawns to the garlic, lemon & herb marinade and give everything a good mix up and set aside – these are your marinated prawns


### Step 3

Add your orzo pasta to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and rinse under cold running water until cooled

Drain the orzo thoroughly, then return it to the pot with a small drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon juice and mix it all up


### Step 4

While the orzo is cooking, cut your cucumber in half and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, discard the watery seeds, then dice the cucumber finely

Dice your tomato[es] 

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Chop your black olives roughly


### Step 5

Thread the marinated prawns onto the soaked skewers


### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the prawn skewers to the pan with any remaining garlic, lemon & herb marinade

Cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your Mediterranean prawn skewers


### Step 7

Mix the diced cucumber, chopped olives, sliced shallot and diced tomato with the orzo – this is your Greek orzo salad

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the Mediterranean prawn skewers with the Greek orzo salad and salad to the side

Crumble your feta over the Greek orzo salad, and squeeze any remaining lemon juice over the salad

Season everything with a grind of black pepper and enjoy!
