### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

### Step 2

Once starting to soften, increase the heat to high, then add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion is caramelised

Once cooked, remove from the heat set aside – this is your cooked chicken thigh and caramelised onion

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a large pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once cooked, drain the farfalle, reserving<span class="text-danger"> </span>a cup of the starchy pasta water and reserve the pot

### Step 5

Return the pot to a medium heat and add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce

### Step 6

Remove the pot from the heat and add your soft cheese, chicken stock mix, grated cheddar cheese and most of your dried basil (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up

Add a large splash of starchy pasta water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your creamy pasta sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1707831309980-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the cooked chicken thigh, cooked farfalle, most of the caramelised onion and the spinach to the creamy pasta sauce and mix it all together

Transfer to an oven-proof dish and top with the remaining caramelised onion, panko breadcrumbs, the remaining dried basil and a drizzle of olive oil

Cook for 12-14 min or until the breadcrumbs are lightly golden – this is your creamy chicken thigh & spinach farfalle bake

### Step 8

Leave the creamy chicken thigh & spinach farfalle bake to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!) then dig in

Enjoy!
