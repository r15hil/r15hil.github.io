### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Add your fennel seeds and sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 4

Add the sliced leek and sliced garlic to the pan with the sausage meat and cook for 4-5 min or until the leek is beginning to soften

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

While the pasta is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your soft cheese – this is your creamy stock

Once the leek is beginning to soften, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add the creamy stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1649234957404-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, stir in the drained portobello mushroom tortelloni with half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!), a splash of starchy pasta water and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your sausage, leek & fennel sauce with mushroom tortelloni

### Step 8

Serve the sausage, leek & fennel sauce with mushroom tortelloni topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
