### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Whilst the chips are in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic to a bowl with your lamb mince and ground cumin and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patty hold its shape whilst cooking), then shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person

Add to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put into the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 4

Add the chopped coriander to a bowl and crumble in your feta

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of pepper and stir it all together – this is your herby feta

### Step 5

Chop your sultanas roughly

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the chopped sultanas and grated carrot to a separate bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy carrot & sultana slaw

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/R2366Step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the ciabatta halves, cut side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 7

Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mayo, a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> water in a small bowl – this is your harissa mayo

### Step 8

Spread a spoonful of harissa mayo onto the warmed ciabatta base, then top with a lamb patty, the herby feta and warmed ciabatta lid – this is your Persian-style lamb burger

Serve with the chips, zingy carrot & sultana slaw and any remaining harissa mayo to the side

Enjoy!
