### Step 3

Once hot, add the pork mince and cook for 6-7 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, until browned and crisp

Once crisp, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 1 min further until fragrant

Once done, add the pork to a plate and cover with tin foil to keep warm – this is your crispy pork

Reserve the pan

Add the pak choi leaves and cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are cooked with slight bite and the pak choi has softened

Once done, drain and set aside

Chop the peanuts roughly
