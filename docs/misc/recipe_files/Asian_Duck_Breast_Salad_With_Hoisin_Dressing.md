### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Using a sharp knife, score the duck skin on a diagonal, being careful not to cut through to the meat


Season with a generous pinch of salt, then add the scored duck, skin-side down, to a cold, dry pan over a low-medium heat


Cook for 10-15 min, skin-side down only, or until the skin is golden and crispy

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

### Step 3

Once golden, transfer the duck, skin-side up, to a baking tray


Put the tray into the oven for 10-12 min for medium


Tip: Cook for 3-5 minutes further if you prefer your duck well done


Once cooked, set the duck aside, cover, and leave to rest for at least 10 min

While the duck is cooking, boil a kettle


Combine the rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce with the chopped ginger, garlic and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and stir it all together – this is your hoisin dressing
