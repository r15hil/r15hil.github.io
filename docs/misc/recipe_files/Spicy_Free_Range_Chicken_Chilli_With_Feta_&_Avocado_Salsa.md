### Step 1

Boil half a kettle, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Add your ground smoked paprika and ground cumin to a plate with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Mix it all up, then add your free range chicken breast portion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and turn until well coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is browning, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Drain and rinse the black beans

### Step 4

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the chipotle stock, drained black beans and your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling, cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Remove the stone[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Crumble your feta into large pieces using your hands

Cut your lime[s] in half

Combine the diced avocado, sliced spring onion and crumbled feta in a small bowl

Add the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime and stir it all together – this is your feta & avocado salsa

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy free range chicken chilli

### Step 8

Serve the spicy free range chicken chilli with the brown rice and feta & avocado salsa to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
