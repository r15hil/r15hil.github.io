- Rice noodles (200g)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp)
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Gluten free soy sauce (15ml)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- Ground turmeric (0.5tsp)

- Cornflour (1tsp) x0
- Plain tofu (280g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your rice noodles to a large bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and set aside

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the tofu pieces to a bowl with your gluten free soy sauce and your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy tofu

Once crispy, set aside and reserve the pan


### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, creamed coconut and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

While the pepper is cooking, wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the pepper has started to soften, add the chopped garlic and ground turmeric to the pan with your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the drained noodles, coconut stock and spinach and give everything a good mix up until the spinach has wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, stir through the crispy tofu to warm through – these are your coconutty curried noodles with crispy tofu

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the coconutty curried noodles with crispy tofu in a bowl

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
