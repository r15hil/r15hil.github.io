### Step 2

Add the sweet potato wedges to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the drained chickpeas to the other side of the tray (or use a separate tray!) with your soy sauce and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the sweet potato is cooked through and tender and the chickpeas are starting to crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat and dried cranberries to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your cumin seeds to the pan

Toast for 1-2 min or until fragrant, then transfer the toasted seeds to a pestle & mortar and bash to a fine powder

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Cut your lemon[s] in half

### Step 6

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and coriander to the pestle & mortar with a generous pinch of salt and grind to a paste

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice of half your lemon[s] and stir it all together – this is your zhoug

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1578934400553-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add your pistachios and flaked almonds to a separate baking tray and put in the oven for 2-3 min or until golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, roughly chop the pistachios (Careful they may be hot!)

Add half of the chopped pistachios and flaked almonds (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked bulgur with the juice of the remaining lemon and give it a good mix up – this is your jewelled bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the roasted sweet potato and crispy chickpeas over the jewelled bulgur

Drizzle over the zhoug and garnish with the remaining nuts

Enjoy!
