## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar
- 8ml Sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 80g soured cream
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 6 plain tortillas
- 5g chives
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into wedges


### Step 2

Add the wedges to a large baking tray (or two!) with half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) 

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp – these are your spicy sweet potato wedges


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your shredded red cabbage and your red wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar - this is your quick-pickled red cabbage


### Step 4

Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your Henderson's relish, sriracha, remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir everything together until it combines and becomes a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely


### Step 6

Chop your chives finely

Combine your soured cream with the chopped chives – this is your soured cream & chive sauce


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

### Step 8

Load the warmed tortillas with the spicy sweet potato wedges and quick-pickled red cabbage

Drizzle over the buffalo sauce and the soured cream & chive sauce

Garnish with the grated cheese and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
