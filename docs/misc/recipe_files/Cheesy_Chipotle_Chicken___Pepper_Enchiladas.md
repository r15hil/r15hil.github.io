### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 2

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast, diced pepper, ground cumin and dried oregano with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer the chicken and pepper to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan

### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water

Grate your cheddar cheese

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your black beans

### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium heat and add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, then once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[22g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g] </span>plain flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Turn the heat down to low and stir your chipotle paste and tomato paste into the roux

### Step 5

Whisk the chicken stock into to the pan a little at a time, and cook for 5 min, stirring occasionally or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Season with a grind of black pepper – this is your chipotle sauce

Remove 1/3 of the chipotle sauce to a small saucepan – this is your enchilada topping

### Step 6

Add the black beans and cooked chicken & pepper to the remaining chipotle sauce and stir well – this is your chicken & pepper filling

Re-heat the enchilada topping on a high heat for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream consistency, whisking regularly

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little vegetable oil

### Step 7

Divide the chicken & pepper filling between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and place them in the greased oven-proof dish

Top with the enchilada topping and grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tortillas are crispy and the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy chipotle chicken & pepper enchiladas

### Step 8

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Serve the cheesy chipotle chicken & pepper enchiladas with the salad to the side

Enjoy!
