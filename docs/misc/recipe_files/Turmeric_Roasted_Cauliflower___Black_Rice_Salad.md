## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 20g rocket
- 1 red chilli
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 400g canned chickpeas
- 15g flaked almonds
- 1 cauliflower
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 80g black rice
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 20g coriander
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add the black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 25-30 min or until it's tender (it will still have a slight bite to it when cooked)

Once cooked, drain, rinse under cold water and give it a good shake to remove any excess water

Give the pot a quick rinse then return the rice to the pot


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, chop the cauliflower into florets

Drain and rinse the chickpeas


### Step 3

Add the cauliflower florets and drained chickpeas to a large bowl with the ground turmeric, ground cumin, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if the spices aren't sticking!


### Step 4

Add the coated cauliflower & chickpeas to a baking tray (or two!), and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through and crisp

Add the flaked almonds to the tray for the final 3-4 min until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch the flaked almonds like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice the cucumber finely

Roughly chop the cherry tomatoes

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop the ginger, then add the chopped ginger and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a pestle & mortar with a generous pinch of salt and grind to a paste

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely!

Add the juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your lemon & coriander dressing


### Step 7

Add the rocket, sliced cucumber and chopped cherry tomatoes to the cooked black rice with a pinch of salt

Add half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir it all together – this is your black rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the black rice salad topped with the turmeric roasted cauliflower & chickpeas

Drizzle the lemon & coriander dressing all over and garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserved chopped coriander and toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!
