## Ingredients

- Tahini (15g)
- Sushi rice (75g) x0
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Apple
- Sushi rice (150g)
- Garlic clove
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Carrot x2
- Mangetout (80g)
- Soy sauce (30ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml) x0
- Red chilli
- Honey (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time for fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), tahini, mayo and rice vinegar in a bowl – this is your Japanese-style dressing


### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your apple[s] finely, then chop into matchsticks (discard the core!)

Slice your mangetout in half lengthways

Add the grated carrot, apple matchsticks and halved mangetout to the bowl with the Japanese-style dressing then give everything a good mix up – this is your Japanese-style slaw


### Step 5

Combine your cornflour with your soy sauce and honey in a bowl – this is your soy sauce glaze

Slice your red chilli[es] finely


### Step 6

Slice your hake fillet[s] in half widthways

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 7

Once hot, add the sliced hake and cook for 3-4 min on one side

After 3-4 min, flip the hake, then add the soy sauce glaze to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the hake is fully coated – this is your soy-glazed hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the soy-glazed hake over the sticky rice with the Japanese-style slaw to the side

Garnish the hake with the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
