## Ingredients

- 1 courgette
- 100g feta
- 400g canned chickpeas
- 15g flaked almonds
- 10g coriander
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 pepper
- 1 lemon
- 75g bulgur wheat

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then cut into thin strips and dice into small cubes

Once hot, add the diced pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the flaked almonds to a baking tray and put in the oven for 3-6 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 4

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges, then peel and roughly chop the garlic

Top, tail and peel the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into lengths, until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Trim and finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then crumble the feta

Combine the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your lemon dressing


### Step 5

Drain and rinse the chickpeas


### Step 6

Add the drained chickpeas to a food processor with the chopped garlic, 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water and the juice of the remaining lemon

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the coriander and most of the cooked peppers (save some for garnish!)

Add a pinch of salt and blitz until fully combined and smooth – this is your pepper hummus


### Step 7

Add the drained bulgur, lemon dressing, crumbled feta, sliced spring onion and courgette ribbons to a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your feta & courgette salad

### Step 8

Serve the feta & courgette salad with the pepper hummus to the side

Garnish the hummus with the reserved pepper and top the salad with the toasted almonds

Enjoy!
