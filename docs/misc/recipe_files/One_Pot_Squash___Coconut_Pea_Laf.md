### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 7

Reboil a kettle

While the squash is cooking, combine the cultured coconut and nigella seeds in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your nigella yoghurt

Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Once the squash is cooked, mix through the refreshed peas – this is your squash & coconut pea-laf

### Step 8

Serve the squash & coconut pea-laf with the nigella yoghurt to the side

Tip: Look out for the cardamom pods and ginger halves and discard them!

Enjoy!
