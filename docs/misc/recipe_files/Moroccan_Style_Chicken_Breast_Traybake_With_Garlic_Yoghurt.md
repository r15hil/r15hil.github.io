## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Red onion
- Ras el hanout (1tbsp)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Couscous (80g)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove x2
- Parsley (5g)
- Red pepper
- Sweet potato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s], then chop the remaining red onion into wedges

Peel and finely grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced onion to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside


### Step 3

Add your chicken breast portion[s] and chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper, onion wedges and 2/3 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your ras el hanout and a drizzle of olive oil to the tray[s] with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is tender


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this your garlic yoghurt


### Step 5

Add your couscous and chicken stock mix to a heatproof bowl with 130ml <span class="text-purple">[190ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [260ml] </span>boiled water and a pinch of salt and mix it all together, then cover and set aside to soften

Fluff with a fork before serving


### Step 6

Drain and rinse the sliced onion in a sieve under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cooled, return it to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir it all together and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled onion

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once the chicken and veg are done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the softened couscous

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Moroccan-style chicken breast traybake

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style chicken breast traybake with the garlic yoghurt dolloped over

Garnish with the quick-pickled onion and chopped parsley

Enjoy!
