## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Tear your chestnut mushrooms into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the torn mushrooms and halved Tenderstem and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your peanut butter and soy sauce in a bowl with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of half the lime[s]

Add your toasted sesame oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water – this is your peanut sauce

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once the vegetables are starting to caramelise, remove the pan from the heat, then add your udon noodles and spinach with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> water

Return the pan to the heat and cook, covered for 2 min or until the spinach has started to wilt

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!


### Step 6

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person


### Step 7

Once the spinach has wilted, add the peanut sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are coated – this is your peanut butter veg-packed udon

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the peanut butter veg-packed udon

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
