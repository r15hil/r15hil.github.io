## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the dish in the oven and cook for an initial 25 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Pick your basil leaves from the stalks (you'll be using both)

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Cut your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into long strips


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges, sliced pepper and chopped garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Once softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes, basil stalks (you'll use the leaves later!) and dried oregano to the pan

Add in your vegetable stock mix and season with a good grind of pepper

Cook for a further 2 min, stirring regularly


### Step 6

Once the potatoes have had an initial 25 min, add the vegetables and any remaining juices from the pan into the oven-proof dish


### Step 7

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with salt and pepper, then add them to the vegetables and push them down slightly

Return the dish to the oven for 12-15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the hake is cooked through – this is your hake, red pepper & cherry tomato bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Tear your basil leaves roughly

Serve the hake, red pepper & cherry tomato bake and garnish with the torn basil leaves

Enjoy!
