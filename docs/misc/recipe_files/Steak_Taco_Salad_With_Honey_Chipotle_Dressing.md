## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then slice your tortillas in half and then into thin strips

Add the tortilla strips to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle them with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 7-8 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy tortilla strips


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season both sides with a pinch of salt, then once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 3

Whilst the steak is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters

Trim and thinly slice your spring onion[s]

Drain your sweetcorn

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a clean board to rest


### Step 4

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey, dried oregano and red wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your honey chipotle dressing


### Step 5

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 6

Add the shredded lettuce, sliced spring onion, chopped cherry tomatoes, drained sweetcorn and crispy tortilla strips to a bowl

Add half the chopped coriander and half the honey chipotle dressing (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your taco salad


### Step 7

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced rump steak over the taco salad

Drizzle the steak with the remaining honey chipotle dressing and garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
