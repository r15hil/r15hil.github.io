## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0

- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Plain tofu (280g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 2

Add the sliced red onion and pepper strips to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until soft and golden


### Step 3

While the vegetables are cooking, cut your tofu into 6 strips per person

Add the tofu strips to a bowl, drizzle with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up


### Step 4

Add your cornflour, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground cumin with a generous pinch of salt to a bowl and stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Add the coated tofu strips to the bowl and gently turn them until they're fully coated in the spice mix


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced tofu strips and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until crisp – this is your crispy tofu


### Step 6

While the tofu strips are cooking, add your tortillas to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)

Combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar, chopped coriander and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coriander mayo

Wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then shred it roughly

### Step 8

To assemble your Baja-style tacos, divide the shredded lettuce and roasted onion & peppers between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with 2 crispy tofu strips and a drizzle of the coriander mayo

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!
