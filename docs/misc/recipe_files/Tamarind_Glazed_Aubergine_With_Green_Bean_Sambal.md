![Step 1 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-1-1676982506493-x200.jpg)

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s], then cut into quarters lengthways

Score the aubergine on the diagonal (about 1cm apart), making sure not to cut all the way down to the base

### Step 2

Add the scored aubergine quarters to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until the aubergine is tender and cooked through

While the aubergine is cooking, combine your agave, tamarind paste and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up then set aside – this is your tamarind glaze

### Step 3

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

### Step 4

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

While the rice is cooking, trim your green beans

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your shallot[s] and your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Add the chopped shallot and garlic to a food processor with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), lime leaf[ves], tomato paste, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and sugar

Blitz until smooth – this is your tomato sambal

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1676385915815-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the trimmed green beans and tomato sambal to the pan and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the green beans are tender – this is your green bean sambal

After an initial 25-30 min, remove the tray from the oven and brush the aubergine with the tamarind glaze, then return the tray to the oven for a further 5 min or until caramelised

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1676385926378-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the aubergine is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] in half

Combine your cultured coconut and chopped coriander in a small bowl with the juice of half the lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your lime coconut yoghurt

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

### Step 8

Chop the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the tamarind-glazed aubergine over the sticky rice with the green bean sambal and lime coconut yoghurt to the side

Drizzle over any remaining tamarind glaze from the tray

Garnish with the crushed peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
