## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and ground cumin to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Drain and rinse your black beans

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and chipotle stock and cook, covered, for 5-7 min or until the beans are soft enough to mash


### Step 6

While the black beans are cooking, cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Once the beans have softened, add a generous knob of<span class="text-danger"> </span>butter and mash them until smooth – these are your Brazilian-style black beans


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the pulled chicken to a bowl with your mango chutney, sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Zest and juice half your lime[s] into the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty lime free range chicken

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the Brazilian-style black beans over the brown rice and top with the zesty lime free range chicken

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
