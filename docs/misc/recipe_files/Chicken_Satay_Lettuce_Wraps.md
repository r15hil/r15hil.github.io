## Ingredients

- British chicken breast strips (125g) x0
- Gem lettuce x2
- Wholewheat noodle nest
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Smooth peanut butter (26g)
- Carrot
- British chicken breast strips (250g)
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Lime
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain the soaked noodles


### Step 2

While the noodles are soaking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Once starting to soften, push the sliced onion to one side of the pan and increase the heat to high, then add your chicken breast strips

Cook for 10-12 min or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, separate 6 outer lettuce leaves per person, wash and dry them well with kitchen paper then shred the inner core[s] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely

Grate your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cut your lime[s] in half

Cut half the lime[s] into wedges


### Step 6

Combine your creamy peanut butter, chilli relish, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl

Add your soy sauce and the juice of half the remaining lime and stir it all together – this is your satay sauce


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the shredded chicken, cooked onion, grated carrot, shredded lettuce, mint, coriander and satay sauce to the pan with the drained noodles

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken satay noodle filling

### Step 8

Divide the chicken satay noodle filling between the lettuce leaves

Garnish with your sesame seeds and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
