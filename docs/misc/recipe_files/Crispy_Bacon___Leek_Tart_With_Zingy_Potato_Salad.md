## Ingredients

- 20g rocket
- 160g puff pastry
- 90g Jolly Good smoked streaky bacon
- 50g soft cheese
- 3 white potatoes
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1 leek

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Chop the streaky bacon roughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves

Top, tail and slice finely

Once the bacon is starting to crisp, transfer to a plate and set aside until later

Add the sliced leek to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the leek is softening, add the soft cheese to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>boiled water and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up – this is your soft cheese mixture


### Step 4

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!


### Step 5

Spread the soft cheese mixture over the pastry within the border

Add the softened leeks and top with the crispy bacon

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up – this is your crispy bacon & leek tart


### Step 6

While the tart is in the oven, cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 7

Once the tart is cooked through, add the white wine vinegar to the potatoes with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Gently mix the rocket through the potatoes – this is your zingy potato salad

### Step 8

Cut the crispy bacon & leek tart in half and serve it with the zingy potato salad to the side

Enjoy!
