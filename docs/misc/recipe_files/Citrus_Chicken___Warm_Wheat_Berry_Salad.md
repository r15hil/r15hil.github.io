## Ingredients

- 80g fine green beans
- 10g parsley & chive mix
- 125g radishes
- 125g baby plum tomatoes
- 130g wheat berries
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet 
- 15g caper buds
- 4 spring onions
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Add the wheat berries to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)


Cook over a high heat for 10 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the baby plum tomatoes in half


Slice the radishes finely into rounds


Chop the green beans in half


Trim, then finely&nbsp;slice the spring onions&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Once the wheat berries have been cooking for 10 min, add the chopped green beans and cook for a further 3-4 min or until everything is tender&nbsp;


When the beans are tender, drain and return to the pot


Add the chopped tomatoes, radishes and spring onions&nbsp;to the drained wheat berries and set aside&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, zest&nbsp;the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a bowl


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces


Add the sliced chicken to the bowl of lemon zest with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;


Give everything a good old mix up


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the chicken to the pan with any remaining oil and lemon zest


Cook for 6-8 min, turning once halfway or until cooked through &ndash; this is your citrus chicken


Meanwhile, chop the capers finely


Chop the chives and parsley finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer it to a board to rest


Return the pan to a very low heat and add 40g <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> butter&nbsp;


Cook for 30 sec-1 min or until melted&nbsp;


Add the chopped capers and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and a pinch of salt&nbsp;&ndash; this is your caper butter dressing&nbsp;


### Step 7

Slice the rested chicken


Add the caper butter dressing to the wheat berries with the chopped herbs and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;


Give everything a good mix up &ndash; this is your wheat berry salad&nbsp;

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges&nbsp;


Serve the sliced citrus chicken over the wheat berry salad&nbsp;


Season with a generous grind of&nbsp;black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge


Enjoy!
