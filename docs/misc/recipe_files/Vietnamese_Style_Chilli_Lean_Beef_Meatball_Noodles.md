### Step 4

Divide the beef mixture, shape them into 3 meatballs per person and flatten them slightly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until nicely browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)
