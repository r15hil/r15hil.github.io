## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and boil a kettle

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a plate and set aside until serving, reserving the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 2

Add your orzo to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orzo for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orzo, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and the pot


### Step 3

Reboil half a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], skin side down

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your sun-dried tomatoes finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes with your roasted garlic paste and tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine and vegetable stock to the pot and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the spinach and drained orzo to the pot and give everything a good mix up until the spinach starts to wilt

Once wilted, remove the pot from the heat and stir through your crème fraîche

Season with a pinch of salt and generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato & spinach orzo

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato & spinach orzo and top with the pan-fried salmon

Garnish with the toasted pine nuts, a small drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
