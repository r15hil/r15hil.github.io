## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle

Slice your flat white mushrooms roughly, then trim the green stalk[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until everything is slightly browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, gently add your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the egg from cracking) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside

Reboil a kettle


### Step 3

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your miso paste, soy sauce and vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[1L] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.3L] </span>boiled water with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your miso stock

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Add the miso stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and add the spinach and fine egg noodles and continue cooking for 2-3 min or until the noodles are tender and the spinach has wilted – this is your miso noodle broth


### Step 7

Meanwhile, peel and cut the cooled egg[s] in half

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 8

Serve the miso noodle broth in a bowl

Top with the cooked mushrooms, aubergine and halved egg[s]

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds, chopped spring onions and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
