### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Slice the chicken breast portions into thin strips, then add them to a bowl with the ground paprika, ground cumin and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up and put in the fridge to marinate until later

### Step 2

Meanwhile, dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>as finely as you can

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 6 min or until softened

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking!)

Dissolve the chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the bulgur wheat and sultanas, then cook for 1 min or until coated in the oil

Add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the water has absorbed and the bulgur is cooked – this is your tomato bulgur pilaf

### Step 5

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, preheat the grill to high

Thread the marinated chicken strips evenly onto 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> soaked skewers, leaving a small gap between each piece – these are your chicken shish kebabs

### Step 6

Add the chicken shish kebabs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray under the grill for 12-14 min, turning once halfway, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and slightly charred

While the chicken is cooking, add the coconut yoghurt to a bowl with a pinch of salt and a small squeeze of juice from the remaining lemon (save the rest for later!) – this is your lemon coconut yoghurt

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1643122718614-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rest of the juice from the remaining lemon to a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the grated carrot, diced tomato and baby leaf salad and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salad

### Step 8

Drizzle the lemon coconut yoghurt over the chicken shish kebabs and serve with the tomato bulgur pilaf and the zingy salad to the side

Enjoy!
