### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] and potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray(or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your fries

### Step 2

Slice half your chilli[es] finely into rounds (you'll use the rest later!)

Zest your lime[s]

Peel your garlic

Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with the juice of half the lime[s] and the chilli rounds and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli

### Step 3

Add the remaining chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the peeled garlic to a food processor with the lime zest, ground smoked paprika, ground turmeric, creamed coconut, ginger paste and the juice of the remaining lime[s]

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your coconut marinade

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the ingredients and grind to a paste in a pestle & mortar instead!

### Step 4

Add your mayo to a bowl with half your coconut marinade (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sunshine mayo

### Step 5

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] in half, as if you were cutting a burger bun

Add the halved chicken to a large bowl with the remaining coconut marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut marinated chicken

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coconut marinated chicken and cook for 6 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy coconut chicken

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1690285135369-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Fill the warmed brioche with a handful of salad, the spicy coconut chicken, a dollop of sunshine mayo and the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserve the pickling liquid from the pickled chilli

Serve the remaining salad with a drizzle of olive oil and the reserved pickling liquid and set the fries and any remaining sunshine mayo to the side

Enjoy!
