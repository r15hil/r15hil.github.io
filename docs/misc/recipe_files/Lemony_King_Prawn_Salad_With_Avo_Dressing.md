## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 0 raw peeled king prawns
- 1 tomato
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 1 ciabatta
- 1 avocado
- 80g spinach
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tear your ciabatta[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the torn ciabatta[s] to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until golden and crisp – these are your croutons


### Step 3

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly


### Step 4

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 5

Add half of the diced avocado (you'll use the rest later!), a couple of slices of garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and most of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) to a food processor

Add the juice of half your lemon[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp</span>] olive oil, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span>[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your avo dressing


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the remaining sliced garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Once cooked, squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon – these are your lemony king prawns


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with the tomato wedges, remaining diced avocado and croutons

Season with a pinch of salt and a little olive oil and give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the lemony king prawns over the salad and drizzle the avo dressing all over

Garnish with a grind of black pepper and the remaining basil

Enjoy!
