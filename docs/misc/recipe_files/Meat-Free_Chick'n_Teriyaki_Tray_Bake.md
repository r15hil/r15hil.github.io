### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skin on (this helps them cook quicker!)

### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato and onion wedges to a tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your cornflour to a small bowl with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up

Heat a pot with a lid over a medium-low heat

Add your agave, soy sauce and cornflour mixture to the pot and cook, uncovered, for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, or until the sauce has thickened – this is your teriyaki sauce

Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a bowl and set aside for later

### Step 4

Once the sauce is done, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, push them to one side of the tray[s] and add the halved green beans on top – these are your roasted vegetables

Add your meat-free chick'n to the other side of the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 10-13 min or until the beans are tender and the meat-free chick'n is brown and has warmed through

### Step 7

Once everything is cooked, carefully cut off the root[s] and remove the skin from the roasted onion wedges

### Step 8

Serve the roasted vegetables and meat-free chick'n over the cooked rice

Drizzle the teriyaki sauce over everything and garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
