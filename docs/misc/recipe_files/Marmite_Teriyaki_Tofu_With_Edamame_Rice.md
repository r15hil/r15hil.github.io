### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered until serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the tofu cubes and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your Marmite to a small bowl with your soy sauce, maple syrup, cornflour and mirin and mix it all together – this is your Marmite teriyaki sauce

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

### Step 5

Once the tofu cubes are crisp and golden, reduce the heat to very low

Wait for the pan to cool down a little, then add the Marmite teriyaki sauce

Cook for 1-2 min, stirring occasionally, until a thick, glossy sauce coats the tofu cubes

### Step 6

Once the sauce is thick and glossy, add the crushed peanuts to the pan and gently mix until the tofu is coated in the nuts – this is your Marmite teriyaki tofu

### Step 7

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Once the rice is done, stir through your blanched edamame beans with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your edamame rice

### Step 8

Serve the Marmite teriyaki tofu over the edamame rice

Enjoy!
