- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Soy sauce (30ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges, then separate the layers into petals

Cut your orange[s] in half


### Step 3

Combine your cornflour with half your five-spice mix (you'll us the rest later!), your black sesame seeds and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a large bowl

Drain, then add your king prawns to the bowl and mix together until coated in the sesame batter


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Add the battered prawns and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until cooked through and crispy – these are your sesame prawns


### Step 5

While the prawns are cooking, combine the juice of the orange[s], rice vinegar, honey and soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your orange sauce

Once the sesame prawns are cooked through, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the onion petals, pepper strips and remaining five-spice mix and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the orange sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce is beginning to thicken


### Step 7

Once beginning to thicken, return the sesame prawns to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the prawns – this is your sesame orange king prawn stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the sesame orange king prawn stir-fry over the basmati rice

Enjoy!
