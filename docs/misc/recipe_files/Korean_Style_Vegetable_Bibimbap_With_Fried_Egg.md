### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with half your toasted sesame oil, half your rice vinegar, half your toasted sesame seeds (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your bibimbap sauce

### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail and slice your cucumber[s] (as finely as you can)

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs, then slice into half moons and slice your chestnut mushrooms

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 5

Add the grated carrot and sliced cucumber to a bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – these are your quick-pickled carrot & cucumber

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, once hot, add the chopped garlic and spinach with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted, then transfer to a bowl and reserve the pan – this is your garlic spinach

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1657786589554-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and courgette and cook for 6-8 min or until softened and golden

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce and remaining toasted sesame oil in a bowl

Once golden, transfer the cooked veg to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated veg

### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 8

Serve the sticky rice in a bowl with the marinated veg, garlic spinach and quick-pickled carrot & cucumber to the side

Top with the fried egg and the bibimbap sauce and sprinkle over the remaining toasted sesame seeds

Tip: To eat this the Korean way, give everything a mix up to coat it all in the bibimbap sauce

Enjoy!
