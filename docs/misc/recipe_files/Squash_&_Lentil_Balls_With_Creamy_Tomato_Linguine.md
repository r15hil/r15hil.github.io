### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min or until the butternut squash cubes are fork-tender

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half the panko breadcrumbs (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently

Once golden, transfer the toasted panko breadcrumbs to a small bowl and reserve the pan

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the softened butternut squash and beluga lentils to a food processor with the dried oregano, remaining panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt

Pulse for 7 secs until roughly blitzed then divide the mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> and shape into balls – these are your squash & lentil balls

Add the squash & lentil balls to an oiled baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 4

While the squash & lentil balls are in the oven, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped parsley and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl of toasted panko breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up – this is your parsley pangrattato

### Step 6

Dissolve the tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy tomato stock

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1659885170461-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once thickened add the drained linguine and grated Italian hard cheese to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 30 secs or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your creamy tomato linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the squash & lentil balls over the creamy tomato linguine

Sprinkle the parsley pangrattato all over

Enjoy!
