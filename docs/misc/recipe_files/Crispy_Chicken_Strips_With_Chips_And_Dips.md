### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your chicken breasts portion[s] into 3 strips per person

Add 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> milk to a large bowl with half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add the chicken strips to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later

Tip: This will help to tenderise your chicken!

### Step 3

Peel and grate (don't chop) your garlic

Add the grated garlic to a small pot with your chilli relish, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Heat the pot over a low heat, stir everything together until fully combined and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened to a syrup-like consistency – this is your sweet chilli dip

### Step 4

Chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives and your soured cream in a small bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your soured cream & chive dip

### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the shredded lettuce and grated carrot to a bowl and toss everything together – this is your carrot salad

### Step 6

Discard all the excess marinade from the chicken

Add your cracked black pepper, ground paprika, cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the bowl with the marinated chicken

Season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1658234472830-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your crispy chicken strips

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chicken strips with the chips and carrot salad to the side

Dollop the soured cream & chive and sweet chilli dips to the side, get dipping

Enjoy!
