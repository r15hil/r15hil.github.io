### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp

### Step 2

While the sweet potato is cooking, slice your red chilli[es] finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 3

Cut your naan[s] in half

Spread your mango chutney evenly over one side of the halved naan[s] and top with your ground cumin and grated cheese

Top with your nigella seeds, sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for later!)

Sandwich the halved naan[s] together

### Step 4

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 5

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Once the sweet potatoes are almost done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

### Step 6

Once hot, add the naan sandwich[es] and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (e.g. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 2-3 min per side, checking occasionally – this is your cheddar, chilli & mango naan toastie

Tip: You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 7

While the toastie[s] is cooking, add the salad, grated carrot, halved cherry tomatoes, roast sweet potato and remaining sliced spring onion to the bowl with the dressing

Gently toss everything together – this is your salad

### Step 8

Cut the cheddar, chilli & mango naan toastie[s] in half and serve with the salad to the side

Garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!
