## Ingredients

- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 11g veg stock mix
- 2 burrata balls (200g)
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 120g asparagus spears
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 25g hazelnuts
- 10g parsley
- 1 garlic clove
- 160g arborio rice
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions

### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 2

Dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water  - this is your vegetable stock

Trim the asparagus stalks, discard any woody ends

Chop the asparagus stalks roughly until you're just left with the tips

### Step 3

Whilst the onion is starting to soften, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

### Step 4

Add the roughly chopped asparagus stalks to the pan (save the tips for later!)

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20 min or until most of the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked

### Step 5

Whilst the risotto is cooking, bash the hazelnuts with a rolling pin

Tip: Keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop the parsley finely

### Step 6

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the asparagus tips, grated Italian hard cheese and Chinese wine to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the asparagus is tender and the rice is cooked with a slight bite

### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the crushed hazelnuts and panko breadcrumbs with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden

Once golden, remove the pan from the heat, add the chopped parsley and lemon zest and give everything a good mix up – this is your hazelnut pangrattato

### Step 8

Stir the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon through the asparagus risotto and cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the asparagus risotto and top with the burrata

Pierce the burrata and drizzle with a little olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Spoon over the hazelnut pangrattato and garnish with a wedge of lemon

Enjoy!
