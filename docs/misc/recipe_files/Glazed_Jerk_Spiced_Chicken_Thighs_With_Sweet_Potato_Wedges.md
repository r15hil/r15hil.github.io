## Ingredients

- 1 spring onion
- 0 British skin-on chicken thighs
- 160g carrot & cabbage slaw mix
- 0 tomato ketchup
- 1 Jerk paste
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 30ml tomato ketchup
- 0 mayonnaise
- 320g British skin on chicken thighs
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 15ml white wine vinegar

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped


### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges

Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp


### Step 3

Combine half of your jerk paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with half of your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your jerk marinade


### Step 4

Once the chicken skin has crisped, transfer the browned chicken to the jerk marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken

Transfer the marinated chicken to an oven-proof dish and pour over any excess marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through and slightly charred (no pink meat!) – this is your roasted jerk chicken


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and mayo in a bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your slaw


### Step 6

Combine your ketchup and the remaining jerk paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your jerk glaze


### Step 7

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Once the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through, add the roasted jerk chicken (and any chicken juices!) to the bowl with the jerk glaze

Give it a good mix up – these are your glazed jerk-spiced chicken thighs

### Step 8

Serve the glazed jerk-spiced chicken thighs with the slaw and sweet potato wedges to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
