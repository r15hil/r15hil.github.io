### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1

Add your shredded kale to a large baking tray with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crispy – this is your crispy kale

### Step 2

Heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Drain and rinse your butter beans

### Step 4

Once the bacon is golden, add the sliced leek and diced carrot to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and soft cheese with 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1.1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

### Step 5

Once the vegetables have softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), drained butter beans, dried thyme, bay leaf[ves], most of your southern fried seasoning (save some for garnish!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the creamy stock with a generous grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-10 min or until the vegetables are tender and the stock has thickened slightly – this is your southern-style butter bean & bacon soup

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the remaining chopped garlic to a small bowl with 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter and mix until fully combined – this is your garlic butter

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Spread the toasted ciabatta with the garlic butter and slice in half – these are your garlic toasts

### Step 8

Serve the southern-style butter bean & bacon soup in bowls and top with the crispy kale

Serve the garlic toasts to the side and sprinkle the kale with the remaining southern fried seasoning

Enjoy!
