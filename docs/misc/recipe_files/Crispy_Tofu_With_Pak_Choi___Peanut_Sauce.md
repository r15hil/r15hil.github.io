## Instructions


### Step 1

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes

Combine your ground cumin and cornflour in a bowl, add a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix

Add the tofu cubes to the bowl and mix until everything is evenly coated


### Step 2

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the base off the pak choi and discard, then slice the rest finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated tofu cubes and cook for 6-8 min, turning occasionally until crisp

Once the tofu is crisp, transfer it to kitchen paper and set aside (save the pan!) – this is your crispy tofu


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5 min until tender, then drain and return them to the pot until serving


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the grated ginger and sliced pak choi and cook for 3-4 min or until the pak choi starts to soften


### Step 6

Add your peanut butter, soy sauce, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and 100ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> [150ml]</span> water to the pak choi and give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt

Cook for a further 1 min, or until the liquid is well mixed and starts to thicken slightly – this is your pak choi & peanut sauce


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Slice your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy tofu and pak choi & peanut sauce over the wholewheat noodles

Top with the chopped coriander, sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
