## Ingredients

- 2 medium egg noodle nests
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 30ml soy sauce
- 280g plain tofu
- 2 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Crumble the tofu into a large bowl with your hands with half the soy sauce  (you'll use the rest later!) and set aside to marinate


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Trim, then slice the spring onions lengthways into batons

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min until they're tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 5

Once the tofu is golden, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, spring onion batons and sliced pepper to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 6

Add the toasted sesame oil to the drained noodles and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame noodles


### Step 7

Once the vegetables have softened, reduce the heat to low and add the remaining soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, sesame noodles and a splash of water to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are coated in the sauce – this is your Chinese-style tofu & pepper chow mein

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style tofu & pepper chow mein

Enjoy!
