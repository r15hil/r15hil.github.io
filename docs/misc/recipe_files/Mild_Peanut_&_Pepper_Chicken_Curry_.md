### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed your red and green pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), cut into thin strips then add to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and beginning to char – these are your roasted peppers

### Step 2

Cut the chicken breast strips into large, bite-sized pieces

Add your curry powder, ground paprika, ground turmeric and the juice of half your lime to a bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt – this is your marinade

Add the chopped chicken to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside

Peel and finely chop your garlic and onion[s]

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 4 min or until softened

### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Once the onion has softened, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Add the marinated chicken and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly browned

### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water

Add your peanut butter to the stock with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix everything together – this is your peanut stock

Bash your roasted peanuts in their bag with a rolling pin

### Step 6

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 7

Once the chicken has browned, add the peanut stock and most of the crushed peanuts (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan and stir everything together

Once done, remove the roasted peppers from the oven and add them to the pan with the chicken

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the mild peanut & pepper chicken curry over the basmati rice

Garnish with the remaining chopped peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
