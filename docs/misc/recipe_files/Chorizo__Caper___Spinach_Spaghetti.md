### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Add the diced chorizo and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp

### Step 7

Add the spinach to a colander and use the remaining boiled water in your kettle to pour over it so that it starts to wilt

Add the wilted spinach to the pan with a very generous crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your chorizo, caper & spinach sauce

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo, caper & spinach sauce over the cooked spaghetti

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
