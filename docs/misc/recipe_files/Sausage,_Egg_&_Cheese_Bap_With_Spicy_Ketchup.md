Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Slice your cheddar cheese into 3 slices per person

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

### Step 3

Divide your sausage meat into 1 piece per person (remove the paper if required!), shape into a thick patty[ies] and transfer to a floured chopping board

Press down the thick patty[ies] to evenly flatten and sprinkle over a handful of flour to cover – this is your sausage patty[ies]

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage patty[ies] and cook for 5 min or until browned on one side

Tip: Press the patty down with a spatula to keep it nice and flat throughout cooking

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato ketchup in a small bowl with a small splash of cold water and a little drizzle of olive oil – this is your spicy ketchup

### Step 6

Once the sausage has had 5 mins, flip over the patty[ies] and top with the sliced cheddar and cook for 3 min further

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

### Step 7

Once the patties have had 3 min, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until the egg[s] is done to your liking and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 8

Top a toasted ciabatta base with some blanched spinach, a few slices of tomato, a cheesy sausage patty, a fried egg, and a ciabatta lid – this is your sausage, egg & cheese bap

Serve the spicy ketchup to the side

Time to start your day!
