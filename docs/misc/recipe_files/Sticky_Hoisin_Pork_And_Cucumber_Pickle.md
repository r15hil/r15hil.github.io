### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with vegetable oil, season generously with salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden

### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, halve your cucumber lengthways, scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon and discard, then finely slice the flesh

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and give everything a good mix up - this is your marinade

### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the sliced cucumber, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and rice vinegar in a bowl

Mix well and set aside – this is your cucumber pickle

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a hight heat

Once hot, shake off the excess marinade from the pork (you'll use the rest later) and add to the pan

Cook the pork loin for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through

Once done, transfer the cooked pork to a clean chopping board or plate (reserve the pan), cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for 5 min

### Step 6

Add the remaining marinade to the reserved pan

Cook for 3-5 min or until it's approaching a dark, thick and sticky consistency – this is your glaze

Tip: The glaze will continue to thicken when it’s off the heat

Serve the potato wedges and cucumber pickle to the side

Enjoy!
