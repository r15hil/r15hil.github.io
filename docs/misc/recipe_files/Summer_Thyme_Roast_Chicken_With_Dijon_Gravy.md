### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrots lengthways into long batons

### Step 2

Add the carrot batons to an oven-proof dish with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and top with your thyme

Lay the chicken breasts over the carrots and thyme and season generously with salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the dish in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the carrots are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your thyme summer roast chicken & roasted carrots

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for an initial 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and Dijon mustard in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Dijon stock

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced garlic and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your mustard stock and a pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, add your blanched peas to the pot and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Once warmed through, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your potato & pea medley

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, pour any roasting juices from the chicken into the gravy – this is your Dijon gravy

### Step 8

Discard the thyme stalks from the dish

Serve the thyme summer roast chicken with the roasted carrots and potato & pea medley to the side

Drizzle the Dijon gravy over everything

Enjoy!
