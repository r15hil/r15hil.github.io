## Ingredients

- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Spring onion
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- Shredded red cabbage (150g)
- Ciabatta x2
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Carrot
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 3

Combine your cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add your shredded red cabbage, grated carrot and half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your red cabbage slaw

Combine your mayo and chilli relish in a small bowl – this is your chilli mayo


### Step 4

Combine your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper and a very large pinch of salt on a plate

Mix all the spices together – this is your Cajun-style seasoning


### Step 5

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and then slice in half

Press the halved hake fillet[s] into the Cajun-style seasoning firmly to evenly coat all over


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until the hake is cooked through – this is your Cajun-style hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a baking tray, cut-side up

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

### Step 8

To serve, spread the warmed ciabatta with the chilli mayo and top with the Cajun-style hake and some of the red cabbage slaw

Serve the chips and remaining red cabbage slaw to the side and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
