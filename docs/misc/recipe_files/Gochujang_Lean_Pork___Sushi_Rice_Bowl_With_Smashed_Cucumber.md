- British lean pork mince (<5% fat) (250g)
- Red pepper
- British lean pork mince (<5% fat) (125g) x0
- Ginger paste (15g)
- Gochujang paste (30g)
- Sushi rice (150g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

- Mirin (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min


### Step 2

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Boil half a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve most of your gochujang paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [340ml] </span>boiled water (save the rest of the gochujang for later!)

Add your soy sauce, mirin, chicken stock mix and half your rice vinegar and stir it all together – this is your gochujang stock


### Step 5

Once the pork mince is starting to brown, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the sliced pepper and cook for a further 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and your ginger paste

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the gochujang stock to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your gochujang lean pork


### Step 7

Meanwhile, bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water, the water is drawn out more easily!

Add the smashed cucumber to a bowl with your mayo, remaining gochujang (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your smashed cucumber

### Step 8

Serve the gochujang lean pork over the sushi rice with the smashed cucumber to the side

Garnish with your black sesame seeds and drizzle any remaining sauce over the cucumber

Enjoy!
