## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your portobello mushroom[s] into 8 wedges


### Step 3

Add the portobello mushroom wedges to the dish with a generous pinch of salt


### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into rounds

Add the carrot rounds to the dish with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> flour


### Step 5

Add your beluga lentils to the dish with the dried oregano and give everything a good mix

Wash your lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Stir through your Marmite and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your pie filling


### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice your potato[es] (skins on) into discs

Carefully arrange the potato discs over the top of the pie filling

Season with a pinch of salt and put the dish in the oven for 40 min or until everything's bubbling and the potatoes are cooked through – this is your all-in-one hearty mushroom & lentil pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Combine your salad with your cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl – this is your dressed salad

Season the all-in-one hearty mushroom & lentil pie with a grind of pepper and serve the dressed salad to the side
