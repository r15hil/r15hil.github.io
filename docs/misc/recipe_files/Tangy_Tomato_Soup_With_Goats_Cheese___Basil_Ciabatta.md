### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skin on (this helps them cook quicker)

### Step 2

Add the halved cherry tomatoes, onion wedges and garlic (skins on) to a baking tray (or two!)

Add your dried oregano with a large drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 5 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, roughly tear your basil, including the stalks

Add the torn basil and a pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and bash for 1-2 min or until it looks like a purée (alternatively, pulse in a food processor)

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) then stir to combine – this is your balsamic basil purée

![Step 4 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-4-1585754008288-x200.jpg)

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle the remaining balsamic vinegar over the tomatoes

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10-12 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to caramelise

### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water in a pot and add your chopped tomatoes – this is your tomato stock

Once the tomatoes have caramelised, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully cut the roots from the onion wedges

Carefully remove the skins from the onion and garlic and discard (beware, they will be hot!)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1585754016002-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the roasted vegetables to the pot with the tomato stock

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 min

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a baking tray, cut side up

Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until they're hot and crusty

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1585754019874-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Remove the pot from the heat and roughly blitz everything up with a (stick) blender, leaving some chunks for texture – this is your tangy tomato soup

Season with a grind of black pepper

Remove the warmed ciabatta halves from the oven

### Step 8

Spread your goats' cheese over the warmed ciabatta halves and drizzle over half the balsamic basil purée

Serve the tangy tomato soup with the goats' cheese & basil ciabatta to the side

Drizzle the remaining balsamic basil purée over the soup

Enjoy!
