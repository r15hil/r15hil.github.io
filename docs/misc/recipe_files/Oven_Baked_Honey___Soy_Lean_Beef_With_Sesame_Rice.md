### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] roughly

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and the chopped carrot to the dish with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a stir, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sesame rice

### Step 5

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

After 15 min add your Tenderstem broccoli and cook covered for a further 10 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your oven-baked honey & soy lean beef
