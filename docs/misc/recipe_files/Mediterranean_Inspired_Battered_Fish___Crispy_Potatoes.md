## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 160g fine green beans
- 4 tbsp cornflour
- 30g balsamic sun-dried tomato paste
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 white potatoes
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and the dried oregano and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for an in initial 20 min


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim the green beans

Add the green beans and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a knob of butter, then scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 parcels!


### Step 3

After the initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the green bean parcel to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the green beans are tender – these are your crispy oregano potatoes & garlic green beans


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and mayo in a small bowl with half the balsamic sun-dried tomato paste (you’ll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and half the white wine vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tangy mayo


### Step 5

Add the cornflour and 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour to a shallow dish with the remaining balsamic sun-dried tomato paste, ground smoked paprika and the vegetable stock mix

Add the remaining white wine vinegar and 70ml <span class="text-danger">[140ml] </span>very cold water and whisk everything together until there are no lumps – this is your batter


### Step 6

When the potatoes are almost done, pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle both sides of the basa with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

Dip the floured basa into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your Mediterranean-inspired battered fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Mediterranean-inspired battered fish with the crispy oregano potatoes & garlic green beans to the side

Drizzle most of the tangy mayo over the vegetables and serve any remaining tangy mayo to the side

Enjoy!
