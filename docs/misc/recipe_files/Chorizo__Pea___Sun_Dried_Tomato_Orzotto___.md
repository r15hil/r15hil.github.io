- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- Orzo (75g) x0
- Orzo (150g)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Parsley (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your sun-dried tomatoes finely


### Step 3

Once the chorizo is crisp, add the diced onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Add your orzo and tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 11-12 min or until the orzo is cooked

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to prevent it from sticking!

Once the orzo is cooked, add your blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through


### Step 6

Whilst the orzo is cooking, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Add the salad to the bowl with the balsamic dressing and give everything a good mix – this is your balsamic salad


### Step 7

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Once the peas have warmed through, add most of the chopped parsley and half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and mix everything together – this is your chorizo, pea & sun-dried tomato orzotto

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo, pea & sun-dried tomato orzotto with the balsamic salad to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and remaining parsley, season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
