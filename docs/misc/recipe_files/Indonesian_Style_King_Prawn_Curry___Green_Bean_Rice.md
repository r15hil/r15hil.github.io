## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, and cook, covered until step 2


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the chopped green beans to the rice

Cook, covered for a further 10 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and chop your garlic roughly and peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) your ginger

Break your cardamom pod[s] open and discard the outer green shell

Grind the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, cardamom seeds, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar - this is your spice paste


### Step 4

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200 ml <span class="text-purple">[300 ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400 ml]</span> boiled water then add your fish sauce and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy coconut stock


### Step 5

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 6

Once the onion has started to brown, drain, then add your king prawns and spice paste and cook for 2 min


### Step 7

Add the spicy coconut stock and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Indonesian-style king prawn curry

Fluff the basmati rice and mix with the green beans – this is your green bean rice

### Step 8

Serve the Indonesian-style king prawn curry with the green bean rice

Garnish with your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
