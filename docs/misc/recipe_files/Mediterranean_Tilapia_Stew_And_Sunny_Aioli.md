## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 2 x 120g tilapia fillets
- 32g tomato paste
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 1 carrot
- 1 star anise
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 10g parsley
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion
- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Top, tail, peel and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and peel and finely chop the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and 10g <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, diced carrot, chopped tomatoes, sliced pepper and half the garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Add the star anise and cook for 8-10 min, or until the onion has started to soften and the tomatoes have broken down

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 3

While the vegetables are cooking, combine the vegetable stock mix and half of the ground turmeric (save the rest for later!) with 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your turmeric stock

Once the vegetables have softened, add the tomato paste and cook for 1 min, stirring continuously

Add the turmeric stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-6 min or until reduced by half


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the remaining ground turmeric with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> boiled water and stir until you have a smooth paste

Add the mayo, remaining chopped garlic and white wine vinegar

Whisk in a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of black pepper – this is your sunny aioli


### Step 5

Add the ciabattas to a baking tray, drizzle them with a little olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min, or until they're hot and crusty


### Step 6

Pat the tilapia fillets dry with kitchen paper

Gently add the tilapia to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the tilapia is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Stir most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) carefully through the cooked stew – this is your Mediterranean tilapia stew

### Step 8

Serve the Mediterranean tilapia stew with the hot ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle over the sunny aioli

Tip: Don't forget to remove the star anise!

Enjoy!
