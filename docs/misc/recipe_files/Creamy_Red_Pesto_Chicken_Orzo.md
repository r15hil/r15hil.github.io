## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open then packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Meanwhile, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into rings, discarding the stalks


### Step 3

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and sliced pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken has browned slightly

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and set aside


### Step 4

While the chicken is browning, add your orzo to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orzo for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orzo


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned slightly, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chicken stock, your sun-dried tomato pesto and tomato paste

Season with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 6-8 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and add the drained orzo and your crème fraîche to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy red pesto chicken orzo

### Step 8

Serve the creamy red pesto chicken orzo and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Enjoy!
