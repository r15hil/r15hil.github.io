Cut your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel your garlic cloves

### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes and peeled garlic to a pot with plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> flour to a large plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Press your basa fillet[s] into the flour, so they are evenly coated (make sure to shake off any excess!)

### Step 5

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add the spinach to the pot and cook for a further 1 min or until it's wilted

Drain everything and return to the pot, then mash together with a knob of butter – this is your garlic mash

Season generously with salt and pepper, then cover to keep warm until serving

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook on a high heat for 3-4 min on each side until golden and cooked through

Once cooked transfer the basa to a plate, cover loosely with tin foil and set aside

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper and return it to a medium heat

Add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g] </span>butter to the pan and heat until melted, foaming and lightly browned, swirling the pan around, for approx. 1 min

Remove the pan from the heat and add the lemon juice, capers and chopped parsley and gently stir it all together – this is your lemon caper butter

### Step 8

Serve the cooked basa over the garlic mash and spoon the lemon caper butter all over

Serve the remaining lemon quarters to the side

Enjoy!
