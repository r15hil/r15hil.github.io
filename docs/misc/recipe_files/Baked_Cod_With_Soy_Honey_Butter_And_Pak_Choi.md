## Description

Cooking ‘en papillote’ (meaning in a sealed envelope) is a brilliantly simple way to keep fish succulent whilst creating an easy flavour-packed sauce. This Asian-inspired dish packs a punch from zingy ginger and a salty-sweet balance from soy sauce and honey. Served with rice and cashew nuts.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked and once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut 30g<span class="text-purple"> [45g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [60g]</span> butter into small pieces

Cut long rectangles of tin foil (approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper), overlap the foil and place on a baking tray

Tip: Overlapping the foil ensures that the fish is completely encased for cooking

### Step 3

Place your cod fillet[s] in the centre of the doubled foil (you'll need to make 2 parcels for 4 people)

Scatter with the chopped ginger and dot the butter evenly over

Drizzle your soy sauce, honey and rice vinegar evenly over the cod fillet – this is your soy honey butter

### Step 4

Scrunch the edges of the foil together around the fish to form sealed parcel[s] for per person

Put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash and slice your pak choi in half lengthways, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the halved pak choi, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly brown

Season with a pinch of salt

Once brown, add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until soft

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your cashew nuts to a separate baking tray and put them in the oven for 3-4 min or until they have darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once cooled, chop them coarsely

### Step 8

Serve the baked cod over the cooked rice, with the pak choi to the side

Spoon the soy honey butter over the baked cod and garnish with the toasted cashews

Enjoy!
