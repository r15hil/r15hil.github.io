### Step 1

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Once toasted, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your toasted coconut flakes

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 7

Once the mussels are cooked, add your sambal oelek and a squeeze of lime juice and give everything a good mix up – these are your sambal mussels

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Tip: Discard any mussels which shells have not opened!

### Step 8

Serve the sambal mussels with the basmati rice in the centre

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish the rice with the toasted coconut flakes and a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!
