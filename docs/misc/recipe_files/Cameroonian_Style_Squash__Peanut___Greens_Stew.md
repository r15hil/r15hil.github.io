## Description

The inspiration for this aromatic stew comes from the Cameroonian dish, 'ndolé', which is usually made with meat, prawns and greens. For this vegan twist, you'll add roasted butternut squash instead, along with kale, spinach and peanuts for a nutty crunch.

## Ingredients

- 1 bag of fried onions (15g)
- 120g spinach
- 25g roasted peanuts 
- 1 red chilli
- 1 whole butternut squash
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 11g veg stock mix	
- 26g smooth peanut butter 	
- 1 leek
- 80g shredded kale
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel the butternut squash and cut into quarters, lengthways, using a sharp knife

Tip: Drizzle the knife with a little vegetable oil for easier chopping

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard, then slice finely

Add to a foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt


### Step 2

Give everything a good mix up then put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Meanwhile, peel and slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until browned


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves

Top, tail and slice finely

Peel the ginger and garlic, then add to a food processor with a splash of cold water and blitz until you have a chunky paste

Add in the peanuts and blitz again until roughly chopped – this is your peanut paste

Tip: Add a splash more cold water if needed!


### Step 4

Once the sliced onions have browned, add the peanut paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, crumble in the Kallo vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and add the chopped tomatoes with 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up then cook for a further 3-4 min or until starting to thicken


### Step 5

Once the sauce is starting to thicken, wash the kale and spinach and add them to the pan

Pour over another 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything stir then cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the spinach and kale are wilted and cooked through

Tip: Add a splash more boiled water if the pan is looking dry!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, finely slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (not a fan of spice? Deseed the chilli!)


### Step 7

Once the kale and spinach have wilted, gently stir through most of the cooked squash, reserving a few slices for garnish

Add the peanut butter and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cameroonian-style squash, peanut & greens stew

### Step 8

Serve the Cameroonian-style squash, peanut & greens stew garnished with the reserved squash pieces

Sprinkle over the chilli rounds and crispy onions

Enjoy!
