## Ingredients

- Living lettuce
- Cheese flavour slices (2pcs) x2
- Tomato
- Umami seasoning (1tbsp)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Vegan 'Nduja (40g)
- Ciabatta x2
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3
- Sweet pepper relish (20g)
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 2

Add the potato and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the onion is tender, then remove from the oven

Transfer the roasted onion to a clean plate and return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5-10 min or until the potato wedges are golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Tear your cheese flavour slices and combine with your umami seasoning – this is your umami cheeze

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half


### Step 4

Top the ciabatta base[s] with your plant based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced tomato, half the roasted onion (save the rest for later!) and the umami cheeze

Place a ciabatta lid on top – this is your plant-based 'Nduja ciabatta


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the plant-based 'Nduja ciabatta and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 4-5 min per side, checking occasionally or until the ciabatta is golden and the cheeze has melted – this is your plant-based 'Nduja toastie


### Step 6

Whilst everything's cooking, combine your sweet pepper relish and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sweet pepper mayo

Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Remove the base of your lettuce, wash under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves


### Step 7

Add the remaining roasted onion and lettuce leaves to the bowl of dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your roast onion salad

### Step 8

Cut the plant-based 'Nduja toastie in half and serve with the wedges, roast onion salad and sweet pepper mayo to the side

Enjoy!
