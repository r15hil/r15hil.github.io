- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 15ml cider vinegar 	
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 10g coriander & mint mix

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain, and return to the pot


### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your curry powder with a generous pinch of salt and pepper on a plate

Add your hake fillet[s] and cover until they're completely coated

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your curried hake


### Step 4

While the fish is cooking, chop your cucumber in half, then slice finely

Peel and slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(as finely as you can!)


### Step 5

Combine your cider vinegar and chopped ginger in a bowl with the sliced cucumber, sliced shallot and your nigella seeds

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your quick-pickled cucumber salad


### Step 6

Add the chopped mint and chopped coriander to the drained potatoes with a generous knob of butter and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your herb butter potatoes


### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the curried hake with the herb butter potatoes, the baby leaf salad and quick-pickled cucumber salad to the side

Drizzle the salad leaves with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
