## Description

Kerala is famous for its coconut groves, so curries from this South Indian state are usually milder & sweeter. In this recipe from the Malabar region, you'll warm spices and add tamarind & coconut cream to create a delicious plant-based curry. (Gluten and dairy-free, suitable for coeliacs).

- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


Peel and finely dice (or grate!) the garlic


Peel and finely slice the ginger into thin matchsticks 


Dice the tomatoes, finely


### Step 2

Boil a kettle


Chop the cauliflower into bite-sized florets, discarding the leaves


### Step 3

Heat a<span class="text-highlight"> large, dry, wide-based pan</span> (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a medium heat


Once hot, add the cashew nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted, then remove from the pan


Chop the toasted cashew nuts, roughly


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil 


Once hot, add the red onion wedges, <span class="text-highlight">ground</span> turmeric, ground coriander and ground fenugreek


Season generously with salt and cook for 5-6 min until the onions have softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Once the onions have softened, add the garlic and <span class="text-highlight">half</span> the ginger matchsticks and cook for 2-3 min, stirring frequently, or until fragrant


Once fragrant, stir in the tomato paste and add the cauliflower florets and give everything a good mix up

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> vegetable stock cube, tamarind paste, chopped coconut cream in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


Add the diced tomatoes and coconut stock and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the cauliflower is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your Malabar Cauliflower curry

Serve the Malabar Cauliflower curry over the rice and garnish with the <span class="text-highlight">remaining</span> ginger matchsticks and chopped cashews


Enjoy!
