- Ground cumin (1tsp) x0
- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g) x2
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Red kidney beans (185g) x0
- Spring onion
- Ground cumin (2tsp)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until everything is beginning to soften

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your red kidney beans, then boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Once softened, add your ground cumin and chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>boiled water

Add your chopped tomatoes, drained red kidney beans and vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until a thick sauce remains – this is your enchilada filling


### Step 4

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Strip your parsley leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)


### Step 5

Stir the chopped parsley stalks through the enchilada filling

Divide 3/4 of the enchilada filling (save some for later!) between your tortillas, covering only half of each tortilla

Roll up the tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas


### Step 6

Place the enchiladas in an oven-proof dish, with the seam face down

Top with the remaining enchilada filling and the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until the cheese is golden and melted


### Step 7

While the enchiladas are in the oven, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Combine your ground smoked paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl

Add your mayo with a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your smoky mayo

### Step 8

Serve the enchiladas garnished with the parsley leaves and sliced spring onion

Drizzle over the smoky mayo

Enjoy!
