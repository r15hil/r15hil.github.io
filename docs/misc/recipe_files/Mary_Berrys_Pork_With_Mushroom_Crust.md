## Description

This is lovely for a midweek supper and ideal for preparing ahead. Served with hot green vegetables and buttered new potatoes. Mary's foolproof tip: Brown the pork  on all sides, including the fatty edges. This seals the juices in and prevents the pork from drying out during baking.

## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar
- 2 British pork loin steaks
- 120g fine green beans
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 1 tsp ground paprika 
- 30g panko breadcrumbs 
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 150g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 onion 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to&nbsp;200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(1 tbsp) </span>olive oil over a high heat


Pat the pork dry and season with salt and pepper


### Step 2

Once the pan is hot, sear the fatty edges of the pork for 1 min (use tongs to hold them in place), then cook for 2 min on each side or until golden


Meanwhile, line a baking tray with foil


Transfer the pork to the tray and set aside to cool down completely, reserving the pan for later


### Step 3

Peel and slice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> finely


Return the pan to a high heat with a knob of butter


Once hot, add the onions and cook for 3 min until starting to turn glossy, stirring constantly


Cover the pan with a lid, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 min or until softened and golden


### Step 4

Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms thinly


Grate the cheese


Cut the potatoes into bite-size chunks


Trim the green beans and cut in half


Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Once the onions are soft and brown, remove the lid and increase the heat to high to drive off any excess moisture


Add the mushrooms to the onions and cook for 5 min or until browned and all the liquid has evaporated, then remove the pan from the heat and season lightly with salt and pepper


### Step 6

Spread the mustard over the cooled pork


Spoon the mushroom mixture on top, dividing it evenly between the pork steaks


Sprinkle with the panko breadcrumbs, grated cheese and paprika


Bake in the oven for 10-15 min or until a golden crust has formed and the pork is cooked through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the potatoes to a pot of salted boiling water with a matching lid over a high heat


Bring to the boil and cook, covered, for an initial 7 min or until nearly cooked


Add the beans and cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until tender but with a slight bite


Drain the lot

### Step 8

Heat the potato pot over a low heat with another knob of butter


Once melted, add the drained potatoes and beans and mix until coated, then season lightly with salt and pepper


Serve the crusted pork with the buttered potatoes and green beans


Enjoy!
