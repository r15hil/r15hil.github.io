## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 400g udon noodle
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 300g rainbow veg mix
- 15ml soy sauce
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 2g shichimi togarashi
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 280g plain tofu
- 15ml mirin
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain the tofu and crumble it with your fingers directly into the pan

Add the ground turmeric and the small soy sauce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (save the larger one<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>for later) to the tofu and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to crisp – this is your crispy scrambled tofu


### Step 2

Once the tofu is crisp, add it to a plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the ginger & garlic paste to the pan with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the rainbow veg mix and cook for 2-3 min further until the veg has started to soften


### Step 4

Once the veg has softened slightly, add the udon noodles, Henderson's Relish, mirin and the large soy sauce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Give everything a good mix up until all the noodles are coated and cook for 1 min further until warmed through – these are your yaki udon noodles

### Step 5

Serve the yaki udon noodles with the crispy scrambled tofu over the top

Sprinkle over the shichimi togarashi and crispy onions

Enjoy!
