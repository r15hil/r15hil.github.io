### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes into quarters and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a pinch of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your roast potatoes

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until they’re beginning to break down

Finely chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add the chopped garlic, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, your balsamic vinegar, half your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans then add them to the pan with your finely chopped tomatoes, the tomato stock and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, reduce the heat to low-medium and cook, covered for 10 min or until the bean stew has thickened slightly

### Step 6

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the bean stew has thickened slightly, stir the spinach through and cook with a lid on, for 2-3 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your Italian bean stew

### Step 7

Toss your roast potatoes with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining dried oregano

Top the roast potatoes with the torn mozzarella and put the tray back in the oven for 6-7 min or until the cheese is golden and bubbling – these are your cheesy roast potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the Italian bean stew with the cheesy roast potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
