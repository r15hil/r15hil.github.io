### Step 3

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add your white wine vinegar and cook for a further 30 secs or until it has evaporated, then reduce the heat to medium-low

### Step 5

Whilst the risotto is cooking, roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

When the risotto is almost cooked, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass skin dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch with salt

Once hot, add your sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Once your risotto has absorbed all the stock, remove the cooked risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheddar cheese and a generous knob of butter

Add the juice of half your lemon[s]

Season very generously with pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon and saffron risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!

Top with the sea bass

Enjoy!
