### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo with 3/4 of the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until the chorizo has crisped and the onion has softened slightly

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened slightly, add your ground smoked paprika and chopped garlic to the pan

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add the drained black beans and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [80ml] </span>cold water

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2-3 min or until the liquid has absorbed and the beans have softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt, then stir everything together – this is your dressing

Add the remaining sliced onion and diced tomato to the dressing and set aside – this is your tomato & onion salsa

### Step 5

Once the beans have softened, remove the pan from the heat and crush the beans until they begin to form a coarse mash

Add the grated cheese and remaining cider vinegar and stir it all together – this is your chorizo & black bean filling

### Step 6

Divide the chorizo & black bean filling between your tortillas, covering only half

Fold each tortilla over and press down firmly so you're left with 3 half moon-shaped quesadillas per person – these are your quesadillas

### Step 7

Add the quesadillas to a baking tray (or two!)

Place a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking tray[s] in the oven for 12 min or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese is melted – these are your chorizo & black bean quesadillas

### Step 8

Slice the chorizo & black bean quesadillas in half and serve with the tomato & onion salsa to the side

Season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!
