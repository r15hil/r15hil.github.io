### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your chilli oil

### Step 4

Grate your Italian hard cheese

### Step 5

Add your fresh tagliatelle and chopped Tenderstem broccoli to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle and broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

While the tagliatelle is cooking, add your chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock mix to the pan with the chilli oil

Season with a pinch of salt, sugar and a grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened

### Step 7

Once thickened, add the drained tagliatelle and broccoli to the pan, tear in half your basil (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your spicy arrabbiata sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy arrabbiata sauce with fresh tagliatelle topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Tear over the remaining basil

Serve the cooked chicken breast to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
