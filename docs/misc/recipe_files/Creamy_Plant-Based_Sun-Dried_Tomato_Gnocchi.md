### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Add your gnocchi to the pan and cook for 8 min or until crisp and golden

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli tips away from the stalks, then finely chop the Tenderstem stalks (keep the tips and stalks separate!)

### Step 4

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and the chopped tenderstem stalks with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the vegetables are slightly softened

Once softened, add your roasted garlic paste, balsamic sun-dried tomato paste and Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix and your creamy single soy to the pan with your tenderstem tips

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato sauce

### Step 6

After the initial 6 min, add your pine nuts to the gnocchi pan and cook for a further 2 min or until the gnocchi and the pine nuts are golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, toss the golden gnocchi and toasted pine nuts through the creamy sun-dried tomato sauce – this is your creamy plant-based sun-dried tomato gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the creamy plant-based sun-dried tomato gnocchi

Tear your basil leaves over the gnocchi and garnish with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
