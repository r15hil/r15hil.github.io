### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 3

Once the chicken is browned, add the sliced onion, curry powder, ginger & garlic paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this is your pulled chicken

Return the pulled chicken back to the pan and give everything a good mix up so the chicken is evenly coated in the curry sauce – this is your curried chicken enchilada filling

### Step 5

Divide the curried chicken enchilada filling (reserving some of the curry sauce for later) between your tortillas

Roll up the tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas

Place the enchiladas in an oven-proof dish, with the seam side down

### Step 6

Spoon over the remaining curry sauce

Sprinkle over the grated cheese and your nigella seeds

Put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until bubbling and golden around the edges – these are your curried chicken enchiladas

Once cooked, top with sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your tamarind paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a large bowl along with a pinch of sugar – this is your sweet tamarind dressing

Add the salad to the bowl with the sweet tamarind dressing and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your tamarind dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the curried chicken enchiladas with the tamarind dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
