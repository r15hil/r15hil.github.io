## Ingredients

- 2 x 200g sirloin steak
- 80g oyster mushroom mix
- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 truffle flavoured extra virgin olive oil (8ml)
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 pot of Cornish clotted cream (40g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until the oil is very hot

Meanwhile, chop the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Pat the fries dry with kitchen paper

Tip: This helps the fries get extra crispy!


### Step 2

Chop the chestnut mushrooms roughly (keep the oyster mushrooms whole!)

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the oil is very hot, remove the tray from the oven and carefully add the fries to the oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a gentle mix up until the fries are coated in the oil

Return the tray to the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crispy


### Step 4

Pat the sirloin steaks dry with kitchen paper, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the sirloin steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side

For medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a plate to rest (reserve the pan)


### Step 6

Whilst the steak is cooking, add the Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain


### Step 7

Once the steak is resting, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the oyster mushrooms and cook for 3 min or until caramelised

Once caramelised, add the beef stock and clotted cream and cook for 1-2 min further or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency

Add the truffle oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your truffled mushroom sauce

### Step 8

Serve the sirloin steak with the fries and Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Drizzle the truffled mushroom sauce over the steak

Enjoy!
