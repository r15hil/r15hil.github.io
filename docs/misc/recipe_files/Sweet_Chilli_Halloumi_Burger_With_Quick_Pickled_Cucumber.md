## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Peel lengths off your cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons, then add them to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up then set aside for later – these are your quick-pickled cucumber ribbons


### Step 3

Place your hand flat onto your halloumi

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 1 halloumi steak per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 4

Once the pan is hot, add the halloumi steak[s] and cook for 2-3 min on each side until golden and crisp


### Step 5

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Remove the base of your lettuce

Wash your lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper 

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves


### Step 7

Add the halved cherry tomatoes to a bowl with your lettuce leaves – this is your salad

Drain the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber ribbons (set these aside for later!) into the salad

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper to your salad and give this a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Assemble your burger by filling each toasted brioche bun with a golden halloumi steak, a dollop of red chilli relish and some quick-pickled cucumber ribbons

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
