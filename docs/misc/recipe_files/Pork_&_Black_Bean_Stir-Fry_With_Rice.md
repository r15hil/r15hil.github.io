### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Peel and finely slice (don’t chop!) your garlic

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and roughly break it up with a wooden spoon so you're left with bite-sized pieces

Cook for 4-5 min turning once halfway until browned all over

### Step 4

While the pork is browning, trim your green beans, then chop into bite-sized pieces

### Step 6

Once the pork is beginning to brown, add the onion petals and chopped green beans to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and mix it all together

Cook for 2-3 min, stirring occasionally, until the onion petals are starting to soften

Once slightly softened, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the black bean stock and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a final 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pork mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork & black bean stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the pork & black bean stir-fry with the cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
