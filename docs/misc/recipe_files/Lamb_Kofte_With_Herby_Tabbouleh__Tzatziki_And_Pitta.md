## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with your lamb mince

Divide the lamb mince and shape into 3 koftes per person


### Step 3

Add the koftes to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15 min or until cooked through and golden (no pink meat!)

Dice your tomato[es]

Trim and finely slice your spring onion[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 5

Combine your natural yoghurt, half of the chopped mint (you'll use the rest later!) and grated cucumber in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tzatziki


### Step 6

Add the diced cucumber, tomato, sliced spring onion, chopped parsley and the remaining chopped mint to the pot with the drained bulgur wheat

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and squeeze in the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tabbouleh

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Serve the lamb kofte with the tabbouleh, pitta and tzatziki to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
