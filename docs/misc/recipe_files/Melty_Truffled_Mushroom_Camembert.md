### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Score the camemberts with a knife in a criss-cross pattern

Add the camemberts to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until melty in the middle

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add half the truffle oil (save the rest for later) and once hot, add the chopped mushrooms with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until tender and golden – these are your truffled mushrooms

Tip: Don't stir the mushrooms too often as this will stop them from caramelising!

### Step 7

Whilst everything's cooking, chop the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into slices, removing any core

Add the baby leaf salad, apple slices and toasted walnuts to a bowl with the balsamic dressing and gently mix together – this is your walnut & apple salad

### Step 8

Serve the baked camemberts topped with the truffled mushrooms

Drizzled over any remaining truffle oil and serve the ciabatta slices and walnut & apple salad to the side

Season with black pepper

Enjoy!
