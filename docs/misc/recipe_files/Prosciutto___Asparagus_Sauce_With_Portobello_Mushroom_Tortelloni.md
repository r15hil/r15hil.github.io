## Ingredients

- Portobello mushroom tortelloni (250g)
- Sliced prosciutto (52g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Rocket (20g)
- Asparagus spears (120g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your sliced prosciutto to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your sliced prosciutto every 30 secs to prevent them from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus and discard, then chop into thirds

Once hot, add the chopped asparagus to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Zest your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter), then roll with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 5

Add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Add the sliced garlic to the pan with the softened asparagus and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Cut the zested lemon into 1 wedge per person


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add a splash of starchy pasta water to the pan with a large knob of butter and a generous grind of black pepper

Give it a good stir until everything's combined and the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add the drained tortelloni, lemon zest and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for ganish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce

### Step 8

Serve the tortelloni with the salad and a lemon wedge to the side

Crumble the crispy prosciutto over the tortelloni and sprinkle over the remaining grated cheese – this is your prosciutto & asparagus sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Garnish with a generous grind of black pepper and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
