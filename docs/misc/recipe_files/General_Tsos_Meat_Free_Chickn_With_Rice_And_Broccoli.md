Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, chop your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem and leaves

Cut a<span class="text-danger"> </span>piece (or two!) of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Lay the broccoli florets in the middle with your toasted sesame oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and a pinch of salt and add to a baking tray

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the broccoli to form a sealed parcel[s] and put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until tender

Once the meat-free chick'n is golden, transfer it to a plate and set aside for later

Carefully pour away most of the oil and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the maple syrup sauce and cook for 1 min

### Step 7

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, return the golden meat-free chick'n to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the meat-free chick'n has warmed through – this is your General Tso's meat-free chick'n

### Step 8

Serve the General Tso's meat-free chick'n over the cooked rice with the broccoli to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
