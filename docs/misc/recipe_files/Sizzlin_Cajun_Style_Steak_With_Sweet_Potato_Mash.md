## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Combine your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and ground cumin to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Cajun-style spice mix

Add your rump steak[s] to the Cajun-style spice mix and rub until fully coated


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the seasoned steak[s]

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once done, transfer the steak to a clean plate to rest – this is your Cajun-style steak


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your sugar snap peas on the diagonal and add them to a heat-proof bowl

Cover the chopped sugar snap peas in boiled water and set aside for 7-8 min or until softened slightly

Once done, drain and return them to the bowl


### Step 6

While the steak is resting, add your soy sauce to the pan with a splash of boiled water and cook for 1 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your sauce


### Step 7

Add a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt to the drained sweet potato and mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash

### Step 8

Pour any resting juices into the sauce

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board, then serve it with the sweet potato mash and sugar snap peas to the side

Crumble over your feta and spoon the sauce over everything

Enjoy!
