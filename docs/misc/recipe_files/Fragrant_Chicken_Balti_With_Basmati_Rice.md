## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


### Step 3

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 5

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock


### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your ginger paste to the pan

Add your garam masala, ground paprika, crushed cardamom pod[s], ground coriander and ground cumin with a knob of butter and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the chopped chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken has browned

Add the chicken stock and your chopped tomatoes with a pinch of sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your fragrant chicken balti

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant chicken balti with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!
