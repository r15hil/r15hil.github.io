## Ingredients

- Basil (5g) x0
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Basa fillet x0
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Parsley (5g) x0
- Basil (10g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Parsley (10g)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and cut your waxy potatoes into small, bite-sized pieces

Add them to a pot, cover with boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring back to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with the halved cherry tomatoes

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Chop your parsley and basil roughly, including the stalks

Cut your lemon[s] in half, then slice off 1 wedge per person and set aside for garnish


### Step 5

Add the chopped garlic, parsley and basil to a pestle & mortar and grind to a coarse paste

Grate your cheddar cheese directly into the mortar and continue to grind together to make a paste

Drizzle over enough olive oil to loosen the mix, then add a squeeze of lemon juice and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pesto

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!


### Step 6

Drain the cooked potatoes and leave them to steam-dry for 5 min

Tip: This allows the potatoes to dry out, making them perfect for mashing later!


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to the pot with a generous squeeze of lemon juice, a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon mash

### Step 8

Serve the baked basa over the lemon mash with the cherry tomatoes to the side

Drizzle a little pesto over the fish and serve the rest to the side

Garnish with a reserved lemon wedge

Enjoy!
