### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into quarters

Add the pepper quarters to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) (hollow side of the pepper facing up)

### Step 3

Combine your toasted sesame oil and half of your gluten free soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar, ground coriander, a knob of butter and a grind of black pepper – this is your sesame marinade

Add your chicken thighs to the sesame marinade and give it a mix up, then top each pepper quarter with a marinated chicken thigh and put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet sesame chicken thigh & charred pepper

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Add your white long grain rice, hoisin sauce, Chinese rice wine, ginger & garlic paste and the remaining gluten free soy sauce to the pot and give everything a good mix up

### Step 5

Add your chicken stock mix with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the rice is cooked, stir the spinach through until wilted and give everything a good mix up  – this is your hoisin rice

### Step 8

To serve, top the hoisin rice with the sweet sesame chicken thighs & charred pepper

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and drizzle over any remaining juices from the chicken
