## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 80g cheddar cheese
- 6 plain tortillas
- 400g canned black beans
- 20g chipotle paste
- 1 carrot
- 300g portobello mushrooms
- 1 apple
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 spring onion
- 8ml soy sauce
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the portobello mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until starting to soften and brown

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans


### Step 2

Once browned, add the smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further

Reduce the heat to medium, add the drained black beans, soy sauce and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water

Cover with a lid and cook for 10-12 min or until the mushrooms are cooked through


### Step 3

Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Once the mushrooms are cooked, transfer them to a clean board and shred  apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mash the cooked black beans until smooth – these are your refried beans


### Step 5

Add the grated cheese and pulled mushrooms to the refried beans and give everything a good mix up – this is your mushroom & black bean mix

Divide the mushroom & black bean mix between the tortilla wraps

Fold each tortilla wrap over so you're left with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> half moon-shaped sandwiches


### Step 6

Add the filled tortilla wraps to a baking tray

Place a second baking tray on top of the tortilla baking tray to weigh it down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 15 min or until the tortillas are slightly browned and the cheese is melted – these are your mushroom & black bean quesadillas


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash, trim and finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then slice the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

In a bowl combine the grated carrot, grated apple, sliced spring onion, a good squeeze of lime and a pinch of salt – this is your zesty slaw

Combine the mayo and chipotle paste – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 8

Once done, leave the mushroom & black bean quesadillas to cool slightly and the cheese to set

Once cooled, slice the quesadillas into triangles

Serve the zesty slaw and the chipotle mayo to the side

Enjoy!
