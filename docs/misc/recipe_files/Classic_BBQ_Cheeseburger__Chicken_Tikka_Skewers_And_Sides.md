### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Soak the skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning when cooking)

Add each sweetcorn cobette to a piece of tin foil with a small knob of butter and wrap them up tightly until fully sealed

Put the sweetcorn cobettes in the oven for 25 min or until tender and cooked through

### Step 2

Boil a kettle and cut the waxy potatoes in half

Tip: Cut some lengthways and some widthways for a more interesting texture!

Add the chopped waxy potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until tender, then drain and set aside to steam dry

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> of the Greek-style yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl with the curry powder, the juice of 1/4<span class="text-danger"> [1/2]</span> lemon and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tikka marinade

Cut each chicken breast into 4 even strips

Add the chicken strips to the tikka marinade and stir it all together

### Step 4

Thread 2 marinated chicken strips onto each skewer in a snake-like fashion and set aside

Add the beef mince to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly with your hands until fully combined

Divide the beef mince mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into patties

### Step 5

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Chop the root<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the lettuce, separate the leaves and give them a wash, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Cut the brioche buns in half

Trim, then slice the spring onions finely

Combine the sliced spring onion with the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon and the remaining yoghurt in a large bowl – this is your potato salad dressing

### Step 6

Add the chicken tikka skewers to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray

Add the burger patties to the other side

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min

Add the cooked potatoes to the potato salad dressing and season with a pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper – this is your potato salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1626187522027-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop the cheddar cheese into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12]</span> slices

Once the chicken skewers and burger patties have had 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and top the burgers with the sliced cheese

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 3-4 min further or until everything's cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the brioche halves to the oven for 3-4 min until warmed through

### Step 8

Spread each brioche base with some mustard ketchup, then top with a lettuce leaf, cheesy patty, some tomato slices and the brioche lid

Serve the cheeseburgers with the chicken skewers, potato salad, sweetcorn cobettes and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with some olive oil and squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon
