## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) half your garlic (save the rest for later!)

Combine the chopped garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with your garam masala, beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!), then divide equally and shape into 6 meatballs per person


### Step 2

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool, then once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

Chop your green chilli in half

Crush the remaining garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skins


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned


### Step 5

Reboil half a kettle

Add the wilted spinach and half the green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a food processor with the crushed garlic, ginger paste, curry powder and most of your coriander (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your saag paste


### Step 6

Once the meatballs are browned, add the saag paste and tomato paste to the pan

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your beef stock mix to the pan with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), stirring occasionally – these are your spicy saag gosht-style beef meatballs

Slice the remaining green chilli into rounds

### Step 8

Serve the spicy saag gosht-style beef meatballs with the cooked rice to the side

Drizzle over your yoghurt and dollop on your mango chutney

Top with the reserved coriander leaves and the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
