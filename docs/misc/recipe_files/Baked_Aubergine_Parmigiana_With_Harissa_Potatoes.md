## Ingredients

- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g) x2
- Baharat (1tsp)
- Aubergine
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)

- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Roasted garlic paste (15g)
- Harissa paste (20g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, then without cutting through the stalk[s], carefully slice the halved aubergine into strips, lengthways (at approx. 1cm intervals)

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Combine your chopped tomatoes and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water in an oven-proof dish (or two!) with your vegetable stock mix, baharat, roasted garlic paste and a pinch of salt

Top with the sliced aubergine

Put the dish[es] in the oven and cook for an initial 40 min or until the aubergine is very tender and the sauce is bubbling – this is your spiced aubergine


### Step 5

Add the halved potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Once the spiced aubergine has had 10 min, put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

After the initial 40 min, remove the aubergine from the oven and top with the grated cheese and half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Return the dish[es] to the oven for 5 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your baked aubergine parmigiana


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and mix everything together – these are your harissa potatoes

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the baked aubergine parmigiana with the salad and harissa potatoes to the side

Drizzle your red wine vinegar and a little olive oil over the salad

Dig in!
