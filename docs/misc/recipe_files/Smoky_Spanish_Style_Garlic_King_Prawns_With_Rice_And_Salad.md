## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil over medium heat

Chop your tomatoes into wedges


### Step 3

Once hot, add the tomato wedges and roasted garlic paste and cook for 1 min


### Step 4

Combine your red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl  – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 6

While the rice is in the microwave, add your ground smoked paprika to the tomatoes with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste and cook for 30 secs further

Increase the heat to medium-high, drain then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally until cooked through

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 7

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Once the prawns are cooked, add a small splash of water with a generous pinch of salt and sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Give everything a good mix up until a sauce has formed and top with the chopped parsley – these are your smoky Spanish-style garlic king prawns

Toss the salad in the dressing – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the smoky Spanish-style garlic king prawns with the cooked rice and salad to the side

Enjoy!
