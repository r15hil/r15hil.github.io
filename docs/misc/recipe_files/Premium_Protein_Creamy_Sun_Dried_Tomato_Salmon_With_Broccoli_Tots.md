## Ingredients

- Basil (5g)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Skin on salmon fillets (2pcs)
- British free range egg
- Broccoli

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high and boil a full kettle

Cut your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem[s] and leaves

Add the broccoli florets to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 5-6 min or until tender


### Step 2

While the broccoli is boiling, add your panko breadcrumbs, grated Italian hard cheese and crack your egg[s] to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your breadcrumb mixture

Chop your sun-dried tomatoes roughly


### Step 3

Drain and rinse the cooked broccoli under cold running water

Once cooled, add the rinsed broccoli to a chopping board and chop as finely as you can

Tip: Alternatively add it to a food processor!

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 4

Add the chopped broccoli to the bowl with the breadcrumb mixture and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Shape into 3 patties per person – these are your broccoli tots

Add the broccoli tots to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!)

Place the tray[s] under the grill for 10 min or until cooked through and crispy

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your soft cheese, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up then set aside to infuse – this is your creamy tomato stock


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Season your salmon fillet[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and once hot add to the pan (skin-side down) and cook for 5 min on one side


### Step 7

Flip the salmon so it’s skin-side up, then add the creamy tomato stock to the pan and cook for a final 5-6 min, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Tear most of the basil (save a little for garnish!) into the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato salmon

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the broccoli tots with the salmon to the side

Drizzle the creamy sun-dried tomato sauce over the salmon and season with a generous crack of black pepper

Sprinkle over the remaining basil

Enjoy!
