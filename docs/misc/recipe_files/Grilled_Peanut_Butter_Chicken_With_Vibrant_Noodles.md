### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high

Boil a kettle

Combine your peanut butter, half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), the juice of half your lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> brown sugar in a bowl and mix to combine – this is your lime & peanut marinade

### Step 2

Add your chicken breast strips to the lime & peanut marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your peanut butter chicken

Add the peanut butter chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and drizzle any remaining marinade over the chicken

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min, turning once, or until the chicken is cooked through and beginning to char (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-size pieces

Add your medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped peppers and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 5

While the peppers are softening, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 6

Once the peppers have softened, add the sliced garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until softened

Drain the noodles reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water

Add the drained noodles to the pan with the reserved noodle water, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min further

### Step 7

Take the pan off the heat and add in the juice of the remaining lime and the remaining soy sauce

Mix everything together so the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – these are your vibrant noodles

### Step 8

Serve the vibrant noodles in bowls with the grilled peanut butter chicken on top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
