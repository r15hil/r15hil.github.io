### Step 1

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat 

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked 

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

### Step 5

Combine the hoisin sauce, rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your hoisin sauce

Once the pork is cooked, reduce the heat to low and add the hoisin sauce to the pan

Cook for a further 1 min, turning the pork steaks several times until they're nicely coated

Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to rest for a couple of min – these are your Taiwanese-style pork steaks

### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with the toasted sesame oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, spinach, sliced garlic, and chopped ginger with a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and cook, covered for 3-4 min or until tender – these are your sesame greens

Roughly chop the peanuts (or bash them in their bag!)

### Step 8

Serve the rested Taiwanese-style pork steaks over the cooked rice with the sesame greens to the side

Drizzle over any remaining hoisin sauce from the pan and garnish with the sliced spring onion and chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
