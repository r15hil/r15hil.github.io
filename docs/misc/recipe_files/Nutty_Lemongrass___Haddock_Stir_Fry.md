## Ingredients

- 150g rice noodles
- 1 bag of roasted peanuts (25g)
- 1 red chilli
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 soy sauce sachet (30ml)
- 25g solid coconut cream
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk
- 1 British free-range egg
- 150g spring greens
- 200g haddock bites
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of the lemongrass and set aside, then chop the softer inner core roughly

Peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic and ginger

Slice half of the red chilli into rounds and roughly chop the remaining chilli


### Step 2

Remove 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> outer leaves from the spring greens and add them to a large dish with the lemongrass outer layers

Add the rice noodles and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain and set aside


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the chopped ginger, garlic, lemongrass and chopped red chilli (save the rounds for garnish!) to a food processor with the ground turmeric, soy sauce, half the peanuts and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Blitz to a rough paste – this is your nutty lemongrass paste


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the nutty lemongrass paste  to the pan and cook for 3-4 mins until fragrant

Meanwhile, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly, then dissolve it in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the haddock bites and coconut stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min until the fish is cooked through

While the fish is cooking, rip the remaining leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 6

Once the fish is cooked, add the sliced spring greens and drained rice noodles and cook for 1-2 min further until the sauce starts to stick to the noodles


### Step 7

Push the rice noodles to one side of the pan and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the other side

Stir the egg<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with a wooden spoon to break the yolk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then gently mix it through the rice noodles – this is your nutty lemongrass & haddock stir-fry

### Step 8

Lay a spring green leaf on the base of each bowl

Top with the nutty lemongrass & haddock stir-fry, remaining peanuts and chilli rounds

Enjoy!
