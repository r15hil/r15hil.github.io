### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces

Crush half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>garlic (you'll use the rest later!) open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

### Step 2

Cut<span class="text-danger"> </span>a piece of tin foil (or two!) approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and lay out

Add the chopped pepper to the middle with the crushed garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the pepper to form a sealed parcel[s] and add to one side of a baking tray

### Step 3

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to other side of the baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the pepper has softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic and chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine your panko breadcrumbs in a bowl with half the chopped parsley, half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby breadcrumb mixture

Combine the chopped garlic and mayo in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of cold water – this is your aioli

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1644933422924-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper, then add to a separate, baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), and season with a pinch of salt

Spread a dollop of the aioli on the fish and sprinkle the herby breadcrumb mixture on top

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your herb-crusted basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

After an initial 15 min, remove the parcel[s] from the oven

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook the potatoes for a further 5-10 min or until golden and crisp

While the potatoes are in the oven, add the softened pepper, garlic, remaining ground smoked paprika, flaked almonds and the juice of half your lemon[s] to a food processor

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until you have a coarse paste – this is your romesco sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1644933427820-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once golden, add the cooked potatoes to a pot over a medium heat with the romesco sauce, spinach and the remaining chopped parsley

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has warmed through – these are your romesco potatoes

Slice the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the herb-crusted basa with the romesco potatoes and a dollop of aioli to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
