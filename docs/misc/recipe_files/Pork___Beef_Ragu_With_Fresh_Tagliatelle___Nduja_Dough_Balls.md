## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the dough ball bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork & beef mince with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Once the mince has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot with your bay leaf[ves] and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock mix and red wine stock paste to the pot with 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min – this is your pork & beef ragu


### Step 4

Add your ‘Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small pot over a medium heat and cook for 4-5 min or until crisp

Once crisp, add a knob of butter, remaining chopped garlic, half the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and set aside till serving – this is your ‘Nduja garlic butter


### Step 5

Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut into 5<span class="text-danger"> </span>pieces per person

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour, rounding each ball as you go (no need to knead!)


### Step 6

Remove the baking tray[s] from the oven and add the dough balls (be careful the tray[s] will be hot!)

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min or until the dough balls are puffed up and browned


### Step 7

After 20 min, remove the ragu from the oven and add your fresh tagliatelle, then return the pot to the oven, covered, for a further 6-8 min or until the pasta is cooked with a slight bite and the meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork & beef ragu with fresh tagliatelle

Remove the bay leaf[ves]

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings, then grate any remaining Italian hard cheese

### Step 8

Serve the pork & beef ragu with fresh tagliatelle topped with the grated Italian hard cheese and remaining chopped parsley

Brush the dough balls with the ‘Nduja garlic butter and serve to the side with the salad

Dress the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle olive oil and garnish with the Italian hard cheese shavings

Enjoy!
