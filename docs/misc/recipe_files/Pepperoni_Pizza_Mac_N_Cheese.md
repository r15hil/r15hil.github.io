## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the macaroni and set aside until later, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> starchy pasta water


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 4

Gradually whisk 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> milk, the reserved starchy pasta water and your chicken stock mix into the roux, and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once thickened, stir through the grated cheddar and half the torn mozzarella (save the rest for later!)

Season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your cheese sauce


### Step 5

Combine your panko breadcrumbs, remaining chopped garlic, dried oregano and tomato paste in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil – these are your tomatoey breadcrumbs


### Step 6

Once the cheese sauce has thickened, add the macaroni and mix it all together – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to an oven-proof dish and top with the remaining torn mozzarella, sliced pepperoni and tomatoey breadcrumbs

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your pepperoni pizza mac 'n' cheese


### Step 7

While the mac 'n' cheese is in the oven, wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your dressing

Add the salad and halved cherry tomatoes to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad


### Step 8

Serve the pepperoni pizza mac 'n' cheese with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
