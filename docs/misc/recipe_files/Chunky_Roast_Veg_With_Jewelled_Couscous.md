### Step 3

Add the chopped pepper, onion quarters, chopped courgette and chopped carrot to a large baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the veg is tender and starting to colour – this is your chunky roast veg

### Step 4

While the veg is in the oven, boil half a kettle

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Chop your dried cranberries finely

Peel and grate (or very finely chop) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your ground turmeric and ras el hanout and cook for 1 min, or until fragrant – this is your spiced oil

### Step 6

Add the drained chickpeas, chopped cranberries and grated garlic to the spiced oil and stir well to ensure everything is evenly coated

Add your couscous and vegetable stock to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Remove the pan from the heat and cover with a lid, then set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed and the couscous has softened

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your flaked almonds to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min, or until they have darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 8

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork, then add your cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your jewelled couscous

Add the chunky roast veg and toasted flaked almonds to the jewelled couscous then give everything a good mix up and serve

Enjoy!
