## Description

Sweet seasonal English pear and salty, crumbly Danish Blue cheese isnâ€™t a flavour combination exclusive to the cheeseboard. Pork steaks can handle big, melted blue cheese flavours too: think of the cheese as both a seasoning and a sauce. A seriously simple, tasty midweek traybake!
