### Step 1

Smash your cucumber with a rolling pin then chop it into large, bite-sized pieces

Tip: By bruising the cucumber the water is drawn out more easily

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Combine the smashed cucumber and grated carrot in a medium bowl with a pinch of salt and set aside

### Step 2

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 5-6 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add your soy sauce and honey and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your bulgogi

### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain any excess water from the smashed cucumber and grated carrot

Return the drained veg to the bowl and add your rice vinegar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled veg

### Step 6

Transfer the bulgogi to a bowl and return the pan (no need to wash it!) to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Boil a kettle

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and white miso paste with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of cold water in a bowl – this is your spicy miso sauce

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze any excess water out of the spinach then combine with your sesame oil

### Step 8

Add the cooked rice to a bowl and arrange the bulgogi, sesame spinach and quick-pickled veg on top

Top with a fried egg and a drizzle of the spicy miso sauce – this is you Korean-style beef bibimbap with smashed cucumber

Enjoy!
