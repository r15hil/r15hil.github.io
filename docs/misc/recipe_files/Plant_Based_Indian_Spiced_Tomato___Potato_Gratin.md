## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and sprinkle them with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened


### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the oven, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to caramelise


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic and chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once the onion has slightly caramelised, add the sliced garlic, chopped cherry tomatoes and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has softened, then transfer to a plate and set aside – this is your chilli tomato mixture

Reserve the pan


### Step 4

While the mixture is cooking, slice your tomatoes into rounds

Preheat the grill to very high


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add your ground coriander and cumin seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add your creamy single soy gradually to the roux with your vegetable stock mix and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly thickened – this is your spiced cream


### Step 6

Once the potatoes have softened, layer the sliced potatoes and the chilli tomato mixture in an oven-proof dish

Pour the spiced cream all over and top with the tomato rounds

Add a pinch of salt and put the dish under the grill for 8-10 min or until bubbling – this is your plant-based Indian spiced tomato & potato gratin


### Step 7

While the gratin is in the oven, dice your cucumber

Bash your roasted peanuts roughly with a rolling pin

Combine the diced cucumber, bashed peanuts and nigella seeds in a bowl with the juice from your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and a small drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your nutty cucumber salad

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the plant-based Indian spiced tomato & potato gratin with the nutty cucumber salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
