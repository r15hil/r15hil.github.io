### Step 6

Once the meatballs are brown, add the remaining chopped garlic, chopped tomato, dried oregano and dried basil to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork & olive meatball sauce

### Step 7

Once done, add the cooked spaghetti to the pork & olive meatball sauce with half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your pork & olive meatballs with creamy tomato spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water if the pasta is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the pork & olive meatballs with creamy tomato spaghetti and garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
