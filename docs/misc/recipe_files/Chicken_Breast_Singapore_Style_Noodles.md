## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pat your chicken breast portion[s] dry with kitchen paper and season generously on both sides with salt

Add the chicken breast portions to a baking tray and drizzle with vegetable oil (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Trim, then slice your green beans finely

Slice your button mushrooms finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and green beans and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for a further 2-3 min


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add the chopped ginger, ground turmeric and curry powder to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until tender, then drain


### Step 7

Once drained, toss the noodles in your toasted sesame oil, then add them to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your Singapore-style noodles

Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and slice finely

### Step 8

Serve the Singapore-style noodles and top with the sliced chicken breast

Enjoy!
