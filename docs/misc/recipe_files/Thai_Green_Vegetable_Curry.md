- 2 whole star anise
- 3 kaffir lime leaves
- 15g fresh root ginger

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Peel and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-size pieces, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Cut the broccoli into small florets and cut the stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-size pieces


Slice the mushrooms finely


### Step 2

Heat a wide-based pan with a matching lid (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil


Once hot, add the carrots and broccoli stems (leave the florets for later), cover and leave to cook for approx. 5-8 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered


### Step 4

Remove the coconut cream from the sachet and chop roughly


Dissolve&nbsp;the chopped coconut cream and the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water


Crumble the kaffir lime leaves&nbsp;into the stock - this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Cut the chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways (can't handle the heat? scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon and discard)&nbsp;then slice finely


Stir&nbsp;the curry paste, star anise, ginger and red chilli (cant handle the heat? Go easy!) into the carrot pan and cook for 1 min


### Step 6

Add the coconut stock to the pan and stir to dissolve the curry paste


Add the broccoli florets and sliced mushrooms


Cover and cook for a further 3 min or until the broccoli is cooked through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the basil finely including the stalks, keeping a small handful of leaves aside for garnish


Fluff the cooked rice and stir in the toasted sesame oil and basil stalks

### Step 8

Serve the Thai vegetable curry in bowls,&nbsp;over the rice and garnish with the remaining basil leaves


Enjoy!
