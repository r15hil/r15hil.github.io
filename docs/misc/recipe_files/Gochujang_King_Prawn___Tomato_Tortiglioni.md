## Ingredients

- Spring greens (150g)
- Raw peeled king prawns (85g) x0
- Gochujang paste (30g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (20g)
- Raw peeled king prawns (171g)
- Tortiglioni (200g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Tomato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs and cook for 3-4 min or until golden, then transfer to a bowl and set aside

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Reserve the pan


### Step 2

While the breadcrumbs are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Roughly chop your tomato[es]


### Step 3

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and set aside until later

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chopped tomato with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 5

Once the tomato is softened, add your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs, or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce begins to thicken


### Step 6

Once slightly thickened, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min further or until cooked through

Wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 7

Once the prawns are cooked, stir through your soft cheese, sliced spring greens and a knob of butter and cook for 3-4 min or until the spring greens are tender with a bite

Once done, add the cooked tortiglioni – this is your gochujang king prawn & tomato tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the gochujang king prawn & tomato tortiglioni in a bowl and sprinkle over the golden panko breadcrumbs

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
