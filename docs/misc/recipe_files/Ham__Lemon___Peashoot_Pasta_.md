## Description

This summer pasta celebrates one of our favourite flavour combinations â€“ ham and pea. You'll cook up baby gammon until it's tender enough to pull apart. You'll then fold the shredded ham through a creamy mustard and lemon sauce. Finished with fresh peas, pea shoots and black pepper. Peafect!

### Step 5

Once the baby gammon&nbsp;is done, transfer it to a board and shred it, using two forks &ndash; this technique is known as 'pulling'&nbsp;


Tip: if you don't want to pull the gammon, simply cut it up into bite-size pieces!
