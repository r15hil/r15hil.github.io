## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Slice your bread roll[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the bread roll is toasting, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges


### Step 4

Once hot, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan with the sliced courgette, tomato wedges and your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min


### Step 5

Add your tomato paste, roasted garlic paste and Chinese rice wine with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your jumbo prawn saganaki

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 6

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks


### Step 7

Crumble your feta

### Step 8

Serve the jumbo prawn saganaki with the toasted bread roll to the side

Garnish with the crumbled feta and chopped parsley

Enjoy!
