### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layer[s] and discard, then chop the softer inner core[s] in half

Peel your garlic and shallot[s] and chop in half

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Add the garlic, shallot halves, lemongrass, half the mint leaves and half your coriander (save the rest for later!) to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped – this is your lemongrass paste

### Step 3

Once blitzed, combine the lemongrass paste, lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and soy sauce in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemongrass lean pork mince

Divide and shape the lemongrass lean pork mince into one burger patty per person

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lemongrass patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Reduce the heat to medium-high, flip the patty[ies] and cook for a further 5 min or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

While the patty[ies] is cooking, peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons to a bowl with your rice vinegar and give everything a good mix up and set aside – these are your quick-pickled carrot ribbons

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

### Step 6

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the halved ciabatta[s] to a baking tray (cut side up) and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

### Step 7

Combine your red chilli relish and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sweet chilli mayo

### Step 8

Top the base of the toasted ciabatta with some sweet chilli mayo, the remaining coriander and mint, a lemongrass patty and the quick-pickled carrot ribbons then top with the ciabatta lid

Serve with the chips to the side and drizzle over the remaining sweet chilli mayo, then top with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
