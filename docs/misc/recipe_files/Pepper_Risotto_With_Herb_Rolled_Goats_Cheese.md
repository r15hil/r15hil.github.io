### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to a baking tray with your cherry tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min

Whilst the veg is in the oven, boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1.2L]</span> boiled water

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened

Add the chopped garlic and arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in oil

### Step 4

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs then add your tomato paste, red wine vinegar and 1/3 of your vegetable stock stirring continuously until it's absorbed

Continue to add the remaining vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring more or less continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Grind some black pepper over the chopped parsley

Roll your goats' cheese in the parsley and black pepper until fully coated, then set aside for later – this is your herb-rolled goats' cheese

Carefully chop the roasted pepper and add it to the risotto with a pinch of sugar
