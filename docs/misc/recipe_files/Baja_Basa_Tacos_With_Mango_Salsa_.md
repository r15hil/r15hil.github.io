### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tip: This is to warm your tortillas later – alternatively, add them to a plate and pop in the microwave

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper

Cut the fillets at an angle, leaving 3 equally sized pieces

### Step 2

Add the soy sauce and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate and mix it all together

Add the sliced basa to the spice plate and give everything a good mix up until fully coated, then set aside

Add 60g <span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour, the white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt to a separate bowl with 80ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>very cold water and mix thoroughly, then set aside for later – this is your batter

### Step 3

Top, tail and peel the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Stand the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone

### Step 4

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Combine in a bowl the diced mango, chopped green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), diced tomato and sliced spring onion with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your mango salsa

### Step 5

Add a handful of flour to the sliced basa and give everything a good mix up until they are fully coated in the flour

Dip the floured basa in the batter (turn several times to coat completely)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the battered basa to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1592916643673-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the tortillas to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Add the battered basa to the warmed tortillas and top with the mango salsa

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
