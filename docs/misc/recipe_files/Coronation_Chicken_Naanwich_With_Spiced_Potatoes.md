### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop the waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and leave them to steam dry

### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add chopped ginger, chopped garlic, curry powder, natural yoghurt, mango chutney, soy sauce and chicken thighs to an oven-proof dish and stir everything together

### Step 3

Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, then sprinkle over the garam masala and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – these are your spiced potatoes

Put both the potato tray and the chicken dish in the oven for 25-35 min or until the potatoes are crispy, the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

### Step 4

While the potatoes and chicken are cooking, reboil half a kettle

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Wash the gem lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper then shred it<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Toss the grated carrot and shredded lettuce in a bowl – this is your salad

Add the sultanas to another bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside for later

### Step 5

Once the chicken thighs are cooked, carefully shred the meat apart with two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Tip: Return the dish to the oven for 5 min further if the sauce still needs to thicken!

Drain the soaked sultanas and add them to the pulled chicken, giving everything a good mix up – this is your coronation chicken

### Step 6

When the potatoes are almost done, push them to one side of the baking tray and add the naans to the other side

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to use 2 trays!

Put into the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Meanwhile, cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>large pieces of tin foil

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1595941076752-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Lay each warmed naan onto a piece of foil

Add the coronation chicken lengthways down the middle of each naan, then top with the salad

Fold the naan around the filling, widthways, then wrap each 'naanwich' in the piece of foil – this is your coronation chicken naanwich

### Step 8

Serve the coronation chicken naanwich with the spiced potatoes and any remaining salad to the side

Enjoy!
