### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>then top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and carrot and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and starting to caramelise

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skins on) as thinly as you can

Add the sliced potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until just cooked (this is known as 'parboiling')

Once done, drain the sliced potatoes and leave them to steam dry

### Step 3

Once the onion and carrot have softened, add your lamb mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Reboil half a kettle

Strip your thyme leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks

### Step 4

Once the lamb has started to brown, stir in 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Stir in your tomato paste, Henderson's Relish, onion marmalade, bay leaf[ves] and half of the chopped thyme (you'll use the rest later!)

Cook for 1 min and stir it all together to combine

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/956.-956.__step-5-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add the beef stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lamb mixture

Add the lamb mixture to an oven-proof dish (reserve the pan for later)

### Step 6

Layer the drained sliced potatoes on top, dot them with a few knobs of butter and sprinkle with the remaining chopped thyme

Put the dish on a baking tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are brown and crispy and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Lancashire-style lamb hotpot

Once the Lancashire-style lamb hotpot is done, remove it from the oven and set aside to cool a little (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

### Step 7

Wash your spring greens, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and a small splash of water and cook for 2-3 min or until bright green and wilted – these are your wilted greens

### Step 8

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Serve the Lancashire-style lamb hotpot with the wilted greens to the side

Enjoy!
