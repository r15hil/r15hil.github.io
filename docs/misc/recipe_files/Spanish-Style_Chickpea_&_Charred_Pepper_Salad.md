### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano all over, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the onion wedges and tomato wedges with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to one side of a separate baking tray (or two!) and set aside for later

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli

### Step 6

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped peppers and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – these are your charred peppers

### Step 7

Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Divide the rocket between the plates and top with the crispy potatoes, roasted onion & tomato wedges, paprika chickpeas and charred peppers – this is your Spanish-style chickpea & charred pepper salad

Drizzle the spicy aioli all over

Enjoy!
