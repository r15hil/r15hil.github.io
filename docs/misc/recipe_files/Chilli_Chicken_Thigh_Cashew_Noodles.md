### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until almost cooked

### Step 3

While the noodles are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and diced chicken thigh, then cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown

### Step 4

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half (chop it in one bunch for speed!)

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the chopped spring onion and cook for a further 6-7 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

When the noodles are almost cooked, add your halved Tenderstem broccoli and cook for 2 min further or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the noodles & Tenderstem broccoli and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water

Meanwhile, add your cornflour to a bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and stir to dissolve

Add your sriracha, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce and tomato ketchup

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil with a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli sauce

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, add the drained noodles & Tenderstem broccoli, chilli sauce and cashew nuts and stir it all together – these are your chilli chicken cashew noodles

Tip: Add another splash of the starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve up your chilli chicken thigh cashew noodles and let everyone tuck in

Enjoy!
