### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, then cook for a further 3 min
