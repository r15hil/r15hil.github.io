### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

Once the meat-free sausage[s] have had 17-18 min remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add your cut hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the hot dog buns are warmed through

### Step 8

Fill the hot dog bun with a meat-free hot dog, then top with your crispy onions and some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw and sriracha mayo

Serve the remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw and fiery sesame fries to the side

Drizzle the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo and top with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
