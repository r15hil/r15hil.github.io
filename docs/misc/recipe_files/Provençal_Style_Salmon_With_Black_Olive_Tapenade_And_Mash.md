## Description

'Piquant', or pleasantly sharp, are the only words for this baked salmon's bold tapenade topping and 'piperade' tomato sauce. Savoury, simple and distinctly South of France, this plate wouldn't be complete without a forkful of creamy, buttery mash with every bite.

## Ingredients

- Black olives (40g)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Tomato x2
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Skin on salmon fillets (2pcs)
- White potato x3
- Green pepper
- Garlic clove x2
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized chunks

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s] and chop your tomato[es] roughly

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, roughly chop your black olives

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper, chopped tomatoes and half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 3-4 min

Add your tomato paste, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper to the pan and cook, covered, for 15 min or until reduced to a stew-like consistency – this is your Provençal-style sauce


### Step 5

Grind the chopped black olives, remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a smooth paste (alternatively, pulse in a food processor until smooth)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your black olive tapenade


### Step 6

Line a baking tray with tin foil, then place your salmon fillet[s] on the tray (or two!), skin-side down

Divide and spread the black olive tapenade over the salmon

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 14-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your black olive tapenade baked salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of olive oil and a knob of butter

Season with salt and pepper and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Serve the black olive tapenade baked salmon with the mash and Provençal-style sauce to the side

Season with a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
