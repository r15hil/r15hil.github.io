Add the diced tomato to the bowl with the sliced onion with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato salad


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add your lamb mince

Cook for 3-4 min further or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Once the lamb is browned, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and curry powder and cook for 4 min further or until cooked through and fragrant (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Whilst the lamb is cooking, add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt (if you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything finely)

Grind to a fine paste, then add your mayo with the juice of 1/4 of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s]

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir it all together – this is your coriander chutney


### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the lamb is done, squeeze in the juice of 1/4 of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced lamb mince

Wash your lettuce, then dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Fill the warmed tortillas with the shredded lettuce, spiced lamb mince and tomato salad

Drizzle the coriander chutney all over and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
