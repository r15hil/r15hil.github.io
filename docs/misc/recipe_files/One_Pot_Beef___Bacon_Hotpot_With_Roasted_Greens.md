### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced beef and bacon lardons to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2 min or until lightly browned

### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skin on) into discs

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Peel and chop your shallot[s] in half

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into rounds

### Step 4

Add the crushed garlic, chopped shallot and carrot rounds to the dish

Add in your beef stock mix with your tomato paste, Henderson's Relish and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water then bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your beef & bacon mix

### Step 5

Once boiling, carefully arrange the potato discs over the top of the beef & bacon mix

Season with a grind of black pepper, dot with a couple of small knobs of butter, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

After 15 min, remove the lid, then return the dish to the oven for 45 min further or until the potatoes are golden and the meat is tender – this is your one pot beef & bacon hotpot

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

When the hotpot has 15 min left, cut 1 piece of tin foil approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper and add to a baking tray

Trim, then add your green beans and Tenderstem broccoli to the middle with a small knob of butter

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the veg to form a<span class="text-danger"> </span>sealed parcel[s], then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender – these are your roasted greens

### Step 8

Serve the one pot beef & bacon hotpot with the roasted greens to the side
