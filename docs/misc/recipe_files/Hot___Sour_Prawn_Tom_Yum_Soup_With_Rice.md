## Ingredients

- 1 Sriracha hot chilli sauce sachet (8ml)
- 80g baby button mushrooms
- 1 fish sauce sachet (15ml)
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 1 fresh lemongrass
- 130g basmati rice
- 5g coriander
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle<br /><br />Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin


Separate the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the softer inner core of the lemongrass and set aside for later


Chop the<span class="text-highlight"> softer inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></span> in half


### Step 2

Add the basmati rice, the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of the lemongrass and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

<span class="text-highlight">Add 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>boiled water to a pot over a medium heat with the chopped inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of the lemongrass and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat</span>


Cook for 2 min until fragrant


Meanwhile, slice the baby button mushrooms finely


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped ginger, garlic, and half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy?) to the pot and cook for 1 min further


Add the sliced baby button mushrooms, Sriracha and fish sauce and cook for 2 min or until the mushrooms have started to soften


### Step 6

<span class="text-highlight">While the mushrooms soften,</span> roughly chop the coriander, including the stalks<br /><br />Slice the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges<br /><br /><br />


### Step 7

Add the king prawns to the pot with the juice of 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> lime wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 3-4 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your <span class="text-highlight">prawn tom yum soup</span><br /><br />

### Step 8

Pack the lemongrass rice into small bowls and turn them out for a fancy presentation


Ladle over the <span class="text-highlight">prawn tom yum soup</span><br /><br />Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped coriander and lime wedges<br /><br />Enjoy!
