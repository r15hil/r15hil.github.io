## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp Italian balsamic vinegar
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 200g linguine 
- 80g chestnut mushrooms 
- 50g rocket salad 
- 40g Italian hard cheese
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves 
- 10g fresh sage 
- 2 British free range eggs

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Strip the sage&nbsp;leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely&nbsp;


Slice the portobello mushrooms finely


Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the sage leaves and cook them for 1 min or until they're crisp


Once crisp, transfer them to a plate (keep the pan with the oil!) and season them lightly with&nbsp;salt


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the sliced&nbsp;chestnut mushrooms and sliced&nbsp;portobello mushrooms with a big pinch of salt and cook them for 5-6 min or until the mushrooms have lightly browned


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until it's cooked with a slight bite


Once done reserve 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water, then drain the linguine


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic


Grate the Italian hard cheese


Crack the eggs&nbsp;into a shallow bowl and beat them with a fork


Add 3/4 of the&nbsp;grated cheese and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper - this is your&nbsp;cheesy egg mixture


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have browned, add the chopped shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, chopped garlic, chopped sage stalks and a knob of butter and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the shallots have softened


Meanwhile, add the balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a large bowl


Wash and dry the rocket, then add it to the bowl and mix - this is your rocket salad


### Step 7

Once the shallots have softened, remove the pan from the heat and add the drained linguine with a splash of starchy&nbsp;pasta water&nbsp;


Add the cheesy egg mixture and stir continuously for 30 sec-1 min or until the mixture has thickened ever so slightly, adding more pasta water if you need to loosen it a bit

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom carbonara&nbsp;


Garnish with the crispy sage leaves, the remaining grated cheese&nbsp;and serve&nbsp;the rocket salad to the side


Enjoy!
