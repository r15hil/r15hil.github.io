## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 1 courgette
- 50g soft cheese
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 100g British bacon lardons
- 80g spinach
- 200g conchiglie
- 5g mint
- 10g basil
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much of the water out of the cooled spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 2

Reboil the kettle

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Roughly chop the basil, including the stalks

Peel and roughly chop the garlic


### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), chopped spinach, most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and chopped mint to a food processor

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and blitz until smooth

Add the chicken stock mix, soft cheese and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blitz again – this is your mint & basil pesto


### Step 4

Top, tail and peel lengths off the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Chop the remaining courgette core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Add the conchiglie to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once the pasta is done, add the courgette ribbons to a sieve and drain the conchiglie over the courgette ribbons, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the bacon lardons and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crisp

Once golden, add the chopped courgette core to the pan and cook for 2 min further or until softened and caramelised


### Step 7

Add the drained conchiglie and courgette ribbons to the pan with the bacon lardons and the mint & basil pesto

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your mint & basil pesto, courgette & bacon conchiglie

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the mint & basil pesto, courgette & bacon conchiglie and sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
