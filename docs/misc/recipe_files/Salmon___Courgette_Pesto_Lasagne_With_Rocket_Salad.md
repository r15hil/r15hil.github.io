## Description

When in Rome, eat as the Romans do. This modern Italian classic is a festive favourite. You’ll swap Tuscan ragú for sautéed courgette and tender salmon flakes in a creamy béchamel sauce. Layer with lasagne and bake in the oven until golden before you plate up with a speedy rocket and Italian cheese salad.

## Ingredients

- Skin on salmon fillets (2pcs)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Lasagne sheets (120g)
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Traditional Italian pesto (45g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Courgette
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Heat a medium-sized pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the chopped courgette and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, transfer it to a large bowl and reserve the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, place your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, on a clean chopping board

Hold the tail end firmly and using a sharp knife, make a cut between the flesh and skin and continue to cut along the length of the fillet away from yourself until the skin comes away from the fillet, discard the skin

Tip: Keep your knife flat against the board to stop you from cutting through the skin!


### Step 3

Chop the skinless salmon fillet into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped salmon and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to the softened courgette with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your salmon & courgette mix


### Step 4

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 20g<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> [40g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 5

Remove the béchamel sauce from the heat

Add your pesto and vegetable stock mix to the pot with a pinch of salt and whisk everything together until well combined – this is your pesto béchamel

Peel half your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings (save the rest for later!)


### Step 6

Layer some of the salmon & courgette mix over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta, then top with some of the pesto béchamel

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of pesto béchamel

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish!

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese on top


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked – this is your salmon & courgette pesto lasagne

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the lasagne is nearly cooked, toss the rocket and the remaining balsamic vinegar in a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your rocket salad

### Step 8

Remove the salmon & courgette pesto lasagne from the oven and leave to stand for 5-10 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the rocket salad on the side and top with the cheese shavings

Enjoy!
