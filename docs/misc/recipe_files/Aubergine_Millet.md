## Description

For those unfamiliar with millet, let us take a millet to introduce you. It’s technically a seed, although it's far from seedy, as you’re most likely to find it in the ‘wholegrain’ aisle of a health food store. It’s brimming with B vitamins, fibre and minerals; so it’s a jammy little seed to have in your life.
