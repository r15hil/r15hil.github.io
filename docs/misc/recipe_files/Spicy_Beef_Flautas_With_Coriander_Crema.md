## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Tomato
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Soured cream (80g)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Lime
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop your garlic

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Once the beef has browned, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Add your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until the meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy beef filling


### Step 5

Divide the spicy beef filling evenly between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and add them to a baking tray (or two!), seam-side down

Drizzle with olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until beginning to crisp – these are your spicy beef flautas


### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and bash into a smooth paste

Stir the coriander paste through your soured cream with a squeeze of your lime[s] – this is your coriander crema

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the coriander very finely and mix with the salt and soured cream in a bowl!


### Step 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash, then chop your lettuce roughly

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the spicy beef flautas with the chopped lettuce and chopped tomato to the side

Drizzle over the coriander crema

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
