### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes, tomato wedges and onion wedges to a baking tray lined with tin foil (to avoid mess!)

Add the dried oregano with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25 min

### Step 5

Dip the flattened chicken in the lemon oil then coat with the breadcrumbs until both sides are well coated

After an initial 25 min, remove the tray[s] of vegetables from the oven and crush the cooked tomato wedges with the back of a fork

Pour over the chicken stock and top with the trimmed green beans

Return the tray to the oven for a final 12-15 min or until the beans are tender and the stock has reduced

### Step 7

While the chicken and vegetables are cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Once cooked, transfer the chicken Milanese to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing

Remove the vegetables from the oven and mix them all up until everything's coated in the tomatoey sauce – these are your tomatoey potatoes & green beans

### Step 8

Serve the tomatoey potatoes & green beans with the chicken Milanese to the side

Sprinkle over the chopped basil and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!
