## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop into thin matchsticks

Slice your cucumber[s] finely


### Step 3

Combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved

Add your red wine vinegar, ginger matchsticks and sliced cucumber and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick pickled vegetables


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and season them with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned on both sides

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic, tamari soy sauce, mirin, honey and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>boiled water

Cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened and is sticky in consistency


### Step 6

Whilst the sauce is thickening, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Slice your mangetout in half lengthways

Add the sliced mangetout to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once pulled, mix the pulled chicken into the pan juices – this is your pulled chicken breast teriyaki

Drain the pickled vegetables through a sieve

Drain your mangetout

### Step 8

Serve the pulled chicken breast teriyaki over the cooked rice, with the grated carrot, pickled vegetables and mangetout to the side

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
