Heat a large, wide-based pan or wok (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic, chopped pepper and mangetout and cook for 3-4 min or until the vegetables start to soften


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have softened, add the meat-free chick’n with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the meat-free chick'n is warmed through


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> cold water in a bowl
