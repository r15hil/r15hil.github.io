## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausages to the dish and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned all over


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your leek[s] into large chunks, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of the knife then remove the skins and chop roughly

Drain and rinse your butter beans


### Step 5

Add the chopped potato to the dish with the chopped leek and chopped garlic

Add the drained butter beans with your chicken stock mix, chopped tomatoes, dried thyme, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 6

Stir it all together and bring to the boil

Tip: Nestle the chopped potato into the stock as much as you can!

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min or until the potato is tender

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After an initial 30 min, remove from the dish from the oven and give everything a good mix up

Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, for a final 10-15 min or until the sauce has thickened and the sausages are cooked through – this is your one pot rustic sausage & butter bean stew

### Step 8

Serve the one pot rustic sausage & butter bean stew

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season to taste

Dig in!
