### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

While the mince is browning, boil a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 4

Once the mince has started to brown, add your tamarind paste and honey to the pan with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 4-5 min or until the mince has caramelised and is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky tamarind pork

### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a medium-sized pot with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and chopped tomato to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water and your soy sauce to the pot with your toasted sesame oil, Chinese rice wine and chicken stock mix and give everything a good mix up – this is your fragrant broth

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-41-1717065825424-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add your medium egg noodles to the fragrant broth, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 2-3 min, stirring frequently

After the initial 2-3 min, add your mangetout to the pot and cook for a further 3 min or until the noodles and the mangetout are tender with a slight bite – this is your noodle broth

### Step 8

Serve the noodle broth in bowls and top with the sticky tamarind pork

Garnish with the chopped spring onion and crispy onions

Enjoy!
