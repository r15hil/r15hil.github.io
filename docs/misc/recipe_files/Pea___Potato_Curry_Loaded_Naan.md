### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Chop your tomato[es] into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

### Step 7

While the curry is cooking, add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once thickened, remove the curry from the heat and stir through half your natural yoghurt (you’ll use the rest later!) – this is your pea & potato curry

### Step 8

To build, spread your mango chutney onto the warmed naan

Top with the pea & potato curry then dollop over the remaining natural yoghurt – this is your pea & potato curry loaded naan

Season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!
