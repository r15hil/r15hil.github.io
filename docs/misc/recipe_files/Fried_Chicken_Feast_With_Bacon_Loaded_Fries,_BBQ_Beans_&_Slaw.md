### Step 1

Before you start cooking take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your fries

### Step 2

Chop your chicken thighs in half

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine 30ml <span class="text-purple">[45ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60ml]</span> milk with half your cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) in a large bowl and add the chopped chicken thighs, 2/3 of the grated garlic and a generous pinch of salt – this is your marinated chicken

Tip: Don't worry if the mixture looks a little lumpy, it's meant to be!

### Step 3

While the chicken is marinating, chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives and half your soured cream in a small bowl with half of the remaining cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!), the remaining grated garlic, a splash of cold water and a grind of black pepper – this is your ranch dressing

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with the remaining soured cream and remaining cider vinegar – this is your slaw

### Step 4

Add your smoked streaky bacon to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min further or until golden and crispy

### Step 5

Add your cornflour to a large bowl with 40g <span class="text-purple">[60g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> flour, ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, ground coriander and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your spice mix

Add the marinated chicken to the spice mix and mix well until evenly coated – this is your coated chicken

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1699376213880-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once very hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the coated chicken to the pan

Cook for 7-8 min on each side or until golden and crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1699376217575-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Add the drained cannellini beans, BBQ sauce and a splash of cold water to a heatproof bowl

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through – these are your BBQ beans

Once the bacon is crispy, chop the cooked bacon roughly – this is your crispy bacon

### Step 8

Serve your fried chicken with the slaw, BBQ beans and fries to the side

Drizzle the ranch dressing over the fries and top with the crispy bacon

Enjoy!
