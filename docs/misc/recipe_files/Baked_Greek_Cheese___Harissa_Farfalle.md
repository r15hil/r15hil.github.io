## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 100g greek salad cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 20g harissa paste
- 0 farfalle
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 200g farfalle
- 80g spinach
- 1/2 cucumber
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into chunks

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add the chopped pepper and halved tomatoes

Add your dried thyme with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper


### Step 3

Give everything a good mix up, then nestle your Greek cheese in the centre of the vegetables

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 18-20 min or until the veg are tender and roasted

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl and a small pinch of pepper - this is your dressing

Add the sliced cucumber and baby leaf salad to the bowl with the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad


### Step 5

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and vegetable stock mix with the reserved starchy pasta water – this is your harissa stock


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are roasted, add the harissa stock and give everything a good mix up until well combined

Top with the cooked farfalle and spinach and return the dish to the oven for 3-5 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, remove the dish from the oven, season with a small pinch of salt and mix until fully combined – this is your baked Greek cheese & harissa farfalle

### Step 8

Serve the baked Greek cheese & harissa farfalle with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
