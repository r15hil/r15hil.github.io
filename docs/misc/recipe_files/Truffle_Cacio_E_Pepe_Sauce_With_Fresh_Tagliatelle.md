### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble in your chestnut mushrooms using your hands with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Once the mushrooms are beginning to soften, add your cracked black pepper and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further

### Step 6

Once melted, add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water to the sauce and give everything a good mix up

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) – this is your cacio e pepe sauce

Add the drained tagliatelle to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the tagliatelle is coated in the sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cacio e pepe sauce with fresh tagliatelle and drizzle over your truffle oil

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
