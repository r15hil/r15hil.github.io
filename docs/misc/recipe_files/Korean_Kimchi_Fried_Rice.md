### Step 1

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Heat a large, wide-base pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 5

Once fragrant, wash and add the spinach and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to wilt

Once wilted, add the gochujang, soy sauce, kimchi and toasted sesame oil and cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently until the gochujang has been fully incorporated

Remove from the heat until the rice is done

### Step 6

Once the rice is almost done, heat a separate medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the black and white sesame seeds to the centre of the pan and crack the eggs over them

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking 

Tip: Spoon some of the sesame seeds over the egg!

### Step 7

Once the rice is done, return the kimchi pan to a high heat and add the sticky rice

Cook for 2-3 min or until the rice has been completely coated in the sauce â€“ this is your kimchi fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the kimchi fried rice and top with a sesame fried egg

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
