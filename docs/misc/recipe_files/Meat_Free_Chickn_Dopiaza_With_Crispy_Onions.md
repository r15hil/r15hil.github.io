## Description

Legend has it, the dopiaza was born from a happy accident, when a chef added too many onions to a dish. To make your own, you'll prepare onion three ways: blitzed into a rich paste, cut into wedges and simmered with plant-based chicken and tomato, and as a crispy topping.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and very roughly chop your brown onion[s]

Add the chopped onion, curry powder, ground cumin and ground coriander to a food processor with a pinch of salt

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your dopiaza base


### Step 3

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Chop any larger meat-free chick'n pieces in half


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the dopiaza base and cook for 2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomato and onion wedges to the pan with the meat-free chick'n and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is beginning to soften


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your tomato paste – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Once the onions have started to soften, add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-6 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your meat-free chick'n dopiaza

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free chick'n dopiaza with the basmati rice to the side

Top with a dollop of your cultured coconut and your crispy onions

Garnish with your nigella seeds

Enjoy!
