### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the tofu into large chunks

### Step 3

Combine the tofu chunks and your ground smoked paprika in a bowl with your ground turmeric, cornflour and soy sauce

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your coated tofu

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – this is your tofu karaage

### Step 5

While the tofu is cooking, combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix with half your mayo and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your slaw

### Step 6

Combine your white miso paste and the remaining mayo in a bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar– this is your miso mayo dip

### Step 7

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the tofu karaage with your cooked rice, slaw and miso mayo dip to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Drizzle the toasted sesame oil over the rice and scatter your black sesame seeds over everything

Enjoy!
