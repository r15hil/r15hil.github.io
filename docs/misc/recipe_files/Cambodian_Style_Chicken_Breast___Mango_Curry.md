## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop, then peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Slice your lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into 4 wedges per person


### Step 2

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 3

Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered until serving

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Whilst the chicken is cooking, add your basil, chopped shallot, chopped ginger and half your green chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add in the chopped creamed coconut, the juice of half your lime wedges and blitz until finely chopped – this is your curry paste


### Step 5

Once the chicken is lightly browned, add the curry paste to the pan with your ground turmeric and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 5-6 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone!

Chop the mango flesh into small bite-sized pieces, discarding the stone[s]

Slice the remaining green chilli finely

### Step 8

Stir the chopped mango through the chicken curry and serve over the basmati rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with your nigella seeds, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!
