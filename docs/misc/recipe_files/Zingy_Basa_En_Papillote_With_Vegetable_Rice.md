- Brown long grain rice (130g)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Toasted sesame oil (10ml)

- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)

- Soy sauce (30ml)
- Mirin (30ml)
- Mirin (15ml) x0
- Sugar snap peas (80g)
- Spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 3

Combine the chopped ginger, mirin, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl and give it a good mix – this is your zingy marinade


### Step 4

Cut 2 A3 size sheets of baking paper (or tin foil) per person

Lay each basa fillet in the centre of the 2 sheets (doubling it up prevents any leakages!) and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Spoon the zingy marinade evenly over the basa


### Step 5

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the fish to form a sealed parcel[s]

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through – this is your zingy basa en papillote

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 7

Once the rice is nearly tender, add the chopped garlic and your sugar snap peas to the same pot

Cook for a further 5 min before draining everything

Once drained, season lightly with salt and pepper and stir through the carrot ribbons until they've softened slightly – this is your vegetable rice

### Step 8

Serve the zingy basa en papillote with the vegetable rice to the side

Pour over any remaining zingy marinade and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
