### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, then skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and boil half a kettle

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 7-8 min or until mostly cooked through

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber into batons

### Step 4

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Add your couscous to a heat-proof bowl with the chicken stock, cover and set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed

### Step 5

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 6

Once the chicken is almost cooked through, add your ground coriander to the pan with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your coriander chicken

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your natural yoghurt, most of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), the juice of half your lemon[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl

Give everything a stir – this is your mint yoghurt

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the coriander chicken over the couscous and top with the cucumber batons

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt

Garnish with your flaked almonds, the remaining chopped mint, a lemon wedge and a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
