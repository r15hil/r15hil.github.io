## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, lets get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min

Drain the soaked noodles


### Step 4

Reboil half a kettle

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, then rip the green leaves from your pak choi and set them aside

Chop the white base into rough, large pieces

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds


### Step 5

Once the beef mince has browned slightly, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped pak choi white base and cook for 2-3 min or until softened


### Step 6

Combine your rice vinegar, soy sauce, red chilli relish and cornflour in a small bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stir-fry sauce


### Step 7

Add the stir-fry sauce, pak choi leaves and drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1 min until the sauce has started to coat the noodles and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Asian-style beef & pak choi noodles

### Step 8

Serve the Asian-style beef & pak choi noodles

Tear over your coriander and garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
