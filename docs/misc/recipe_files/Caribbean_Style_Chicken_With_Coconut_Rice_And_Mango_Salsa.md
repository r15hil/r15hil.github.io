## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and chicken stock mix in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 2

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your coconut rice


### Step 4

Combine your chicken thighs in a bowl with your ground allspice, soy sauce, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 9 min on each side or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Caribbean-style spiced chicken


### Step 6

Whilst the chicken is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely on the diagonal

Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Chop the mango flesh roughly, discarding the stone[s]


### Step 7

Combine the chopped mango and sliced spring onion in a bowl with the lime zest, the juice of half you lime[s], the chopped coriander, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your mango salsa

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Caribbean-style spiced chicken over the coconut rice with the mango salsa to the side

Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
