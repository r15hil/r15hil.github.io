## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, lets get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite


### Step 3

While the noodles are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, drain, then add your king prawns with your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 4-5 min until cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your mangetout in half roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed)

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Once the noodles are almost cooked, add the halved mangetout and cook for 1 min or until just cooked with a bite

Once cooked, drain the noodles & mangetout and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 5

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly


### Step 6

Once the prawns have cooked through add your soy sauce, red chilli relish and the juice of your lime[s] and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 30 secs further, or until thickened


### Step 7

Add the grated carrot and drained noodles & mangetout to the pan with the prawns and give everything a good mix up – these are your sweet chilli king prawn noodles

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry!

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

### Step 8

Serve your sweet chilli king prawn noodles and garnish with the chopped spring onion, crushed peanuts and a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!
