### Step 1

Cut your hake fillet[s] into 4 pieces per person

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add your hake pieces with the grated garlic, curry powder and soy sauce to a large bowl

Give it a good mix up and set aside to marinate

### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml]</span> cold water and your ground turmeric and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your turmeric rice

### Step 3

Cut your cucumber in half, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard, then chop in to bite-sized pieces

Combine your shredded red cabbage and chopped cucumber in a large bowl

Add your white wine vinegar, nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage

### Step 4

Add your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a small bowl, then swirl through your mango chutney – this is your mango yoghurt

### Step 5

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 6

Add your cornflour to the marinated hake pieces, and give everything a good mix up so the hake pieces are fully coated in cornflour

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned – this is your curried crispy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Add the chopped mint and coriander to the turmeric rice and stir it all together – this is your herby turmeric rice

Serve your curried crispy hake on top of the herby turmeric rice and the quick-pickled red cabbage to the side

Dollop the mango yoghurt over everything

Enjoy!
