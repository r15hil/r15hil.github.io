- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- White long grain rice (130g)
- White long grain rice (65g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to a bowl with your fish sauce and a generous grind of black pepper

Set aside to marinate


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add 3 tsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and caramelised


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 5

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water with your soy sauce – this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Once the sugar has caramelised, add the marinated basa and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

Once browned, add the pepper strips, chopped garlic, chopped ginger, sliced shallot and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cook for 3-4 min or until your fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened – this is your Vietnamese-style caramelised & braised basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Add the grated carrot, chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) and your white wine vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your carrot salad

### Step 8

Serve your Vietnamese-style caramelised & braised basa with the cooked rice and carrot salad to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped coriander

Enjoy!
