Pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Once the soup base has thickened, add the chopped smoked basa, cooked potatoes and your double cream and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add a very generous grind of pepper and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once the fish is cooked through, add half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your smoked basa & leek cullen skink

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa & leek cullen skink in a bowl and sprinkle over your smoked sea salt and the remaining chopped parsley

Serve the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!
