## Ingredients

- 2 tomatoes
- 200g linguine 
- 2 tbsp rich tomato paste
- 4 British chicken thigh fillets
- 2 tbsp Italian balsamic vinegar
- 30g sun-dried tomatoes
- 20g fresh basil 
- 30g pitted black olives
- 50g rocket salad 
- 40g Italian hard cheese
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chicken thigh fillets and cook for 3-4 min, turning once half way, until they're golden on both sides


Add the sun-dried tomatoes to a bowl, cover them with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and leave them to soak


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice&nbsp;the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Cut the tomatoes&nbsp;into wedges


### Step 3

Once the chicken thighs are golden, transfer them to a plate, leaving any juices behind&nbsp;


Add the chopped onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min over a medium-low heat&nbsp;


Add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further


### Step 4

Add the tomato paste, tomato wedges, sun-dried tomatoes (including the soaking liquid), half of the balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar to the pan and cook for 1-2 min


Return the chicken thighs to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through


Re-boil a kettle&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup&nbsp;of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Shave the Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of 'cheese shavings' and grate any remaining cheese


Chop the basil finely, including the stalks


Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl - this is your balsamic dressing&nbsp;


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, shred it&nbsp;apart in the pan, using two forks - this technique is known as &lsquo;pulling'


Add the black olives and chopped basil


Season with a pinch of&nbsp;salt and pepper and add the drained linguine&nbsp;


Tip: if the sauce looks a bit dry add some of the starchy pasta water&nbsp;

### Step 8

Wash and dry&nbsp;the rocket&nbsp;then tumble it&nbsp;with the&nbsp;cheese shavings and the balsamic dressing


Serve the fresh tomato &amp; chicken ragu&nbsp;and garnish with the remaining&nbsp;grated cheese


Enjoy!
