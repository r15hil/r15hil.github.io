## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise 
- 1 tomato
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 hake fillets
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 0 curry powder
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 0 ground turmeric
- 6 plain tortillas
- 80g spinach
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Cut your hake fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to a bowl with your curry powder, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up so that the hake is fully coated in the spices


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Pick your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discarding the stalks


### Step 4

Add the chopped coriander and mint to a pestle & mortar with a small squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt

Grind to a fine paste, then add your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your mint chutney

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything very finely!


### Step 5

Dice your tomato[es]

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with your nigella seeds, remaining sliced onion and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high

Add the coated hake to the pan and cook for 2-3 min without stirring, then turn the fish and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon[s] and mix to combine – this is your spiced hake

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat and once hot, remove the pan from the heat, then add the spinach

Return the pan to the heat, stir for 1 min or until the spinach is beginning to wilt very slightly, then remove from the heat

### Step 8

Serve the warmed tortillas topped with the wilted spinach, spiced hake and tomato salad

Drizzle with the mint chutney

Enjoy!
