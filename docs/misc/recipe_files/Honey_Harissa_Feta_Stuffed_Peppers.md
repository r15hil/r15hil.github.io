## Description

Harissa is a warm North African chilli paste. Here weâ€™ve used it two ways. Firstly by combining it with honey, it becomes a sweet glaze for the roasted vegetables. Secondly, by mixing it with a little balsamic vinegar, you create a sharp chilli dressing to cut through the warm bulgur wheat and baked feta.
