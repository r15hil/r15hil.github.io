NOTICE: All of these recipes have been retrieved from the Gousto API. I do not claim ownership of any recipes in these files. These recipes are provided for informational purposes only, based on publicly available data from Gousto.

## Description

This dish is inspired by one of Hong Kong's many signature dishes, the moreish, umami-packed clay pot rice. The rice absorbs all the juices from the chicken and mushrooms, and you'll amp up the flavours even more with a sweet-savoury sauce.

## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 0 white basmati rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 15ml soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 130g basmati rice
- 160g blanched peas
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 15ml mirin
- 2 garlic cloves
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until browned


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your onion[s]

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium, add the diced onion and sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until the onions are slightly caramelised

Once caramelised, add the chopped ginger and chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your basmati rice and Chinese rice wine to the pan with your chicken stock mix and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Give it a good mix up until the rice is fully coated


### Step 5

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your hoisin sauce, mirin and soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your hoisin dressing


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add your peas to the top of the rice, without stirring

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a final 2 min or until the rice is slightly crispy on the base of the pan

Once slightly crispy, gently stir the peas through the rice and season with salt and pepper – this is your Hong Kong-style chicken & mushroom rice

### Step 8

Serve the Hong Kong-style chicken & mushroom rice in bowls

Drizzle over the hoisin dressing and garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
