## Ingredients

- 0 chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 0 tomato paste
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tbsp berbere seasoning
- 0 British skinless chicken thighs
- 2 plain naans
- 2 white potatoes
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 320g British skinless chicken thighs
- 1 British free-range egg
- 5g parsley
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then transfer to a plate, reserving the pan


### Step 2

Take a knob of butter out of the fridge and set it aside to soften

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped potato and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has softened

Add a pinch of your berbere seasoning and the softened butter to a bowl and mix it all together, then set aside – this is your berbere-spiced butter


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the remaining berbere seasoning and tomato paste to the pan with your ginger & garlic paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a small pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[575ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [750ml]</span> boiled water

Once fragrant, return the browned chicken to the pan, add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reboil a kettle

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the potato is fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)– this is your Ethiopian-style doro wat


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a small pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the soft-boiled egg[s] to the bowl

Set aside, then once cooled, peel the cooled soft-boiled egg[s] and cut them in half


### Step 7

When the potato is nearly fork-tender, add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once done, remove the warmed naan[s] from the toaster and spread with the berbere-spiced butter – this is your berbere-spiced butter naan[s]

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the Ethiopian-style chicken doro wat in bowls and top with a soft-boiled egg half

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Serve the berbere-spiced butter naan[s] to the side

Enjoy!
