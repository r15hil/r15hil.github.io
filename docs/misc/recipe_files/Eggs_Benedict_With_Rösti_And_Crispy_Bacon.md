## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 135g Jolly Good smoked streaky bacon
- 2 white potatoes
- 120g asparagus spears
- 10.5g wholegrain mustard
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Grate the potatoes (skins on)

Trim and finely slice the spring onions


### Step 2

Add the grated potato to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, then twist the ball and squeeze out as much liquid as you can


### Step 3

Add the potato mixture to a bowl with the sliced spring onion, smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Separate the mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and shape into firm potato cakes, approx 1cm thick


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the potato cakes and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden and crispy

Once done, add them to a plate and set aside (reserve the pan) – these are your potato röstis

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!


### Step 5

While the röstis are cooking, add the smoked streaky bacon to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add the asparagus spears to the other side of the tray with a small drizzle of olive oil

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use two trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 10-15 min until the bacon is crispy and the asparagus has softened


### Step 6

Bring a pot of boiled water to a very gentle boil over a medium heat (make sure the water is only slightly bubbling, otherwise it may break the yolks!)

Once gently boiling, add half of the white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!)

Crack the eggs into the water and cook for 3-4 min

Once done, gently transfer the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper and season them with black pepper


### Step 7

Return the rösti pan to a low heat and add the clotted cream

Once the clotted cream has melted, remove the pan from the heat and add the mayo, remaining white wine vinegar and half <span class="text-danger">[all] </span>the wholegrain mustard

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save remaining wholegrain mustard for another recipe!

Whisk until you have a thick sauce then season with salt and pepper – this is your speedy hollandaise

### Step 8

Serve the potato röstis stacked up on the plate with the crispy bacon and a poached egg on top

Spoon over the speedy hollandaise and serve the roasted asparagus to the side

Enjoy!
