Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalk[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until slightly softened

Add the chopped potatoes to a separate tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min

### Step 3

While the aubergine and potatoes are in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your tomato paste with half the chopped garlic and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add your dried basil with a generous pinch of salt, a pinch of sugar, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> [6 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato base

### Step 4

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>rectangle per person

Score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry rectangle[s] with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)

### Step 5

After the initial 10 min, remove the tray with the aubergine from the oven and transfer the cooked aubergine to a clean chopping board (careful it will be hot!) and reserve the tray

Line the reserved baking tray with baking paper and add the pastry rectangle[s]

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1679568190707-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Top the pastry rectangle[s] with the tomato base, spreading it out evenly, keeping it within the borders

Divide the softened aubergine equally between the pastry

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your aubergine tart[s]

### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Add the salad to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad

Combine your mayo with the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a small splash of water – this is your garlic mayo

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine tart with the roast potatoes, dressed salad and a dollop of garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
