## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 1 Henderson's Relish sachet (15ml)
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 can of cannellini beans (400g)
- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 5g parsley
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop the chicken breast into roughly bite-sized pieces

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Combine the mayonnaise sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl

Add a handful of flour to a plate and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the panko breadcrumbs and the chopped parsley to a bowl (or plate) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give it a good mix up


### Step 3

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into chips


### Step 4

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until cooked through, golden and crisp


### Step 5

Coat the chicken pieces in the flour, tap off any excess, then coat them in the mayonnaise and finally press them firmly into the breadcrumbs until evenly coated - these are your herby chicken nuggets

Lightly grease a baking tray with vegetable oil

Add the herby chicken nuggets to the baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden


### Step 6

While the chicken nuggets are cooking, finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until softened


### Step 7

Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Once the onions have softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the vegetable stock, Henderson's Relish, tomato frito and cannellini beans with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 5-8 min or until reduced to a baked bean-like consistency

### Step 8

Season the beans with a pinch of salt and pepper

Serve the herby chicken nuggets with the chips and beans to the side

Enjoy!
