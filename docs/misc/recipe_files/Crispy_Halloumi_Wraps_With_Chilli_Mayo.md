## Ingredients

- Ground paprika (1tsp)
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Halloumi (200g)
- Mayonnaise (25ml) x0
- Panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Tomato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add a handful of flour to a plate along with the ground paprika and a generous grind of pepper and mix it all together – this is your spice mix


### Step 2

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Grate the cheddar cheese

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the grated cheese, a generous grind of pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs


### Step 3

Slice your halloumi into strips (3 per person!)

Coat the halloumi strips in the spice mix (make sure to tap off any excess!)

Add the coated halloumi strips to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded halloumi strips


### Step 4

Line a baking tray with tin foil

Add the breaded halloumi strips to the tray and top them with any remaining cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden – these are your crispy halloumi strips


### Step 5

While the halloumi strips are cooking, slice your tomato[es] finely into rounds

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely


### Step 6

Add your chilli relish to a bowl with your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your chilli mayo


### Step 7

Once the halloumi strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

### Step 8

Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy halloumi strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!
