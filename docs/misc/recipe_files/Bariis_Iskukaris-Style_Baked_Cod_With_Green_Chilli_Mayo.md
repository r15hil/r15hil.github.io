### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, Let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the dish

### Step 3

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon), then gently bash with a rolling pin until the skin has broken down

### Step 4

Add the tomato wedges and crushed cardamom pods to the dish with most of your garam masala (save the rest for later!), ground turmeric, roasted garlic paste, white long grain rice and your sultanas

Add your vegetable stock mix, half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up, then bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the crushed chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar, mayo and a small pinch of salt and sugar

Mix it all together and set aside – this is your green chilli mayo

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1691058841849-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1691058845973-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After 18 min, remove the dish from the oven and add your cod fillet[s] with a generous knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle over the remaining garam masala

Return the dish to the oven for a further 12 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your bariis iskukaris-style baked cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the bariis iskukaris-style baked cod and drizzle over the green chilli mayo

Garnish with your crispy onions

Dig in!
