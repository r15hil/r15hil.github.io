## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Ground cumin (1tsp) x0
- Mayonnaise (25ml)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground cumin (2tsp)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Carrot

- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min


### Step 3

Add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, then add your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar and mix to combine – this is your spicy stock


### Step 4

Add the spicy stock to the beef mince

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your beef chilli


### Step 5

While the chilli is cooking, combine your mayo with the zest and juice of half of your lime, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your zesty slaw dressing

Finely grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Once the chips are done, push them into 1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with your beef chilli and then the grated cheddar cheese and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Once done, set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly – these are your loaded beef chilli cheese fries


### Step 7

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrots[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Combine the grated carrot, shredded lettuce and the zesty slaw dressing in a bowl then give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty slaw

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the loaded beef chilli cheese fries with the zesty slaw to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
