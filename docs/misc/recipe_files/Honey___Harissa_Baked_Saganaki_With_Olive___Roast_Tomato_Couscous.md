## Ingredients

- 60g black olives
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 100g Greek salad cheese
- 120g couscous
- 40g harissa paste
- 25g honey
- 5g parsley
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 1 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add the onion petals and halved tomatoes to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Sprinkle over 3/4 of the ras el hanout (save the rest for later!) with a grind of pepper

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in the oven for 15 min or until slightly charred – this is your roast veg


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the black olives in half

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in quarters

Combine the natural yoghurt and half the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with half the honey and the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon – this is your yoghurt & harissa dressing


### Step 5

Combine the couscous with the remaining ras el hanout and a drizzle of olive oil in a large heatproof bowl

Add 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed


### Step 6

Top the Greek cheese with the remaining honey and the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Once the roast veg is slightly charred, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven

Add the Greek cheese to the other side of the baking tray and return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven

Cook for 4-5 min or until the cheese is warmed through – this is your honey & harissa baked saganaki


### Step 7

Once the couscous is ready, fluff with a fork, then add the roast veg and chopped olives

Add the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon and half the parsley (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your olive & roast tomato couscous

### Step 8

Serve the honey & harissa baked saganaki over the olive & roast tomato couscous

Drizzle over the yoghurt & harissa dressing

Garnish with the remaining lemon and remaining parsley

Enjoy!
