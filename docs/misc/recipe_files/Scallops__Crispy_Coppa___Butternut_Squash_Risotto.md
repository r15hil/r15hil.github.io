## Description

This posh risotto blends the flavours from sea and land to create a real showstopper of a dish. On top: sweet and tender pan-fried king scallops, shards of salty coppa and crisped fresh sage leaves. The risotto has real depth of flavour, thanks to a simple butternut squash purée and lots of grated Italian hard cheese.

## Ingredients

- 204g raw, roe off king scallops
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 160g arborio rice
- 48g British sliced coppa
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 120g butternut squash cubes
- 1 garlic clove
- 10g sage
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Soften the onion


Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 350°F/ Gas 4.


Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>. Peel and finely chop the garlic.


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat.


Once hot, add the diced onion and garlic and cook for 8-10 minutes or until softened.


### Step 2

Mash the butternut squash


Meanwhile, boil a kettle.


Add the butternut squash cubes<span class="text-highlight"> to a pot of boiled water (</span>just enough to cover them) with a pinch of <span class="text-highlight">salt</span>, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 minutes or until they're tender.


Once done, drain and mash until smooth.


### Step 3

Cook the risotto


Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml<span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> of boiled water.


Once the onion has softened, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat the grains in the oil.


Add <span class="text-highlight">1/3 </span>of the stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed.


Continue to add the stock a little at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 minutes or until the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked.


### Step 4

Cook the coppa 


Add the sliced coppa to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-8 minutes or until crispy.


### Step 5

Make the crispy sage


Once the risotto is almost done, heat a separate large, wide-based frying pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat.


Once hot, add the sage leaves and cook for 1 minute or until crispy.


Set aside on a piece of kitchen paper to drain the excess oil and season with a pinch of salt.


Reserve the pan for later.


### Step 6

Fry the king scallops


Pat the king scallops dry with kitchen towel.


Return the pan to a medium-high heat. Once very hot, add the scallops and cook for 1-2 minutes on one side, or until golden brown. 


Flip the scallops and cook for 1 minute further or until cooked through. 


Tip: your scallops are cooked when they turn opaque.


### Step 7

Finish off the risotto


Stir the butternut squash purée, grated Italian hard cheese and a knob of butter through the cooked risotto and cook for 1-2 minutes further or until the cheese has melted – this is your butternut squash risotto.

### Step 8

Serve up!


Break the coppa into shards.


Serve the scallops, coppa shards and crispy sage leaves over the butternut squash risotto.


Enjoy!
