### Step 1

Top, tail, and grate your carrot[s]

Combine your gram flour and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour in a large bowl with your curry powder, half your nigella seeds (you'll use the rest later!) and 6 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[9 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[12 tbsp]</span> cold water

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up until there are no lumps – this is your pakora batter

### Step 2

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and chop any larger pieces into small bite-sized pieces

Add the grated carrot and haddock bites to the pakora batter and mix everything together until fully coated – this is your pakora mix

Set aside the pakora mix until later

### Step 3

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife, then add them to a pot with a lid with your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, divide the pakora mix into 2 pieces per person and add to the pan, then press them down with the back of a spoon to flatten and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crisp – these are your haddock pakoras

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then chop into chunks

Chop your tomato[es] finely

### Step 6

Combine your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl with the remaining nigella seeds, a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chopped tomato and cucumber chunks and toss – this is your pickled salad

### Step 7

Combine your natural yoghurt and mango chutney in a small bowl with the sriracha – this is your chilli-mango dip

Once the haddock pakoras are golden and crisp, season them with a generous pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the haddock pakoras over the cardamom rice with the pickled salad to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Serve the chilli-mango dip to the side

Enjoy!
