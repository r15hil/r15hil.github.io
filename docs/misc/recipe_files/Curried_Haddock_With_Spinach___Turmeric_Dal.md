## Ingredients

- 120g spinach
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 green lentils
- 390g green lentils
- 1 haddock bites
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 0 curry powder
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 spinach
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1/2 cucumber
- 200g haddock bites
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon
- 100g red lentils

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the rinsed red lentils to a pot with plenty of cold water, then bring to the boil over a high heat and reduce to medium-low and cook for 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot


### Step 2

Whilst the lentils are cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away and chop the cucumber finely

Cut your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Finely chop your coriander, including the stalks


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Combine your natural yoghurt with the chopped coriander, the juice of half your lemon and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander yoghurt

Combine the chopped cucumber with the chopped mint, nigella seeds, juice of the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt – this is your cucumber salad


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, garlic and ground turmeric and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and add them to a tin foil-lined tray (or two!)

Sprinkle over your curry powder and turn the haddock bites several times until they're fully coated

Lightly drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 7-8 min or until cooked through – this is your curried haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the red lentils are cooked, add them to the pan with the green lentils and the spinach and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the lentils are warmed through – this is your spinach & turmeric dal

### Step 8

Serve the curried haddock over the spinach & turmeric dal with the cucumber salad to the side

Dollop over the coriander yoghurt

Enjoy!
