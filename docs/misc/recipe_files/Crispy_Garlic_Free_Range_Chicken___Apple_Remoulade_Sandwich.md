## Ingredients

- 40g panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- Gem lettuce
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Ciabatta x2
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Sweet potato
- Apple
- Parsley (5g) x0
- Parsley (10g)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dice your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skin on) finely

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film, then bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened

Pat dry with kitchen paper – this is your chicken escalope


### Step 4

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a shallow bowl with the chopped garlic and season with a pinch of salt – this is your garlic panko

Turn the chicken escalope[s] in the garlic panko until fully coated – this is your garlic panko chicken

Tip: Press the chicken into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the garlic panko chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy garlic free range chicken

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if the pan looks a little dry


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and pop the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Separate 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>outer leaves per person from the lettuce, wash the leaves and pat dry with kitchen paper, then set them aside for serving

Cut the inner core[s] into quarters

Combine the diced apple, chopped shallot, mayo, cider vinegar and chopped parsley in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper – this is your apple remoulade

### Step 8

Slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half

Fill the warmed ciabatta halves with the lettuce leaves, apple remoulade and crispy garlic free range chicken

Serve the sweet potato chips and lettuce quarters to the side

Dollop any remaining apple remoulade over the lettuce quarters

Enjoy!
