## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a pot with a lid over a medium heat

Once hot, add your basmati rice with a pinch of ground turmeric (save the rest for later!)

Cook for 30 secs or until the grains are coated in the spices


### Step 2

Add 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml]</span> cold water and your sultanas and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sultana rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, cut your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, turn the heat up to high and add the chopped chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over

Add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, chopped tomato, remaining ground turmeric, tomato paste and garam masala to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Stir in your vegetable stock mix, then add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 7-8 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your clotted cream – this is your mild chicken curry

### Step 8

Serve the mild chicken curry over the sultana rice and enjoy!
