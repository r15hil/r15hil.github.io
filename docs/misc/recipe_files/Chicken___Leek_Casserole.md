## Ingredients

- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- British diced chicken thigh (250g)
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- White potato x4
- Carrot
- Leek
- Shallot
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden


### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, peel and chop your shallot[s] into wedges

Wash your leek[s] thoroughly to remove any grit, then top, tail and slice into rounds


### Step 3

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock


### Step 4

Once the chicken is golden, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the shallot wedges and leek rounds to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your garlic

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>on the diagonal

Peel and chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once the shallot & leek have softened, add the chopped garlic, dried thyme and a large knob of butter to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs


### Step 7

Add the chopped potatoes, chopped carrot, chicken stock and a generous pinch of salt to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender – this is your chicken & leek casserole

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & leek casserole in a bowl

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
