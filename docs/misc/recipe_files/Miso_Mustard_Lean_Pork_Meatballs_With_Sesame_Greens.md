## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 0 British lean pork mince (<5% fat)
- 0 fine green beans
- 17g white miso paste
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 250g British lean pork mince (<5% fat)
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 130g brown rice
- 15ml soy sauce
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 0 brown basmati rice
- 80g spinach
- 1 shallot
- 0 soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add the chopped shallot, lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!), panko breadcrumbs and half the chopped ginger to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your lean pork mixture


### Step 3

Divide your lean pork mixture and shape into 3 meatballs per person

Add the lean pork meatballs to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put they tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the meatballs are cooking, boil half a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat


### Step 5

Once hot, add your toasted sesame oil with the chopped green beans, remaining chopped ginger and half of your soy sauce and cook for 4-5 min or until the beans are beginning to soften

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if it's looking a little dry!

Once beginning to soften, add the spinach and cook for 1-2 min further or until wilted – these are your sesame greens


### Step 6

While the greens are cooking, combine your miso paste with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>boiled water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar in a small bowl

Once combined, stir in your rice vinegar, Dijon mustard and remaining soy sauce – this is your miso-mustard sauce


### Step 7

Once the greens are cooked, remove them from the pan and set aside until serving, reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat (no need to clean!)

Once hot, add the miso-mustard sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through and slightly thickened

### Step 8

Serve the lean pork meatballs with the brown rice and sesame greens to the side

Drizzle the miso-mustard sauce over the meatballs

Enjoy!
