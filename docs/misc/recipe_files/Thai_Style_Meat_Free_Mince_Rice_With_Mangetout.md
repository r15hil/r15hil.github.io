## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix

Cook for 3-4 min or until the mince is browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Add your mangetout to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Add your red Thai curry paste, ginger paste and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] into wedges


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste, a pinch of sugar and 100ml<span class="text-purple"> <span class="text-danger">[125ml]</span> [150ml]</span> cold water to the pan and mix until everything is combined

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains, then add to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Stir through half of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) and the juice of half the lime[s] 

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice and meat-free mince are piping hot – this is your Thai-style meat-free mince rice with mangetout

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style meat-free mince rice with mangetout and garnish with the reserved chopped basil, a lime wedge and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
