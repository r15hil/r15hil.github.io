### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice, a pinch of salt and 225ml [300ml] <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped peppers with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened slightly

Return the pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

### Step 6

Once the mince has browned, add your cornflour, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and agave, then return the softened peppers to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until sticky and the meat-free mince is cooked through

### Step 8

Serve the sticky sesame meat-free stir-fry over the cooked rice
