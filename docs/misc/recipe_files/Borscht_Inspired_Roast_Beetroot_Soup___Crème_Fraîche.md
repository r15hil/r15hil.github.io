## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste
- 80g crème fraîche
- 1 parsnip
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 15g pine nuts
- 2 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 25g honey
- 5g dill
- 3 garlic cloves
- 250g cooked beetroot
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Top, tail and slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin discs

Top, tail and slice the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin discs

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins


### Step 2

Drain the beetroot in a colander over a bowl, reserve the liquid

Chop the beetroot into quarters

Add the sliced carrot and parsnip to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with the onion wedges, crushed garlic and beetroot quarters

Drizzle over a little vegetable oil and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 15 min or until everything is tender


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes and beetroot liquid to a pot with a matching lid with 750ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water and a very generous pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon with the crème fraîche in a small bowl – this is your lemon crème fraîche

Chop the dill finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Once the veg is tender, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven

Add the pine nuts to one side of the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drizzle the honey over the beetroot and onion

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 3-4 min or until the pine nuts are lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 6

Once the pine nuts are golden, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and transfer the honey roasted beetroot & onion to the pot with the potatoes

Add the roasted garlic, parsnip, carrot and the juice of the remaining lemon

Add the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your soup


### Step 7

Once boiling, remove the pot from the heat and use a (stick) blender (or transfer to a large food processor) to blitz until smooth, then return to a low heat to keep warm

Season with salt and pepper to your liking – this is your borscht-inspired roast beetroot soup

Slice the ciabattas in half, add them to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty

### Step 8

Serve the borscht-inspired roast beetroot soup in bowls

Drizzle over the lemon crème fraîche and sprinkle over the chopped dill and toasted pine nuts

Serve the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!
