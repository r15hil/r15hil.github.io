## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine and set aside until later

While the linguine is cooking, reboil half a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add the halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min further


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop your chives finely


### Step 5

Add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Pour in the tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has begun to thicken

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until cooked through

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and remove from the heat


### Step 6

Stir through your clotted cream and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for later!)


### Step 7

Add the drained linguine to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy king prawn linguine with tomatoes & chilli

Tip: If the sauce is too thin, return it to the heat and stir until the sauce sticks to the pasta

### Step 8

Serve the creamy king prawn linguine with tomatoes & chilli and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
