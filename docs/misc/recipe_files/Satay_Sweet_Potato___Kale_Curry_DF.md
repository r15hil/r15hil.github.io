## Description

“This hearty, nutty curry's from my Veggie Lean in 15 book and is super satisfying! You'll add roasted sweet potatoes for slow release energy and thicken it with lentils for a Gousto twist. Finish it off with a squeeze of lime, a dollop of coconut yoghurt and some crunchy roasted peanuts. Winner!”

## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 25g roasted peanuts
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 80g coconut yoghurt
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 52g smooth peanut butter
- 1 sweet potato
- 80g shredded kale
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 lime
- 100g red lentils
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>(skin on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is cooked and golden


### Step 3

While the sweet potato is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Rinse the red lentils, add them to the pan with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the lentils are cooked and tender


### Step 6

Meanwhile, separate the coriander leaves from the stalks, then chop the coriander stalks roughly (save the leaves for garnish!)

Chop the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Wash the shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the lentils are cooked, add the shredded kale to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 3-5 min or until the kale has wilted


### Step 7

Once the kale has wilted, add the peanut butter with the chopped coriander stalks and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and stir it all together – this is your satay kale curry

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the roasted sweet potato over the satay kale curry

Finish with a dollop of coconut yoghurt

Garnish with the coriander leaves, roasted peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
