## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 2

Dice your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into cubes

Add the sweet potato cubes and halved Tenderstem broccoli to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and half of your tamari soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!)

Give it a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sweet potato has softened

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop the ginger

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Trim, then chop your red chilli[es] roughly

Roughly chop your cashew nuts


### Step 4

Add the chopped ginger, garlic and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Tear in half of your coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and blitz – this is your laksa paste

Remove half of your laksa paste (save the rest for later!) and add it to a bowl with the chopped cashew nuts, rice vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and give it a good mix up – this is your spicy cashew sambal


### Step 5

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water, then set aside for 10 min or until softened with a slight bite

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside then peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based deep pan or pot (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 6

Reboil a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 800ml <span class="text-purple">[1.2L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.6L]</span> boiled water

Add the remaining tamari soy sauce – this is your coconut stock


### Step 7

Once the shallot has started to caramelise, add the laksa paste, sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and red Thai curry paste and cook for 1 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and rice noodles and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2-5 min or until the noodles are tender – this is your laksa

### Step 8

Serve the laksa in bowls and top with the roasted sweet potato and roasted Tenderstem broccoli

Tear over the remaining coriander leaves and dollop over the spicy cashew sambal

Enjoy!
