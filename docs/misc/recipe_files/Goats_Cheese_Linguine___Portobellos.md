## Ingredients

- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 200g linguine 
- 10g fresh tarragon 
- 2 shallots
- 1 garlic clove
- 125g French goats' cheese log 
- 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Cut the mushroom<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into thick slices


Peel and slice the shallots finely


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat


### Step 2

Once hot, add the mushroom and shallots with a big pinch of salt (to draw out the moisture)


Cook for 4 min until starting to caramelise, stirring occasionally


Tip: Overcrowding your pan prevents caramelisation, so do this in one layer across two pans if needed


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the linguine to a large pot of boiling water over a high heat with a big pinch of salt


Cook for 8 min or until tender with a slight bite


Tip: The pasta will finish cooking later on


Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Stir the garlic and balsamic into the pan of browned mushroom and shallots


Reduce the heat to medium and cook for a further 8 min or until the balsamic is sticky


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the tarragon finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Break the goats' cheese up into small pieces


Drain the cooked linguine, reserving 200ml <span class="text-danger">(300ml)</span> pasta water and return it to the pot off the heat


### Step 7

Crumble 2/3 of the goats' cheese into the pasta and stir vigorously


Add the pasta water, a little at a time, until a creamy sauce forms

### Step 8

Add most of the tarragon to the creamy linguine and season generously with salt and pepper


Serve in bowls and top with the balsamic mushrooms, remaining goats' cheese and tarragon


Enjoy!
