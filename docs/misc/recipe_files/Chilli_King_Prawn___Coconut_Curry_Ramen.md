## Ingredients

- 2 fine egg noodle nests
- 20g coconut flakes
- 1/2 tbsp curry powder
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 carrot
- 30ml soy sauce
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Slice the mushrooms finely

Top, tail and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 2

Heat a large pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushroom and diced carrot and cook for 7 min or until the mushrooms are tender and lightly golden


### Step 3

Once the mushrooms are tender, reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped creamed coconut with the curry powder and half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the soy sauce and 650ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 8 min or until the carrot is tender – this is your curry ramen broth


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden – these are your toasted coconut flakes

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don’t burn!
Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, drain then add the king prawns and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your chilli king prawns


### Step 7

Once the carrot is tender, bring the curry ramen broth to the boil over a medium-high heat and add the fine egg noodles

Cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are cooked with a slight bite – this is your coconut curry ramen

### Step 8

Serve the coconut curry ramen topped with the chilli king prawns and toasted coconut flakes

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
