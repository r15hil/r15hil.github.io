- 110g salmon fillet x0
- Quinoa (70g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a lid with 180ml <span class="text-purple">[270ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[360ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

Whilst the salmon is cooking, cut half your orange[s] in half


### Step 4

Combine the juice of the orange halves with your miso paste, rice vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your orange-miso dressing


### Step 5

Peel the remaining orange[s] and slice finely

Cut your sugar snap peas in half lengthways

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 6

Cut your avocado[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad, cooked quinoa (still steaming hot? Rinse it under cold water!), sliced spring onion, sugar snap peas and coriander to a large bowl

Add most of the orange-miso dressing (save the rest for later!) and give it a gentle mix up – this is your quinoa salad

### Step 8

Divide the quinoa salad between plates

Top with the cooked salmon, orange slices and the sliced avocado

Drizzle over the remaining orange-miso dressing and garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
