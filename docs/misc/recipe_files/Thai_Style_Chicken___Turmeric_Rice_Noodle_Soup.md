## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 2

Reboil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel lengths off your courgette[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons


### Step 3

Dissolve your creamed coconut and rice vinegar in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water with your chicken stock mix, soy sauce, fish sauce, lime leaves and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock

Chop your chicken breast strips into smaller strips


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast strips with a generous pinch of salt and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until starting to brown


### Step 5

Once brown, add the sliced shallot to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add your ground turmeric and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for an initial 4 min

After 4 min, add the courgette ribbons to the pan and cook for 1-2 min until the courgette is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai-style chicken & turmeric soup

### Step 8

Discard the lime leaf[ves]

Add the drained rice noodles to a bowl and top with the Thai-style chicken & turmeric soup

Enjoy!
