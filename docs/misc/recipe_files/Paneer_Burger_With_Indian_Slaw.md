## Description

Paneer (pan-ear) is an Indian cheese that is a great meat alternative in a lot of traditional Indian dishes. In that spirit, we've developed a spicy paneer burger, served with an Indian carrot and cucumber slaw, curry mayo and spiced potatoes. This is true fusion food, with the meatiness of the cheese replicating the meat in a conventional burger.

## Ingredients

- 50g mango chutney
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 cucumber 
- 1 tbsp home blend curry powder
- 2 ciabatta rolls 
- 250g traditional paneer
- 1 tsp black nigella seeds
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)
- 200g carrots 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 350&deg;F/ Gas 4


Boil kettle&nbsp;


Cut the waxy&nbsp;potatoes&nbsp;(skins on) into bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 2

Top, tail and peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of 'carrot&nbsp;ribbons'&nbsp;


Trim then peel the cucumber&nbsp;into ribbons, discarding the seedy core


Squeeze any excess liquid out of the 'cucumber ribbons'


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Combine the mango chutney with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl&nbsp;


Add 3/4 of the nigella seeds and season with a pinch of salt


Add the carrot and cucumber&nbsp;ribbons to the bowl and mix well - this is your Indian&nbsp;slaw


### Step 4

Drizzle the ciabatta rolls with a little olive oil and sprinkle over the remaining nigella seeds


Add them to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 5 min or until they are crispy and golden


Once crispy, remove from the oven and set aside to cool


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the paneer in half so you have two 'steaks'


Pat the paneer steaks&nbsp;dry with kitchen paper


Rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with the garam masala and a pinch of salt


### Step 6

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, over a medium heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the paneer steaks and cook for 2-3 min on each side until they are brown and crispy


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are cooked, drain over a sieve, reserving the pot


Return the potatoes back to the pan with a large knob of butter and 3/4 of the&nbsp;curry powder (reserve the rest for later)


Cook for 1 min until all the potatoes are coated in the curry butter


Season with a pinch of salt


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Mix the mayonnaise&nbsp;with the remaining curry powder&nbsp;and season with a small pinch of salt - this is your curry mayo


Once the ciabatta rolls have cooled, slice in half and fill with the paneer, Indian&nbsp;slaw&nbsp;and&nbsp;curry mayo


Serve the potatoes with the remaining Indian&nbsp;slaw


Enjoy!
