- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Black sesame seeds (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into thin strips

Chop your cucumber into discs

Slice each cucumber disc into matchsticks


### Step 3

Add the cucumber matchsticks to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt – this is your cucumber salad


### Step 4

Add your meat-free burger patties to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Cut your brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving


### Step 6

Once the brioche halves are toasted, wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium heat

Add your hoisin sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water and cook for 1 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the chips are cooked, sprinkle over your black sesame seeds – these are your black sesame chips

### Step 8

Top your toasted brioche base with a meat-free burger patty, a drizzle of warmed hoisin sauce, some cucumber salad, spring onion strips and the brioche lid

Serve any remaining cucumber salad and the black sesame chips to the side

Enjoy!
