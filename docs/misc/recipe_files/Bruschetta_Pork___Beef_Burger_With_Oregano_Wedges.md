## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Mayonnaise (25ml)
- Bread roll x2
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Pork & beef mince (250g)
- Pork & beef mince (125g) x0
- Basil (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with the dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Chop your cherry tomatoes finely

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes to a bowl with half the diced onion (save the rest for later!), chopped basil, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together – this is your bruschetta mixture

Combine your mayo with half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your balsamic mayo


### Step 4

Combine your pork & beef mince and remaining diced onion in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties, 1 per person


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork & beef patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your bread roll[s] in half

Remove the tray with the wedges from the oven and add the halved bread roll[s]

Return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until toasted and charred

Once toasted, remove the halved bread roll[s] from the oven and rub with the crushed garlic - this is your garlic bread roll


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

To build your burger, spread a dollop of balsamic mayo on the garlic ciabatta base and top with a handful of salad, a pork & beef patty, a spoonful of the bruschetta mixture and garlic ciabatta lid – this is your bruschetta burger

### Step 8

Serve the bruschetta burger with the oregano wedges and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the remaining balsamic vinegar and any remaining bruschetta mixture

Enjoy!
