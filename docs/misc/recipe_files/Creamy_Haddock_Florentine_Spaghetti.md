## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 100g crème fraîche
- 160g quick cook spaghetti
- 15g roasted garlic paste
- 80g spinach
- 200g haddock bites

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Wash the spinach

Once hot, add the roasted garlic paste, halved cherry tomatoes and spinach to the pan and cook for 2 min or until the spinach has wilted

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the spinach has wilted, add the vegetable stock to the pan with the crème fraîche and stir it all together

Cook for 1 min further or until the sauce is starting to thicken

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry


### Step 6

Add the haddock bites with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the fish is cooked, stir through the drained spaghetti and most of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your creamy haddock Florentine spaghetti

### Step 8

Set the creamy haddock Florentine spaghetti in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, season with a good grind of black pepper and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
