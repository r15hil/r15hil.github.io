Wash, then add the spinach to the pan with half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous grind of pepper

Serve the creamy pesto chicken over the warmed broccoli brown rice

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and tear over the basil leaves

Enjoy!
