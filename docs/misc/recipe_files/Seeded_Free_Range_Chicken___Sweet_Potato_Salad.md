## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your sweet potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onions into quarters, leaving the skins and root on

Tip: This stops them drying out and falling apart when roasting!

### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato and onion quarters to a baking tray (or two!) 

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the onion is tender and the sweet potato is cooked and starting to crisp

### Step 3

Cover your free range chicken breast portion[s] with cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until flattened to roughly 1.5cm thick all over

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the flattened chicken, season with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat

### Step 5

Transfer the browned chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Sprinkle the pine nut & seed mix all over

Put the tray in the oven for 14-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear – this is your seeded chicken

Tip: Watch the pine nut & seed mix a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and your chopped dates and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your date dressing

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to the bowl with the dressing

### Step 7

Once the vegetables are cooked, carefully cut the roots off the roasted onion quarters, then peel off the skins and discard

Separate the onion quarters into petals

Add the onion petals and roasted sweet potato to the salad bowl – this is your sweet potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the seeded free range chicken over the sweet potato salad

Drizzle the date dressing over the top and sprinkle over any remaining seeds from the tray

Enjoy!
