## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 1 cider vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1 Henderson's Relish sachet (15ml)
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 2 x 125g British chicken breast fillets
- 1 carrot
- 1 Dijon mustard pot (18g)
- 1 tomato ketchup sachet (30ml)
- 1 apple
- 1 honey pot (25g)
- 2 shallots

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Place on a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper, then put them in the oven for 30-40 min until golden


### Step 2

Combine the tomato ketchup, Henderson's Relish, Dijon mustard and honey with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large mixing bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your BBQ sauce


### Step 3

Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces

Add the chicken to the BBQ sauce and mix to coat thoroughly – this is your BBQ chicken

Refrigerate until step 5


### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then peel and finely chop (or grate) the shallots

Grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then tear or chop the little gem into bite-sized pieces

Add the above to a mixing bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your slaw salad


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the BBQ chicken to the pan, shaking off the excess BBQ sauce back into the bowl (you will use this later)

Cook for 3 min on each side or until charred

Tip: Alternatively cook on the BBQ until it's charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Transfer the charred chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Spoon the excess BBQ sauce over the chicken and put the tray in the oven for 5 min, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl with salt and pepper – this is your mayo dressing

Dress the slaw salad, mixing to coat everything evenly, with the mayo dressing just before serving

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ chicken with the wedges and slaw salad

Enjoy!
