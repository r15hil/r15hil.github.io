### Step 5

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until cooked through, golden and crisp – these are your homemade fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the sliced mangetout to a pot, covering them with boiled water until fully submerged and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2 min or until tender with a slight bite

Serve the homemade fish fingers with the chunky chips, minted mangetout and ketchup to the side
