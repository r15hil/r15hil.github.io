## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Meanwhile, drain your sweetcorn

Once hot, add your smoked basa to one side of the pan


### Step 3

Use a squeeze of lime juice over the basa and season generously with pepper

Sprinkle your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and dried oregano over the fish and add the drained sweetcorn to the other side of the pan

Cook the basa for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through (your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily)


### Step 4

While the basa is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred


### Step 5

Chop your tomatoes<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly and add to a bowl with the juice of half your lime

Season with salt and pepper, add a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salsa


### Step 6

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your mayo, a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water in a bowl – this is your chipotle mayo


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Once the basa is cooked, break it apart into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon – these are your spiced basa chunks

### Step 8

Set the warmed tortillas on the table, with the spiced basa chunks, warmed sweetcorn, zingy salsa and shredded lettuce, ready to share

Load up the wraps, add a drizzle of chipotle mayo, then squeeze over the remaining lime

Enjoy!
