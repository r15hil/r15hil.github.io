### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced chestnut mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until they're starting to brown

### Step 2

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, separating the white parts from the green parts

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your chicken breast strips into small bite-sized pieces

Cook for 2-3 min or until the chicken has started to brown

Once fragrant, add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml] </span>cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed, the rice is cooked and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Wash your spinach then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once everything is cooked, add the spinach and then cook, covered for a further 1-2 min or until wilted
