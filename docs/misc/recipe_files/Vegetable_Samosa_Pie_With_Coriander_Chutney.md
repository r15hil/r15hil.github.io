### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped potatoes, diced carrot and diced onion to the pan and cook for 6-8 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 4

Once the veg has softened, add half the chopped garlic and ginger (save the rest for later!) to the pan with your curry powder, tomato paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, pour in the stock and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add your blanched peas with a generous grind of pepper and transfer to an oven-proof dish – this is your vegetable samosa pie mix

### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour and unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Lay the puff pastry sheet over the pie dish and trim off any excess (use any excess pastry for fancy pie decorations!)

Press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through

### Step 6

Reboil a kettle

Grind the chopped herbs and remaining chopped garlic and ginger in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste

Add your rice vinegar, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil to the paste and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Serve the vegetable samosa pie with the green beans, a dollop of the coriander chutney and natural yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!
