## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 2 tomatoes
- 40g BBQ sauce
- 30g lighter cheese
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 6 plain tortillas
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 spring onion
- 1 pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tip: This is to warm your tortillas later – alternatively pop them in the microwave on a plate

Slice the chicken breast portions into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips, sliced onion and chicken strips to the pan with the smoked paprika and BBQ sauce

Cook for 8-10 min or until the vegetables have softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet 'n' smoky BBQ chicken fajita filling


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, chop the tomatoes roughly, then keep chopping them together until they resemble a salsa-like consistency


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomato to a bowl with the chilli flakes (cooking for kids? Skip the chilli!), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Stir it all together – this is your salsa


### Step 6

Add the tortillas to a baking tray

Put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 7

Grate the cheddar cheese

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

### Step 8

Serve the sweet 'n' smoky BBQ chicken fajita filling over the tortillas

Top with the grated cheese and salsa

Dollop over the natural yoghurt, garnish with the sliced spring onion and enjoy!
