### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Slice the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> lengthways into halves (green stalks on)

Place the halved aubergine onto a plate and put the plate in the microwave for 5 min

### Step 2

Whilst the aubergine is in the microwave, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then add the garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, remove the aubergine from the microwave and transfer to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 15-16 min or until cooked through and tender

Boil a full kettle

### Step 4

Once the onion and garlic has softened, add the ground cinnamon, ground coriander and ground cumin and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the lamb mince and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 5

Whilst the lamb mince is browning, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> with the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot

### Step 6

Once the lamb mince has browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 7-8 min or until the sauce has reduced to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your spiced lamb

While the sauce is reducing, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

### Step 7

Add most of the chopped mint (save a little for garnish) to the bulgur with a crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your minty bulgur

Remove the aubergine from the oven, then take a spoon and scoop one big spoonful from each half of the softened aubergine (careful, they will be hot!)

Add it to the spiced lamb and mix everything together

### Step 8

Place the aubergine halves in bowls and stuff them with the spiced lamb mixture

Serve the minty bulgur to the side and dollop over the natural yoghurt

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint and season with a generous crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
