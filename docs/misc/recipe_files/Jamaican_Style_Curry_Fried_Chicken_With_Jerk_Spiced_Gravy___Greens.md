### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your creamed coconut roughly

Add the chopped creamed coconut to a bowl with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up until fully dissolved and then set aside until cool

### Step 2

Meanwhile, wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water

### Step 3

Once the creamed coconut is cool, add your curry powder, ground cumin, dried thyme and ginger & garlic paste to the dissolved creamed coconut

Add your diced chicken thigh to the bowl with your corn flour and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate for 10 min

### Step 4

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Jamaican-style curry fried chicken

### Step 6

Add the sliced spring greens to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced garlic and a generous splash of cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the spring greens to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the spring greens are tender – this is your greens

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1714745790317-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add your jerk paste, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring frequently, until you're left with a sandy paste

Whisk in the stock, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your jerk-spiced gravy

### Step 8

Serve the Jamaican-style curry fried chicken with the chips, greens and jerk-spiced gravy to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
