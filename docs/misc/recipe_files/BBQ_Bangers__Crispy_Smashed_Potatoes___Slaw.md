## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 150g Shredded Red Cabbage
- 6 Proper Porker Cumberland Sausages 
- 80g hickory smoked BBQ sauce
- 15ml cider vinegar
- 2 carrots
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add the Cumberland sausages to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil (to prevent the sausages from sticking)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-12 min or until fork tender, then drain


### Step 3

Whilst the potatoes are boiling, combine the mayo, cider vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and a good grind of pepper in a large bowl – this is your creamy dressing


### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrots

Add the grated carrot and shredded cabbage to the bowl of creamy dressing

Give everything a good mix up — this is your slaw


### Step 5

Once drained, add the cooked potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Lightly squash each potato with a fork

Give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy smashed potatoes


### Step 6

Stir the hickory smoked BBQ sauce in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> of boiled water to loosen it

Once the sausages are cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and pour the BBQ sauce all over them

Return the tray to the oven for a further 5-6 min – these are your BBQ bangers


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ bangers with the crispy smashed potatoes and slaw to the side

Spoon any remaining BBQ sauce all over

Enjoy!
