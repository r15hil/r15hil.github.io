### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your baking trays and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain your tofu, then pat dry with kitchen paper and tear into large chunks

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

### Step 3

Combine your cornflour and soy sauce in a large bowl with half your peri peri spice mix (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of half of your lime[s]

Add the tofu chunks with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated tofu

Add your sweetcorn cobettes and a pinch of salt to a large piece of tin foil (or two!)

Scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed – this is your corn parcel[s]

### Step 4

Add the coated tofu (reserve the bowl!) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil to one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Add the corn parcel[s] to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Add the wedges to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the trays in the oven for 25-30 min or until the tofu and wedges are golden and crisp

### Step 5

Wipe clean the reserved bowl, then add the juice of the remaining lime, your ketchup and remaining peri peri spice mix (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your peri peri glaze

Slice your tomato[es] finely into rounds

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1694599364031-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once everything is nearly ready, add the brioche halves to the tray[s] with the wedges, then return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!

Once everything is ready, add the cooked tofu to the bowl with the peri peri glaze and give everything a good mix up – this is your oven baked spicy peri peri tofu

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread the warmed brioche base with your mayo, then top with the sliced tomato and oven baked spicy peri peri tofu and top with the warmed brioche bun lid – this is your oven baked spicy peri peri tofu burger

Serve the wedges and sweetcorn cobettes to the side
