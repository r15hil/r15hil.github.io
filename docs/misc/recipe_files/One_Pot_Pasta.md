## Description

The idea behind this dish is that you cook your linguine in a measured amount of stock, rather than a massive pan of water. Throw in your raw ingredients; garlic, cherry tomatoes, Italian hard cheese and herbs, to cook as one. They marry together to form perfectly cooked pasta and a silky smooth sauce.
