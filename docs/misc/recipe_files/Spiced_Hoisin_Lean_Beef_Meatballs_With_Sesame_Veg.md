### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger

Trim, then finely slice your spring onions

### Step 2

Add your lean beef mince to a large mixing bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, 1/3 of the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Add the grated garlic and half of the grated ginger (save the rest for later!) and mix it all up (clean hands are the best way!), then divide the meatball mixture into 3 meatballs per person

Add the lean beef meatballs to a lightly oiled baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

While the lean beef meatballs are in the oven, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, slice 1/4 of your red chilli[es] thinly so that you are left with chilli rounds (save these for garnish!)

Cut the remaining red chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

### Step 5

In a small bowl combine your hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a small splash of water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Add the remaining grated ginger and stir to combine – this is your spiced hoisin sauce

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1623079297123-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spinach and cook for 1 min or until beginning to wilt

Once wilted, remove the pan from the heat and add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, carrot ribbons and remaining sliced spring onion to the pan – this is your sesame veg

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1623079303569-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Transfer the sesame veg to a plate and cover to keep warm

Return the pan to a medium heat

Remove the cooked lean beef meatballs from the oven and add them to the pan with the spiced hoisin sauce

Cook for 2-3 min, coating the meatballs in the sauce until thickened and becoming sticky – these are your spiced hoisin lean beef meatballs

### Step 8

Serve the spiced hoisin lean beef meatballs with the sesame veg and cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Spoon over the spiced hoisin sauce from the pan and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
