## Ingredients

- 1 soft cheese pot (50g)
- 160g Chantenay carrots
- 4 white potatoes
- 2 x 125g British chicken breast fillets
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 soy sauce sachet (8ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil a kettle

Add the chicken breasts to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 2

Add the Chantenay carrots to the other side of the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the carrots are tender


### Step 3

Peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add them to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, chop the chestnut mushrooms roughly

Reboil a half a kettle


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve the soft cheese in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Once softened, add the soy sauce and creamy stock to the mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency – this is your creamy mushroom sauce


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a large splash of milk and a knob of butter

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken and serve it on top of the creamy mushroom sauce, with the mashed potato and Chantenay carrots to the side

Enjoy!
