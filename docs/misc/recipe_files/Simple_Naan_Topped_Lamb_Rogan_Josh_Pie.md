## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Boil a kettle

Once hot, add the sliced onion and your lamb mince with a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-7 min or until the onion is starting to soften and the mince has browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and mango chutney in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 4

Once the mince has browned, add your garam masala, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once fragrant, add the tomato wedges and stock and give everything a good mix up - this is your lamb rogan josh


### Step 5

Transfer the lamb rogan josh to an oven-proof dish

Put the dish in the oven and cook for an initial 10-15 min or until the stock is starting to thicken and the tomatoes have softened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, roughly tear your naan[s]

Pick your coriander leaves from their stalks


### Step 7

Once the tomatoes have softened, top the lamb rogan josh with the naan pieces

Drizzle with vegetable oil and sprinkle with your nigella seeds

Return the dish to the oven for a final 10-15 min or until the naan is crisp and golden - this is your naan-topped lamb rogan josh pie

### Step 8

Leave to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the naan-topped lamb rogan josh pie and garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!
