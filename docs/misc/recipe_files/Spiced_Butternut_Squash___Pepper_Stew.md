### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop

Once hot, add the onion wedges, chopped pepper and your butternut squash cubes to the oven-proof casserole dish and cook for 1 min
