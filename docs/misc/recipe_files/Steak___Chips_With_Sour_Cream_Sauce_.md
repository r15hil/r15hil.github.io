## Description

Our midweek steak and chips is the answer to home-made comfort food. The flash-fried steak cooks in mere minutes; with a simple pan-sauce made from the meat juices, plenty of black pepper and sour cream. Chips need not be an over-indulgence; their skins are a great source of nutrients so weâ€™ve left them on.

### Step 3

Place a large, wide-based pan over a medium-high heat for 2 min- you want it really hot for the steaks!


Boil a kettle

Pat the steaks dry, then rub them&nbsp;with 1-2 tsp vegetable oil and season with a large pinch of salt


Place the steaks in the pan and cook on each side for 1 min
