## Ingredients

- 1 bag of crispy onions (15g)
- 150g rice noodles
- 250g British beef strips
- 1 rice vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 carrot
- 1 soy sauce sachet (30ml)
- 10g coriander & mint mix
- 1/2 cucumber
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Add the beef strips to a bowl with half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous grind of black pepper

Set aside to marinate


### Step 2

Add the rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 3

Chop the cucumber into thin batons

Add the cucumber batons to a small bowl with the rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and set aside – this is your pickled cucumber


### Step 4

Peel and grate the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate the ginger

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 5

Combine the remaining soy sauce, juice from the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, grated ginger, half the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your fresh ginger & lime dressing

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-heat

Once hot, add the remaining garlic and half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until softened


### Step 7

Once softened, increase to the highest heat and add the marinated beef strips

Cook for 1-2 min until just seared

Once seared, transfer the chilli beef strips to a plate to rest

Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the rice noodles in bowls and add the chilli beef strips with the grated carrot, pickled cucumber, chopped herbs and crispy onions to the side

Drizzle the fresh ginger & lime dressing all over and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
