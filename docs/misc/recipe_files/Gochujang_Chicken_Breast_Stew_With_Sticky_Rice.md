Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into thin batons

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

### Step 4

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until starting to brown

### Step 5

Once starting to brown, add the carrot batons and chopped pepper to the pan with the grated ginger, chopped garlic and toasted sesame oil and cook for a further 3-4 min or until fragrant and starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, gochujang paste and soy sauce in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water – this is your spiced stock

### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, add the spiced stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar to the pan with a grind of pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the chicken is cooked, add the spinach to the pan and cook for a final 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your gochujang chicken breast stew

### Step 8

Serve the gochujang chicken breast stew and sticky rice in separate bowls

Garnish the stew with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
