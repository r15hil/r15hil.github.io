## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and roughly chop your potato[es]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined tray (or two!) and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then crimp the borders with a fork

Sprinkle your nigella seeds over the pastry and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your pie lid[s]


### Step 4

Once the onion has caramelised, increase the heat to high and add your chicken breast strips, chopped potato and curry powder and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and chicken stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the potato is fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Whilst the chicken is cooking, wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add your mustard seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and starting to pop

Add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite – these are your mustardy greens


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken curry pie filling

### Step 8

To serve, lay the pie lid over the chicken curry pie filling – this is your chicken curry pie

Serve the chicken curry pie with the mustardy greens to the side

Enjoy!
