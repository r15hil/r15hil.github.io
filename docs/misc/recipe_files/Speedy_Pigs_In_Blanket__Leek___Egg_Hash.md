## Ingredients

- Mustard ketchup (20g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Pigs in blankets (6pcs) x2
- British free range egg x2
- Chives (5g)
- Leek

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Cut your waxy potatoes (skins on) into very small chunks

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your leek[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a low heat

Once melted, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

While the leeks are softening, chop your pigs in blankets into thirds


### Step 4

Once the leek has softened, increase the heat to medium and add the pigs in blanket pieces to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min or until crispy and cooked through


### Step 5

Once cooked, add the drained potatoes to the pan and cook for 5-7 min or until brown and crispy

Tip: Stir as little as possible to give the potatoes a chance to brown


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Once the potatoes have browned, stir most of the chopped chives (save some for garnish!) into the pan, then serve up onto plates (keep the pan for the next step!) – this is your pigs in blanket & leek hash


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack them for perfectly centred yolks

### Step 8

Serve the fried eggs over the pigs in blanket & leek hash with your mustard ketchup to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped chives

Enjoy!
