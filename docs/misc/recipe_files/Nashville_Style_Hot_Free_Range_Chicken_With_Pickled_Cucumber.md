## Description

Our Nashville-style hot chicken is a little healthier, and gets a hefty hit of heat from our fiery hot sauce. Serve your crispy, spicy chicken with ciabatta, red cabbage slaw and tangy pickled cucumber. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

## Ingredients

- Ground paprika (1tsp)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Spring onion
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Shredded red cabbage (150g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Ciabatta
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- Cider vinegar (30ml)
- Ground almonds (25g)
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Dill (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Add your ground almonds, half your ground paprika and half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your Nashville-style chicken coating

Add 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml] </span>milk<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a bowl


### Step 2

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken


### Step 3

Dip the butterflied chicken in the milk, then coat with the Nashville-style chicken coating until both sides are well coated

Add the coated chicken to a baking tray (or two!) lined with non-stick baking paper with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Nashville-style hot free range chicken


### Step 4

While the chicken is in the oven, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Combine your shredded red cabbage, sliced spring onion (save a little for garnish), your wholegrain mustard, half your cider vinegar and most of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper – this is your slaw


### Step 5

Cut your cucumber into batons

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Add the cucumber batons, chopped dill and remaining cider vinegar to a bowl and season with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Once hot, add the sliced ciabatta, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving


### Step 7

Combine your sriracha, remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining ground paprika with the remaining natural yoghurt

Pour in half of the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber (discard the rest of the pickling liquid!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your hot sauce

### Step 8

Serve the Nashville-style hot free range chicken over the toasted ciabatta slice with quick-pickled cucumber and slaw to the side

Drizzle the hot sauce over the chicken

Sprinkle over the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
