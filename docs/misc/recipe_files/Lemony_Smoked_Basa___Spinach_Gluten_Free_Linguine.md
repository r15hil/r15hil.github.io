### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 2

While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min

Remove the pan from the heat and leave the garlic to infuse the oil

### Step 4

Return the pan with the garlic oil to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped basa and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to cook through

### Step 5

While the basa is cooking, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Slice the remaining non-zested lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 6

Once the basa is nearly cooked through, add your Chinese rice wine, soft cheese and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>reserved starchy pasta water to the pan and cook for 2 min

Wash your spinach, then add it to the pan along with the juice of the zested lemon (reserve the wedges for garnish!)

Season very generously with salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach is wilted, you are left with a loose sauce and your fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

### Step 8

Serve the lemony smoked basa & spinach gluten free linguine and top with the lemon zest and a generous grind of pepper

Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
