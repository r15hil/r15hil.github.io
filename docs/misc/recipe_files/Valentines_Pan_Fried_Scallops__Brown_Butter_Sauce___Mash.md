### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Re-boil a kettle

### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, add the hazelnuts to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until toasted

Once toasted, set aside to cool slightly

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks, then cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Chop the cooled hazelnuts roughly

Pat the king scallops dry with kitchen paper

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the scallops and cook for 2 min on one side, or until golden brown

Flip the scallops and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your scallops are cooked when they turn opaque

### Step 5

Return the potatoes to a low heat and mash until smooth

Keep covered until serving

### Step 6

Trim the woody ends off the asparagus spears

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Add the trimmed asparagus spears to a separate pot of boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once done, drain and return to the pan

### Step 7

Once the scallops are done, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat with 40g <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> butter

Cook for 2-3 min or until the butter starts to brown

Once brown, stir through the chopped parsley, juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and capers – this is your brown butter sauce

Return the scallops to the sauce and cook for 30 secs until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the scallops over the mash with the asparagus spears to the side

Spoon over the brown butter sauce and garnish with the chopped hazelnuts and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
