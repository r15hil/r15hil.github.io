## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs and trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and slice into rounds

Add the sliced potato and aubergine rounds to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion and cook for 3 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[175ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic, beluga lentils and your ground cinnamon and cook for 1 min until everything is combined

Add your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock, bay leaf[ves], dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook over a high heat for 3 min or until reduced – this is your lentil ragù


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time and cook for 4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add the grated cheese and a pinch of salt – this is your cheese sauce


### Step 7

Add the golden potato discs to an oven-proof dish in a single layer

Spoon over half of the lentil ragù

Then add the golden aubergine rounds in a single layer, followed by a final layer of lentil ragù

Top with the cheese sauce and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your melty Greek-style lentil moussaka

### Step 8

Once bubbling and golden, leave the melty Greek-style lentil moussaka to cool for 3 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the baby leaf salad to the side with a drizzle of olive oil and garnish with the chopped parsley

Tip: Watch out for the bay leaf[ves] and discard!

Enjoy!
