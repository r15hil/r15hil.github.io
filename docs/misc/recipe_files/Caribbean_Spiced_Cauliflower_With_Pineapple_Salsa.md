### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Cut the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small florets


Cut the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly


Add the ground allspice, smoked paprika, soy sauce, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a large bowl

### Step 2

Add the cauliflower florets to the mixed spices with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until evenly coated


Add the coated cauliflower and chopped red pepper to a baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – this is your Caribbean-spiced cauliflower and roasted red pepper

### Step 3

Meanwhile, rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)


Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Add the juice and zest of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and stir it all together – this is your lime dressing

### Step 5

Trim, then slice the spring onions finely


Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


Drain (save the juice for later!) and finely chop the pineapple

### Step 6

Combine the sliced spring onion, chopped coriander, pineapple, and red chilli (not a fan of spice? only add a little!) with a splash of the reserved pineapple juice and give everything a good mix up – this is your pineapple salsa


Drain and rinse the kidney beans

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2243-Step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, return it to a medium heat with the drained kidney beans and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans are warmed through – this is your cooked rice &amp; beans

### Step 8

Serve the Caribbean-spiced cauliflower over the cooked rice &amp; beans


Top with pineapple salsa and roasted red pepper


Drizzle the lime dressing all over


Enjoy!
