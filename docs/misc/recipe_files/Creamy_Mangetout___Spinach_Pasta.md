## Ingredients

- Creamy single soy (200ml)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Garlic clove
- Mangetout (80g)
- Farfalle (200g)
- Spinach (80g)
- Farfalle (100g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

While the pasta is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your mangetout in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your creamy single soy to the pan with your vegetable stock mix, Dijon mustard and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 5

Add the halved mangetout and cook for 2-3 min or until tender

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once tender, add the spinach and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1 min or until wilted


### Step 7

Once done, add the cooked farfalle to the pan and give everything a good mix up so everything is evenly coated – this is your creamy mangetout & spinach farfalle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your pasta is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mangetout & spinach farfalle

Season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
