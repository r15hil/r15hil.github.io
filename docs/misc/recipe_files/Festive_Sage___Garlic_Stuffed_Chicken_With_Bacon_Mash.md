## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a full kettle and take some butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then heat a large pot with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp, then transfer the cooked bacon lardons to a plate and reserve the pot


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>softened butter to a bowl with the chopped garlic and half your dried sage (you’ll use the rest later!) and mix it all together – this is your sage & garlic butter

Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of your chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Fill the pocket[s] with the sage & garlic butter – this is your stuffed chicken


### Step 3

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and add a handful of flour to a plate with a pinch of salt

Combine your panko breadcrumbs with the remaining dried sage and a small drizzle of olive oil on a large plate

Coat the stuffed chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the milk and then firmly press into the seasoned breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over


### Step 4

Transfer the stuffed chicken, butter-side up, to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sage & garlic stuffed chicken

Carefully wipe the reserved pot with some kitchen paper (it will be hot!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to the reserved pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender, golden and crisp

Chop your orange[s] into wedges and add your dried cranberries to a pot with the juice of your orange[s] and your cranberry sauce, bring to a boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your cranberry orange sauce


### Step 7

When the chicken is almost done, return the drained potatoes to the pot over a low heat with a small knob of butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

Add the reserved bacon lardons to the pot, mix it all together and cook for a final 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your bacon mash

### Step 8

Serve the sage & garlic stuffed chicken with the bacon mash and roasted Tenderstem to the side

Serve the cranberry orange sauce to the side

Enjoy!
