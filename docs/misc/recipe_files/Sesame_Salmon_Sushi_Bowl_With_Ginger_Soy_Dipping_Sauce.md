## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get perfectly fluffy rice!


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Peel lengths off your cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons and cucumber ribbons to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – these are your quick-pickled carrot & cucumber ribbons


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Combine the chopped ginger with your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl – this is your ginger & soy dipping sauce


### Step 5

Chop your salmon fillet[s] into cubes (discard the skin)

Mix your black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds together in a bowl with a pinch of salt

Add the salmon cubes to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the salmon cubes are coated all over – this is your coated salmon


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated salmon and cook for 6-8 min, stirring occasionally until the salmon is cooked through – this is your sesame salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the blanched edamame beans to a bowl and microwave for 1 min, or until hot and cooked with a bite

Trim your spring onion[s], then slice widthways into quarters

Chop each quarter into 4 pieces lengthways – this is your shredded spring onion

### Step 8

Top the sticky rice with the sesame salmon, warmed edamame beans, quick-pickled carrot & cucumber ribbons and shredded spring onion – this is your sesame salmon sushi bowl

Serve the sesame salmon sushi bowl with the ginger & soy dipping sauce and sriracha (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the side

Enjoy!
