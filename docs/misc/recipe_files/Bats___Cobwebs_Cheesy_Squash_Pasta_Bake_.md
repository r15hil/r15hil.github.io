### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the tomato wedges to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a little drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until beginning to blister, once done, remove the tray from the oven and set aside


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, combine your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Once the onion has softened, add your butternut squash cubes and dried oregano and cook for a further 2-3 min

Add the creamy stock and chopped tomatoes and cook, covered, over a high heat for 5-6 min or until the squash has begun to soften – this is your squash & tomato sauce


### Step 4

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 5-6 min

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving 80ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your Italian hard cheese

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Add the drained farfalle to the squash & tomato sauce with the reserved pasta water and give everything a good mix up

Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish


### Step 7

Top the pasta mixture with the roasted tomato wedges

Add the torn mozzarella and grated Italian hard cheese 

Put the pasta bake in the oven for 10-12 min or until melted and golden – this is your bats & cobwebs cheesy squash pasta bake
