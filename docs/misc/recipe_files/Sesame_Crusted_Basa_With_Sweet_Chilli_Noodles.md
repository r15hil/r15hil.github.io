### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Spread the miso paste evenly over the basa fillets with the back of a teaspoon

### Step 2

Sprinkle all the sesame seeds over the basa fillets and press down firmly with your hand so that they stick

Drizzle the fish with vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your sesame-crusted basa

Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily!

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Add the chopped ginger to a bowl with the soy sauce, chilli relish, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime

Give everything a good old mix up – this is your sweet chilli dressing
