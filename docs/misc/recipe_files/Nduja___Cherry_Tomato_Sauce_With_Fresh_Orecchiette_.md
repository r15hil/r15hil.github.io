## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min


### Step 3

Add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130ml</span>] boiled water


### Step 5

Add the sliced garlic and your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the tomatoes and cook for 3-4 min, breaking up the 'Nduja with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Tear half of your basil leaves (save the rest for garnish!) into the pan along with the chicken stock and give everything a good mix up – this is your 'Nduja & cherry tomato sauce


### Step 7

Add the drained orecchiette to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your 'Nduja & cherry tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette

### Step 8

Serve the 'Nduja & cherry tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette topped with your grated Italian hard cheese and tear over the remaining basil leaves

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
