## Instructions


### Step 1

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the tofu into bite-sized pieces and add to a bowl with your soy sauce

Give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your marinated tofu


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and roughly chop your garlic


### Step 3

Add half your blanched peas and half your chives (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with the chopped garlic, dried oregano, Dijon mustard, vegetable stock mix and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk

Blitz until smooth – this is your pea & chive sauce


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated tofu to the pan and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Whilst the tofu is cooking, chop the remaining chives finely


### Step 5

Once the tofu is golden, add the chopped courgette to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until softened

Whilst the courgette is cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml] </span>starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Once softened, transfer the courgette and tofu to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan

Return the pan to a medium heat and add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk in the pea & chive sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, return the cooked courgette and tofu to the pan with the drained tortiglioni, remaining blanched peas and reserved starchy pasta water

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min further or until everything has warmed through and is coated in sauce – this is your creamy tofu, pea & courgette tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the creamy tofu, pea & courgette tortiglioni in bowls

Garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!
