## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain and rinse your black beans

Combine the drained black beans with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – these are your BBQ black beans

Cut your sweet pointed pepper[s] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)


### Step 2

Transfer the pepper halves to an oven-proof dish and load them up with the BBQ black beans

Drizzle the peppers with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the peppers are tender


### Step 3

While the peppers are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic, drained sweetcorn, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), cornflour, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> flour and egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a bowl and mix everything together

Crumble in your feta, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir to combine – this is your fritter mixture


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 2 per person and cook for 4 min on one side then 2 min on the other until golden and cooked through – these are your sweetcorn fritters


### Step 6

While the fritters are cooking, chop your chives finely

Combine most of the chopped chives (save some for garnish!) with your mayo

Add a little splash of cold water to loosen and season with a crack of black pepper – this is your herby mayo


### Step 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the tomato wedges and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad

### Step 8

Serve the sweetcorn fritters with the BBQ stuffed peppers to the side and a dollop of herby mayo

Serve the tomato salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
