## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your potato[es] (skin on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]


### Step 2

Heat a pot with a matching lid over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly caramelised


### Step 3

Whilst the chorizo is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 4

Once the chorizo is caramelised, add the sliced onion to the pot with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the sliced garlic and dried thyme with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped potato and diced carrot with the drained cannellini beans and give everything a good mix up

Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the veg is tender


### Step 6

Once the veg is almost tender, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, spread a knob of butter over the ciabatta halves


### Step 7

Once the veg is tender, remove the pot from the heat and stir through your soft cheese with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy chorizo & bean stew

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chorizo & bean stew with the ciabatta halves to the side

Enjoy!
