### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, peel and cut half your brown onion[s] into rough bite-sized pieces (save the rest for later!)

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Add the chopped onion, garlic and ginger to a food processor with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blitz until smooth – this is your ginger & garlic paste

### Step 4

Add your beef strips to a large bowl with the ginger & garlic paste, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate

### Step 5

While the beef is marinating, slice the remaining onion finely

Top, tail peel and chop your carrot[s] into thin batons

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped vegetables with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until they're tender with a slight bite

Once done, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1-1617029807773-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated beef (with the remaining marinade) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the beef is browned all over and slightly pink on the inside

Return the cooked vegetables to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your beef bulgogi

### Step 8

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Serve the sticky rice with the beef bulgogi to the side and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
