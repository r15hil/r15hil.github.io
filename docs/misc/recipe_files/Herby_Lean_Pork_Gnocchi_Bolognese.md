## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi


### Step 4

Add your Marmite to the pan with your dried oregano, dried basil, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Add your chopped tomatoes with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[140ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml] </span>boiled water, a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until the lean pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency

Note: Please make sure you cook your pork mince thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through the drained gnocchi – this is your herby lean pork gnocchi bolognese


### Step 7

Tear your basil leaves over the herby lean pork gnocchi bolognese

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the herby lean pork gnocchi bolognese with your grated Italian hard cheese and salad to the side

Enjoy!
