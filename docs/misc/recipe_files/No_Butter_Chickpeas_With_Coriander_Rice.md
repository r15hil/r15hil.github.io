## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Combine your butternut squash cubes and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>garam masala (save the rest for later!) on a baking tray with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up then put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the squash is golden and tender


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) on a medium heat with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>butter alternative

Once the butter has melted, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened and starting to caramelise


### Step 4

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Once softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic to the pan with the drained chickpeas, ground turmeric, ground coriander, tomato paste and remaining garam masala and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [425ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your no butter curry sauce


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with salt – this is your coriander rice


### Step 7

Once the butternut squash is tender, remove the tray from the oven and add the roasted squash to the curry sauce

Stir until everything is well coated – this is your no butter chickpeas

### Step 8

Serve the no butter chickpeas over the coriander rice

Enjoy!
