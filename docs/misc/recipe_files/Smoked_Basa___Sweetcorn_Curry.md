## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 8-10 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) you garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and most of the chopped chilli (save some for garnish!) to the pan with the curry powder and ground turmeric

Increase the heat to medium and cook for 3 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your sweetcorn

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 375ml <span class="text-purple">[560 ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Add the drained sweetcorn to the pan with the coconut stock and cook for 4 min or until beginning to thicken

Meanwhile, cut the smoked basa fillets into bite-sized pieces

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Add the smoked basa pieces and spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for 4 min or until the spinach has wilted and the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Remove the lid from the pan and gently stir the curry

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your smoked basa & sweetcorn curry

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa & sweetcorn curry to the side of the brown rice

Garnish with the reserved chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
