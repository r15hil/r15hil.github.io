### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 2 min or until starting to brown, then transfer to a bowl and set aside, reserve the pan

### Step 4

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add your chicken thighs with the sliced onion, pepper strips and a generous pinch of salt

Add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and ground smoked paprika with your chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Mix everything together and cook the chicken for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

### Step 5

Once lightly browned, add a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky pulled chicken

### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are done, push them into 1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with the cooked chorizo and grated cheese and return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min or until the cheese has melted

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the shredded lettuce, chopped coriander and chopped mint

Top with smoky pulled chicken and dollop over your soured cream

Serve with the cheesy chorizo potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
