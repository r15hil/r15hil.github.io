## Ingredients

- 250g pak choi

- 10g sesame seeds
- 28g honey
- 2 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g ginger
- 2 soy sauce sachets
- 2 tbsp hoisin sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Add the rice, plenty of water and salt (optional) to a pot with a lid on a high heat and bring to the boil


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook with the lid on for 15-20 min or until tender


Check occassionally and once done, drain and set aside until serving


### Step 2

Peel and grate the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon)


Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves


Cut the tofu block in two and pat it dry with a clean teatowel or kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic to the rice and continue to cook


Mix the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, honey and grated ginger together with a good grind of pepper


This is your marinade


### Step 4

Heat a large wide based pan with a matching lid (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil


When hot, add the tofu and cook over a high heat for 2 min on each side until golden&nbsp;


Remove the tofu from the heat and transfer it to a plate, then wipe the pan clean with kitchen towel (reserve it for step 7)


### Step 5

Cut 4 <span class="text-danger">(8)</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper


Lay each tofu steak in the middle of 2 <span class="text-danger">(4)</span> pieces of foil (doubling the foil prevents any leakages!)


Spoon the marinade over the tofu and scrunch the edges of the foil together to form a sealed parcel, then place them on a baking tray and put then in the oven for 15 min&nbsp;


### Step 6

Chop the spring onions finely, discarding the roots


Cut the pack choi in half, lengthways


### Step 7

Heat the reserved pan from step 4 on a high heat


Add the pak choi (cut side down) and cook for 5 min or until caramelised without stirring


Add a lid and cook for 3-4 min further until cooked but retaining a slight crunch


Stir the chopped spring onion through the drained rice

### Step 8

Serve the tofu and sauce with the rice and pak choi to the side


Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the tofu steak for pretty presentation


Enjoy!
