Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin

### Step 2

Add the sliced onion, pepper strips, bashed lemongrass and star anise to a deep baking tray (or oven-proof dish) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 5-10 min or until the onion has started to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, ground paprika, Thai red curry paste, and a pinch <span class="text-danger">[2 pinches]</span> of sugar in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water – this is your Thai red curry stock

### Step 4

Pour the Thai red curry stock over the vegetables, add the lime leaves and cook for 10-15 min further or until the sauce has started to thicken

### Step 5

While the sauce is thickening, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 6

Once the sauce has started to thicken, add the pollock fillets to the sauce and cook for 10-12 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Season to taste with a pinch of salt

### Step 7

Once done, remove the lemongrass, star anise and lime leaves and discard – this is your coconut & lemongrass baked pollock curry

### Step 8

Serve the coconut & lemongrass baked pollock curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Sprinkle over the crispy onions

Enjoy!
