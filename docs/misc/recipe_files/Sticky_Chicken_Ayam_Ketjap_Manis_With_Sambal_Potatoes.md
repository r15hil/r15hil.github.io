### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper lined-baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until starting to crisp

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Add your lime leaf[ves] to a small bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside to soften for 2-3 min, then slice finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and sliced lime leaf[ves] and cook for 2-3 min or until golden

Tip: Watch the garlic like a hawk to make sure it doesn’t burn!

Once golden, transfer to kitchen paper, set aside and reserve the pan for later – this is your crispy garlic & lime leaf

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry

Once hot, add your chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium high, then flip and cook them for a further 8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

Trim and chop your spring onion[s] in half, then cut lengthways into thin strips

Tip: Soak the spring onion strips in ice cold water and they will curl up!

Combine your cornflour, ketjap manis and ginger paste with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water – this is your ketjap manis sauce

### Step 6

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once your potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, stir your sambal through the potatoes and push them to one side

Add the sliced pepper and chopped green beans to the other side of the tray[s] and return to the oven for 7-8 min or until the veg has cooked through

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the ketjap manis sauce and cook for a further 2 min or until sticky and coated – this is your sticky chicken ayam ketjap manis

Drain the spring onion strips

### Step 8

Serve the sticky chicken ayam ketjap manis with the sambal potatoes and roasted veg to one side

Spoon over any remaining ketjap manis sauce

Garnish with the crispy lime leaf & garlic and the spring onion strips

Enjoy!
