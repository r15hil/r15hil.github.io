### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 14-16 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Add the Brussels sprouts to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop as finely as you can with a knife

Chop the dried cranberries roughly

### Step 3

Once the potatoes have steam dried, mash them until smooth

Add the chopped Brussels sprouts, chopped cranberries and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add half of the cornflour (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your potato mix

### Step 4

Shape the potato mix into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24] </span>small croquettes

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the croquettes to the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and coat them in a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 17-20 min or until lightly golden

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1631106540196-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate the brie

Grate the cheddar cheese

Peel and grate the garlic

Slice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

### Step 6

Once the croquettes have had an initial 17-20 min, turn them over so they cook evenly

Add the walnuts to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drizzle most of the honey over the walnuts (save the rest for later!)

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven and cook for a final 5-6 min – these are your  sprout & cranberry croquettes and honey roasted walnuts

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1631106546819-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the grated cheeses and garlic to a pot with the remaining cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk, the rosemary (whole) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and gently cook over a medium-low heat, stirring frequently

Cook for 3-4 min or until the cheeses have melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your brie & cheddar fondue

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To serve, drizzle the red wine vinegar and a little olive oil over the baby leaf salad and top with the apple slices and honey roasted walnuts

Serve the sprout & cranberry croquettes with a skewer to the side (for dipping!)

Discard the rosemary from the brie & cheddar fondue

Serve the cheese fondue in a small bowl, drizzle over the remaining honey and enjoy!
