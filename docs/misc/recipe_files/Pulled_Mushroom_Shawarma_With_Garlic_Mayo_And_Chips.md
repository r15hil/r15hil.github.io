## Ingredients

- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms (90g) x0
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms (180g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Living lettuce
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced red onion to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – this is your quick-pickled red onion


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until browned


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel lengths off your cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 5

Combine your grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with your mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have browned, add your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if the pan is looking a little dry

Add your wholemeal pittas to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to a clean board and shred apart using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling' – these are your spiced pulled mushrooms

Remove the base of your living lettuce

Wash the living lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the living lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves

### Step 8

To assemble, load the toasted pittas with the spiced pulled mushrooms, quick-pickled red onion and cucumber ribbons – these are your pulled mushroom shawarmas

Top the pulled mushroom shawarmas with a dollop of garlic mayo and serve with the chips and lettuce leaves to the side

Enjoy!
