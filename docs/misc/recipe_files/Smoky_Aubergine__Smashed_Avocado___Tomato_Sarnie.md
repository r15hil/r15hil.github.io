### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Combine your soy sauce with your ground smoked paprika, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and a grind of black pepper in a large bowl – this is your 'bacon' flavouring

Trim the stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut in half lengthways

Slice each half, lengthways, as finely as you can (approx. 0.5cm in thickness)

### Step 2

Add the aubergine slices to the 'bacon' flavouring and give everything a good mix up until the aubergine is fully coated (clean hands is the best way!)

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper, add the coated aubergine and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until starting to crisp – this is your smoky aubergine

Add the wedges to a separate baking tray with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min, or until cooked through and golden

### Step 7

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until it's hot and crusty

Carefully slice in half before serving

Spread the warmed ciabatta with half the Dijon mayo and layer up with the lettuce leaves, tomato slices, smoky aubergine and smashed avocado – this is your smoky aubergine, smashed avocado & tomato sarnie

Serve the potato wedges, shredded lettuce and remaining Dijon mayo to the side

Enjoy!
