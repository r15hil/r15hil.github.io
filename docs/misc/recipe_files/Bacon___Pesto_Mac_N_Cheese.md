## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a drizzle of olive oil and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked macaroni and set aside until later


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 4

Gradually whisk 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-6 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Combine 1/4 of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) with your panko breadcrumbs and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs


### Step 6

Wash your spinach then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach and drained macaroni to the pan with the béchamel sauce

Stir through your pesto, grated cheddar and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up until the cheese has melted and the spinach has wilted


### Step 7

Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish

Top with the cheesy breadcrumbs followed by your smoked streaky bacon and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until it is golden and bubbling and the bacon is crisp – this is your bacon & pesto mac 'n' cheese

Tip: Put the dish on the top shelf of the oven to help crisp up the bacon!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Dress the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Serve your bacon & pesto mac 'n' cheese with a generous grind of black pepper and the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
