## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Slice your chestnut mushrooms


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) and add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and browned

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once browned, add the chicken breast portions<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs further

Add the chicken stock and whisk until smooth

Cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and chop your sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and bring to the boil, cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot, covered to keep warm

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> butter and a pinch of salt to the potatoes and mash them until smooth


### Step 5

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, add your soft cheese, Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your pie filling


### Step 6

Add the pie filling to an oven-proof dish

Top with the mashed sweet potato (reserve the pan!) and sprinkle over the panko breadcrumbs

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your sweet potato-topped chicken & mushroom pie

Reboil a kettle


### Step 7

While the pie is cooking, wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to the reserved sweet potato pan and cover with boiling water and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until tender

### Step 8

Leave the sweet potato-topped chicken & mushroom pie to stand for 5 min then serve with the sliced spring greens to the side

Winner!
