## Description

This light, summery dish brings out the best in fabulous British hake. A hot pan will give the fish deliciously crisp skin, which works really well with the butter bean purée. You'll make a salsa verde with sultanas and pine nuts to complete the dish perfectly. (Gluten and dairy-free, suitable for coeliacs.)

## Ingredients

- 180g heritage tomatoes
- 1 bag of pine nuts
- 1/2 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 2 x 125g hake fillets
- 1 can of butter beans
- 5g parsley
- 10g basil
- 15g capers
- 1 garlic clove
- 30g sultanas
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Start the salsa verde


Boil a kettle.


Chop the parsley and basil finely (including the stalks).


### Step 2

Add the remaining ingredients 


Add the pine nuts, capers and sultanas to the chopped herbs and chop everything together as finely as you can.


### Step 3

Finish the salsa verde


Add the mix to a bowl with the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil.


Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your salsa verde.


### Step 4

Start the butter bean purée


Dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water.


Peel and chop the garlic roughly.


### Step 5

Finish the butter bean purée


Drain and rinse the butter beans and add them to a food processor.


Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) with the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon, vegetable stock and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil.


Blitz until smooth – this is your butter bean pureé.


Tip: If you don't have a food processor, you can mash the beans instead.


### Step 6

Cook your fish 


Pat the hake dry with kitchen towel. Season with a pinch of salt.


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat. Once very hot, add the hake, skin-side down, and cook for 4-5 minutes or until the skin has started to crisp.


Flip the fish and cook for 1-2 minutes further or until cooked through. Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily.


### Step 7

Prepare your heritage tomatoes


Slice the heritage tomatoes in half.


Season with a generous pinch of salt.

### Step 8

Serve up!


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges.


Serve the pan-fried hake over the butter bean pureé with the heritage tomatoes to the side.


Drizzle the salsa verde over and garnish with a lemon wedge.


Enjoy!
