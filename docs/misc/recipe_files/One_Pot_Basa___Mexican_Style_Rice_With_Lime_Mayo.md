### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Add the chopped shallot and chopped pepper to the dish

### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste, your roasted garlic paste and a generous pinch of salt – this is your smoky stock

### Step 5

Add half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to the dish with your basmati rice

Add your smoky stock with your chopped tomatoes, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, top with your basa fillet[s] and sprinkle over the remaining ground smoked paprika and a pinch of pepper

### Step 6

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the rice is cooked and the fish is cooked through – this is your one pot basa & Mexican-style rice

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Combine your mayo and the juice of half your lime[s] with a pinch of pepper – this is your lime mayo

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the one pot basa & Mexican-style rice and drizzle over the lime mayo

Garnish with your crispy onions and a lime wedge

Dig in!
