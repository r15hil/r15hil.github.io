### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the hake, skin-side down, with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the skin has started to crisp


Flip the fish and cook for 1-2 min further or until cooked through


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 4

Once the hake is done, transfer it to a plate and cover with tin foil to keep warm


Return the pan to a very low heat and add the soft cheese and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up until fully combined


Cook for 5-6 min or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency

### Step 5

Add the green beans to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender


Tip: alternatively, to save on washing up, add these to the potato pot when they are 4-5 min from being done!


Once done, drain the cooked beans

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the <span class="text-highlight">juice</span> of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon and the chopped parsley


Season with a pinch of salt – this is your parsley sauce


Tip: add a splash more water if it looks a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the hake over the mashed potato with the green beans to the side


Pour the parsley sauce over and garnish with a wedge of lemon


Enjoy!
