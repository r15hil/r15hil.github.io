## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and sliced pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min or until the pepper has softened


### Step 3

While the pepper is softening, reboil half a kettle

Drain and rinse your black beans

Drain your sweetcorn

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar flavour block

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 5

Once the pepper has softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour, your chipotle paste, ground coriander and tomato paste

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant, then add the drained black beans, sweetcorn and vegetable stock

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened, then transfer to an oven-proof dish – this is your pie filling


### Step 6

Meanwhile, trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the halved green beans to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of pepper, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!) and add to a baking tray – this is your bean parcel


### Step 7

Add a knob of butter and a splash of milk to the potatoes and mash until smooth, then stir through the sliced spring onion and a pinch of salt – this is your spring onion mash

Top the pie filling with the spring onion mash and grated cheeze, put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through and the top has lightly browned – this is your cheezy plant-based Mexican-Style pie

Add the bean parcel to the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until tender

### Step 8

Serve the cheezy plant-based Mexican-Style pie with the green beans to the side

Tip: Drizzle over any remaining juices from the foil parcel!

Enjoy!
