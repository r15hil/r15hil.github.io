## Ingredients

- Sea bass fillet x0
- Sea bass fillets (2pcs)
- Traditional Italian pesto (45g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Rocket (20g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Trim your green beans

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skins


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for an initial 10 min

After 10 min, add the green beans to the pot

Cook the potatoes and green beans together for a further 5-7 min, or until tender

Once tender, drain and allow to cool slightly


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for for 3 min or until they are blistered - these are your blistered tomatoes

Once the tomatoes are blistered transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan for later


### Step 4

Combine your pesto and half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) in a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic pesto dressing


### Step 5

Wipe the reserved pan with some kitchen paper and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Pat your sea bass dry and season on both sides with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the seasoned sea bass fillet[s], skin side down with the crushed garlic and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the blistered tomatoes, green beans and potatoes to the bowl with the balsamic pesto dressing and give everything a good mix up – these are your pesto dressed vegetables


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the cooked sea bass over the pesto dressed vegetables

Top the sea bass with the rocket and drizzle with remaining balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil

Enjoy!
