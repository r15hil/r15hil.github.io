### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and<span class="text-danger"> </span>garlic

Chop your smoked streaky bacon roughly

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to crisp

Once crisp, reduce the heat to low, add the chopped onion and chopped garlic and cook for 10-15 min or until everything is beginning to caramelise

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your sweet potato fries

### Step 4

Crack your egg[s] into a bowl with the remaining ground smoked paprika and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Coat your chicken breast portion[s] in the beaten egg, then press firmly into the panko breadcrumbs until evenly coated – this is your breaded chicken

### Step 5

Add the breaded chicken to a separate baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil (this will stop them sticking!)

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy breaded chicken

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1602249192736-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the onion has caramelised, add your cider vinegar, honey and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water to the pan

Increase the heat to medium and cook for a further 5 min or until a sticky sauce has formed – this is your bacon jam

Tip: Watch the jam like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half, then add to a baking tray (cut-side up) and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1602249233020-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a pot and cover them with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until they’re tender and have turned bright yellow

Once done, drain the cobettes, return them to the pot and add a knob of butter – these are your buttery sweetcorn cobettes

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, sandwich the crispy breaded chicken, bacon jam and a dollop of mayo inside the warmed brioche halves – this is your American-style chicken burger with bacon jam

Serve the sweet potato fries and a buttery sweetcorn cobette to the side

Enjoy!
