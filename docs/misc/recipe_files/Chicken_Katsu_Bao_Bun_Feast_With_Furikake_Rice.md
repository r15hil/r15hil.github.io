### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs and set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min, then remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Trim, then chop your spring onions into batons

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and spring onion batons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp, then set aside and reserve the pan

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl, then add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, then add to the milk and firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over

### Step 4

Heat the reserved pan with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan!) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the outside is golden

On a clean board, slice the breaded chicken finely into strips – this is your chicken katsu (cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!)

### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Add the smashed cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1687441309023-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Combine your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour in a measuring jug

Gradually stir in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water, chopped creamed coconut, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> sugar and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the jug in the microwave for 2 min, stirring halfway, or until the sauce has thickened – this is your katsu sauce

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the crispy mushrooms & spring onion to the pan

Stir through the remaining soy sauce, most of your seaweed flakes and most of your toasted sesame seeds (save some for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your furikake rice

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

### Step 8

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the chicken katsu and top with some of the katsu sauce – these are your chicken katsu bao buns

Serve the chicken katsu bao buns with the furikake rice, quick-pickled cucumber and any remaining katsu sauce to the side

Garnish the rice with the reserved toasted sesame seeds and seaweed flakes

Enjoy!
