### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until caramelised

### Step 3

Dissolve the tomato paste, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[650ml]</span> boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped garlic, baharat and butternut squash cubes and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

Reboil a kettle

Once fragrant, add the harissa stock, drained chickpeas and diced apricots and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the sauce has thickened and the squash is tender – this is your chickpea, butternut squash & apricot tagine

Season with a pinch of salt

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 5

Dissolve the remaining vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl with the ground turmeric and vegetable stock, cover and set aside

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the flaked almonds and cook for 1-2 min or until browned all over

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 7

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop most of them finely, discarding the stems (save some whole leaves for garnish!)

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the couscous is done, add the chopped coriander and mint with a drizzle of olive oil, then fluff with a fork – this is your minty couscous

### Step 8

Serve the chickpea, butternut squash & apricot tagine over the minty couscous

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds and reserved mint leaves

Enjoy!
