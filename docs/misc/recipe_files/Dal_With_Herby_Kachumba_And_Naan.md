### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your curry powder, ground turmeric, ginger paste and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs

Drain and rinse your green lentils

### Step 5

While the lentils are cooking, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then chop finely

Chop your baby plum tomatoes in half

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Chop the mint leaves and coriander (including the stalks!) together roughly

### Step 6

Add the chopped cucumber, chopped herbs and halved baby plum tomatoes to a bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Add your white wine vinegar to the bowl with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby kachumba

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir your cultured coconut through the lentils – this is your dal

### Step 8

Serve the dal, with the herby kachumba and warmed naan to the side

Sprinkle over your nigella seeds

Enjoy!
