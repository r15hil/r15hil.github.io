### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly
