## Instructions


### Step 1

Top, tail, peel and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced carrot and sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water

Once the leeks have softened, add the curry powder, ground turmeric and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the vegetable stock, chopped potatoes and the single soya and cook for 15-18 min or until the potatoes are almost fork-tender


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Add the haddock bites and spinach to the potatoes and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through and the potatoes are fork-tender – this is your dairy-free curried haddock, leek & potato chowder
