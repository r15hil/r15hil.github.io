## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons to a small bowl with your rice vinegar and set aside for later – these are your quick-pickled carrot ribbons


### Step 2

Whilst the carrots are pickling, slice your chestnut mushrooms and keep your flat white mushrooms whole

Add the sliced chestnut mushrooms and whole flat white mushrooms to one side of a tray

Drizzle over your gluten free soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and give everything a gentle mix up until coated


### Step 3

Cut your broccoli into 3 wedges per person

Add the broccoli wedges to the other side of the tray (or use another tray!) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> [1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through, tender and golden – this is your soy mushrooms & roast broccoli


### Step 4

Meanwhile, rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add your quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-10 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving


### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger


### Step 6

Combine the grated ginger, your white miso paste, toasted sesame oil and agave with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Stir it all together – this is your miso dressing


### Step 7

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

### Step 8

Serve the soy mushrooms & roasted broccoli over the quinoa and drizzle the miso dressing all over

Drain the quick-pickled carrot ribbons and serve them to the side

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
