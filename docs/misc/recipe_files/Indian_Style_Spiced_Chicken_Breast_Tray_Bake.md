### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and add to a large bowl with your curry powder, half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your chicken breast portions and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated in the marinade, then refrigerate

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic with the side of a knife, keeping the skins on

### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes and red onion wedges to a large roasting tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Sprinkle over your ground turmeric and yellow mustard seeds

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together

Once everything has been cooking for 30 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, push the chicken to one side then add the spinach

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indian-style spiced chicken breast

Enjoy!
