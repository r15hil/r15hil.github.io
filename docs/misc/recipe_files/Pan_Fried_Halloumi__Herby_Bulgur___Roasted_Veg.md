### Step 6

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Add the halloumi strips and cook for 1-2 min or until crispy and golden brown on both sides – this is your pan-fried halloumi

### Step 7

While the halloumi is cooking, mix the capers and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your chilli-caper dressing

### Step 8

Serve the herby bulgur wheat with the roasted veg, and top with the pan-fried halloumi and chilli-caper dressing

Enjoy!
