## Ingredients

- 300g canned sweetcorn
- 0 mayonnaise
- 1 cheddar cheese
- 1 waxy potatoes
- 30g gochujang paste
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 1 green pepper
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 2

Add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 8-10 min, then drain and return to the pot with half your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mix it all together

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside to steam dry


### Step 3

Add the diced pepper and grated cheese to a bowl with the chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the drained sweetcorn and half your mayo (you'll use the rest later) – this is your cheesy corn mixture


### Step 4

Add the cheesy corn mixture to an oven-proof dish

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 20 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your Korean-style cheesy corn


### Step 5

Once the potatoes have steam dried, crush them lightly with a fork and then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Tip: You only want the potatoes lightly crushed, not mashed!

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until crispy – these are your gochujang potatoes


### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Add the remaining mayo to a bowl with the remaining gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>cold water – this is your chilli mayo

### Step 8

Serve the Korean-style cheesy corn with the gochujang potatoes and the baby leaf salad to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!
