### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the hot dog sausages to one side of a separate baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the sausages are cooked through

### Step 3

Meanwhile, zest the lime (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the zested lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Roughly chop the roasted peanuts

### Step 4

Combine the peanut butter and soy sauce in a small bowl with the red chilli relish, half of the chopped peanuts (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lime wedge<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>– this is your satay sauce

### Step 5

Add the mooli slaw mix and the chopped coriander to a large bowl with the juice of the remaining lime wedges, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled lime mooli slaw

### Step 6

Remove the sausage tray from the oven

Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun and add them to the other side of the tray

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until the hot dog buns are warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1691671453496-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the ground paprika and the lime zest to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the fries are golden and crisp add them to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – these are your paprika lime fries

### Step 8

Fill each hot dog bun with a hot dog sausage, then top with some satay sauce, remaining chopped peanuts, coriander leaves and some of the quick-pickled lime mooli slaw – these are your peanut satay hot dogs

Serve the paprika lime fries, the remaining lime-pickled mooli slaw and any remaining satay sauce to the side

Enjoy!
