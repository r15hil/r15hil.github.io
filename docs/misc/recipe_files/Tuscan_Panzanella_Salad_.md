## Description

This speedy traditional Tuscan salad is made using charred bread which may sound odd but it adds texture and satisfying weight while soaking up all the other flavours; namely capers, tomatoes and black olives. We love the name too. Make sure you present it with your finest Italian accent. Hey presto...it's 'PANZANELLA!
