## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] roughly


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and the chopped carrot to the dish with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a stir, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned


### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with your toasted sesame oil, a small pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sesame rice


### Step 5

Once the beef mince is lightly browned, add your ginger & garlic paste to the dish with your soy sauce, honey, Chinese rice wine and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

After 15 min add your Tenderstem broccoli and cook covered for a further 10 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your oven-baked honey & soy beef


### Step 6

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the oven-baked honey & soy beef topped with your toasted sesame seeds and chopped spring onion

Serve the sesame rice to the side
