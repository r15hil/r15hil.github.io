Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

While the mushrooms are cooking, add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and set aside in a bowl and reserve the pot for later

Wash your spring greens then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Enjoy!
