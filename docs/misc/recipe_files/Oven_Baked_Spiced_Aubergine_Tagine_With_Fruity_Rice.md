## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine and onion wedges to the dish with your butternut squash cubes

Add your baharat, tomato paste, roasted garlic paste and a very generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your chopped creamed coconut, chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix and umami seasoning

Add a knob of butter with a pinch of sugar and 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30-35 min or until the sauce has thickened and the aubergine has softened – this is your oven-baked spiced aubergine tagine


### Step 6

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with your chopped dates, a knob of butter and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Add a pinch of salt and cover tightly with tin foil, then put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your fruity rice


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the oven-baked spiced aubergine tagine with the fruity rice to the side

Chop your parsley roughly over the top with scissors

Garnish with your flaked almonds

Dig in!
