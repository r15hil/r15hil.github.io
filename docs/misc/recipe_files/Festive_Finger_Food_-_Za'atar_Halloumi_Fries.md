### Step 3

Chop all the vegetables and herbs together (Don't use all the chilli if you can't handle the heat!) on the board or until a fine mixture remains


Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil with the chilli jam and season generously with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato-chilli salsa

<span class="text-highlight">Slice the halloumi widthways into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> equal-sized strips </span>


Then slice each strip i<span class="text-highlight">n half</span> so you are left with 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> equally shaped halloumi strips

Add the sesame seeds, ground cumin, dried thyme, sumac and <span class="text-highlight">dried</span> oregano to a <span class="text-highlight">pestle &amp; mortar</span> with a pinch of salt 


Grind into a coarse powder – this is your za'atar

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once very hot, add the halloumi strips and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and <span class="text-highlight">crispy (you may have to do this in batches)</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Once golden, place on</span> a<span class="text-highlight"> kitchen towel to drain off any excess oil – these are your za'atar halloumi fries</span>

### Step 8

Serve the za'atar halloumi fries with the tomato-chilli salsa to the side


Enjoy!
