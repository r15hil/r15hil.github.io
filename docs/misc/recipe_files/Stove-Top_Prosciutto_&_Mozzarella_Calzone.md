## Instructions

### Step 1

Add the dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix it all together and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the cherry tomatoes, a pinch of sugar and a crack of black pepper and cook for 5-6 min or until the tomatoes are starting to blister

Once blistered, transfer the cherry tomatoes to a bowl and reserve the pan

Add the balsamic vinegar to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – these are your balsamic tomatoes

### Step 3

Add the pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 60ml <span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

### Step 4

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go and knead it for 30 secs with floured hands

Roll out each dough ball to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a floured rolling pin into a circle shape – these are your pizza bases

### Step 5

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the tomato paste and dried basil to a small bowl with the truffle oil and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your truffle & tomato sauce

Spread the truffle & tomato sauce over only half of each pizza base, then top with the torn mozzarella and the sliced prosciutto

### Step 6

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pizza base (this will help to seal the dough!)

Fold the pizza base over the filling and seal firmly by pinching the dough together along the join, making sure there are no gaps – these are your calzones

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1680013407326-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wipe the reserved pan with kitchen paper, then return the dry pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the calzones and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden – these are your stove-top prosciutto & mozzarella calzones

While the calzones are cooking, wash the rocket and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the stove-top prosciutto & mozzarella calzones with the rocket to one side and spoon over the balsamic tomatoes

Enjoy!
