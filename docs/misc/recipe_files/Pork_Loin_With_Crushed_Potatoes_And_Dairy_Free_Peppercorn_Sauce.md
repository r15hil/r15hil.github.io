## Ingredients

- Creamy single soy (200ml)
- British pork loin steaks (300g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (160g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g) x0
- British pork loin steak (150g) x0
- Cracked black pepper (2.5g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then boil a full kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]


### Step 3

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned steak[s] and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Once done, transfer the cooked steak[s] to a plate to rest and reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2 min

Reboil a kettle


### Step 5

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, then add half your creamy single soy (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up

Add your cracked black pepper, Chinese rice wine and half your wholegrain mustard and bring to the boil over a high heat, then add any resting juices from the plate with the steak[s] and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your dairy-free peppercorn sauce

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining mustard for another meal!


### Step 6

Whilst the sauce is thickening, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a separate pot with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and season with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain the Tenderstem broccoli and return it to the pot


### Step 7

Add the remaining creamy single soy and a generous pinch of salt to the drained potatoes

Crush the potatoes lightly with a masher or the back of a fork – these are your crushed potatoes

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!

### Step 8

Serve the pork loin steak[s] over the dairy-free peppercorn sauce with the crushed potatoes and Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Enjoy!
