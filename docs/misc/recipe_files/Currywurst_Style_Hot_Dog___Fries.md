### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

### Step 2

Add the fries to the baking tray with half the ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Add the hot dog sausages to the other side of the baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through – these are your sausages and smoky fries

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with splash of cold water, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and half the white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has caramelised, then transfer to a plate and reserve the pan – this is your caramelised onion

### Step 4

Combine the carrot & cabbage slaw mix with half the mayo (you'll use the rest later!), the remaining white wine vinegar and a small pinch of salt and pepper – this is your slaw

Combine the remaining mayo and the mustard ketchup in a small bowl with a small splash of cold water – this is your mustard-mayo dip

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a low heat and add a knob of butter with most of the curry powder (save a small pinch for garnish!), ground turmeric and the remaining ground smoked paprika and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the Henderson's Relish, tomato ketchup and a splash of cold water and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your curry ketchup

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside

### Step 6

Once the sausages are cooked through, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and transfer them to a clean chopping board to cool slightly

Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun and add them to the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the buns are warmed through and the fries are golden

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1683880636624-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice the cooled sausages on the diagonal, into bite-sized pieces

Add the sliced sausages to the pan of curry ketchup and give everything a good mix up until well coated

Return the pan to a low heat and cook for 30 secs to reheat – these are your currywurst-style sausages

### Step 8

Fill each hot dog bun with the currywurst-style sausages, then top with the caramelised onion

Sprinkle over the reserved curry powder

Serve the smoky fries, slaw and mustard-mayo dip to the side

Enjoy!
