## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into batons

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into wedges


### Step 2

Add the pepper strips and chopped onion to a tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15-20 min until the veg has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the potato wedges and courgette batons to a separate tray (or two!) with your dried oregano, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through and crisp


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, boil half a kettle

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste and balsamic vinegar and give it a good mix up – this is your tomato stock

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 5

Once the pepper and onion have softened, remove the tray from the oven and add the halved cherry tomatoes and tomato stock

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray to the oven for a further 5-8 min – this is your roasted rainbow veg


### Step 6

Once everything is cooked, push the wedges and courgette batons into a pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with the roasted rainbow veg and any remaining tomato juices from the tray, then crumble over your feta

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-8 min or until the cheese has melted a little and is starting to brown

Once done, set aside for a few min to cool slightly – these are your rainbow veg loaded feta fries


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the rainbow veg loaded feta fries with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
