## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Whilst the meat-free mince is browning, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and rice vinegar in a bowl with a pinch of sugar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> water

Add the grated carrot, then give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your spicy carrot quick-pickle


### Step 4

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once the spinach is cool, squeeze as much water out of it as you can, then add it to a bowl with half of your toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sesame spinach


### Step 6

Once the meat-free mince has browned, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 2 min

Add your red chilli relish, gluten free soy sauce and remaining toasted sesame oil and give it a good mix up – this is your meat-free mince bulgogi


### Step 7

Drain the spicy carrot quick-pickle, discarding the pickling liquid

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free mince bulgogi over the cooked rice with the sesame spinach and spicy carrot quick-pickle to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
