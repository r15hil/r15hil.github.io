### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pat the free range chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt, add them to a baking tray and drizzle with vegetable oil (use tin foil to avoid mess!), then put the tray in the oven and cook for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 2

Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Trim, then slice your green beans finely

Slice your button mushrooms finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and green beans and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for a further 2-3 min

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until tender, then drain

Once drained, toss the noodles in your toasted sesame oil, then add them to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your Singapore-style noodles

### Step 7

Once the chicken thighs are done, remove from the oven and slice them finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the Singapore-style noodles and top with the sliced free range chicken thighs

Enjoy!
