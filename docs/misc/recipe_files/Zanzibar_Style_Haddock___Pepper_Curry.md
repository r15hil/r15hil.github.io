- 280g cooked white long grain rice
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into small bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the chopped pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Add the yellow mustard seeds, cumin seeds and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and roughly grind until the seeds are starting to break down – this is your ground spice mix

Add the ginger & garlic paste and ground spice mix to the pan with the ground paprika, ground turmeric and ground coriander and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Meanwhile, roughly chop the creamed coconut (if required!)

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with the tamarind paste and tomato paste – this is your tomato coconut stock


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the tomato coconut stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to thicken – this is your curry sauce


### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Chop the haddock bites into even, bite-sized pieces

Once slightly thickened, add the chopped haddock to the curry sauce and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Zanzibar-style haddock & pepper curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Zanzibar-style haddock & pepper curry over the cooked rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with the crispy onions

Enjoy!
