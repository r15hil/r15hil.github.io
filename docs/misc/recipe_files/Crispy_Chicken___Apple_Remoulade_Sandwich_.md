## Ingredients

- 40g panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Apple
- Ciabatta x2
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Parsley (10g)
- Parsley (5g) x0
- Shallot
- Sweet potato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dice your apple[s] (skin on) finely and discard the core[s]

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover them with a sheet of cling film then bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and pat dry with kitchen paper – this is your chicken escalope


### Step 4

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a shallow bowl with the chopped garlic and season with a pinch of salt – this is your garlic panko

Turn the chicken escalope in the garlic panko until fully coated – this is your garlic panko chicken

Tip: Press the chicken into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat them well


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the garlic panko chicken and cook for 5 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy garlic chicken

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and pop them in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Wash, then remove 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>outer leaves per person from your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper and set them aside for serving

Cut the inner core[s] into quarters

Combine the diced apple, chopped shallot, mayo, cider vinegar and chopped parsley in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper – this is your apple remoulade

### Step 8

Slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half

Fill the warmed ciabatta halves with the lettuce leaves, apple remoulade and crispy garlic chicken

Serve the sweet potato chips and lettuce quarters to the side

Dollop any remaining apple remoulade over the lettuce quarters

Enjoy!
