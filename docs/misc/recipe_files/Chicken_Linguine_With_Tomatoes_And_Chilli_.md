## Ingredients

- Chives (5g)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Linguine (190g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the cooked linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and set aside until later


### Step 2

While the pasta is cooking, reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add the chopped chicken and the halved cherry tomatoes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min further


### Step 5

Dissolve your tomato paste and chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop your chives finely


### Step 6

Reduce to a medium-high heat and add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs, then pour in the tomato stock

Cook for 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a pasta sauce-like consistency

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and remove from the heat


### Step 7

Stir through a generous knob of butter and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!)

Add the cooked linguine to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken linguine with tomatoes and chilli

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the chicken linguine with tomatoes and chilli and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
