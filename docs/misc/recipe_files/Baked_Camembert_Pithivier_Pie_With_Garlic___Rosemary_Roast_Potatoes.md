## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 160g puff pastry
- 120g camembert
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 3 white potatoes
- 40g cranberry sauce
- 5g rosemary
- 25g walnuts
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-10 min or until almost tender and once done, drain them in a colander and shake them until they're fluffy


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the walnuts roughly

Trim the green beans


### Step 3

Once the potatoes are ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the rosemary and thyme and 3/4 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 30 secs – this is your garlic & rosemary oil

Add the cooked potatoes to a baking tray, pour over the garlic & rosemary oil (reserve the pan) and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your rosemary & garlic roast potatoes


### Step 4

Score the camembert in a criss-cross pattern

Spread the remaining garlic over the scored camembert

Top with the cranberry sauce and half the chopped walnuts (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your loaded camembert


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> squares

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add 1<span class="text-danger"> [2]</span> pastry square<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the baking tray, prick all over with a fork (this will stop it getting a soggy bottom!) and top with the loaded camembert


### Step 6

Top with the remaining pastry square<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>,<span class="text-danger"> </span>pinch the edges of the pastry together and roll over tightly to form a border around the camembert

Score the pastry with a knife in a spiral shape, working from the centre outwards

Add the green beans with a sprinkle of water to the other side of the tray (or a separate one!) and cover with tin foil, then put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 15-17 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your baked camembert pithivier & roasted green beans


### Step 7

Once everything is nearly ready, return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add a knob of butter with the remaining chopped walnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until the walnuts are toasted

Remove the pan from the heat and add the balsamic vinegar

Add the roasted green beans to the balsamic walnuts and give everything a good mix up – these are your balsamic green beans

### Step 8

Serve the rosemary & garlic roast potatoes with the balsamic green beans to the side

Cut the baked camembert pithivier in half and serve over the potatoes (so they catch all the gooey melted camembert!)

Enjoy!
