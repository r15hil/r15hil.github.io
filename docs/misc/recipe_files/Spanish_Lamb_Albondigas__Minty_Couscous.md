## Ingredients

- 250g British lamb mince 
- 1 courgette
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 10g fresh mint 
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 tsp rich tomato paste 
- 120g golden couscous
- 1 tin of chopped tomatoes 
- 30g sultanas
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to a medium-high heat


Cut the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)


Add the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to a baking tray, skin-side up, and place them directly under the grill for 8-10 min or until the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> has blackened slightly (charring adds a smoky flavour!)


Once cooked, set aside to cool slightly


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine the lamb&nbsp;mince with the panko breadcrumbs, smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Mix thoroughly (clean hands are best!), then divide the mixture into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> pieces


Shape into meatballs


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned&nbsp;


Tip:&nbsp;over-crowding the pan can make the meatballs sweat, so cook them in batches if needed


Once browned, transfer the&nbsp;meatballs&nbsp;to a plate and keep the pan for later


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small pieces


Once cooled, cut the charred yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into strips


Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the diced red onion and&nbsp;chopped courgette&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


Once softened, add the meatballs and charred yellow pepper and cook for 1 min


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> chicken stock cube in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water


Stir in the tomato paste, chopped tomatoes and chicken stock and cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through - these are your Lamb Albondigas


Re-boil a kettle


### Step 7

Meanwhile, dissolve the remaining&nbsp;chicken stock cube in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water


Add the couscous and sultanas to a heat-proof bowl with the chicken stock, cover and set aside for 5-10 min or until all the stock has been absorbed


Strip the mint leaves from their stalks and chop finely


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Once cooked, fluff the couscous with a fork, then add half of the chopped mint and&nbsp;a knob of butter and mix through


Serve the Lamb Albondigas over the minty couscous and garnish with the remaining chopped mint


Enjoy!
