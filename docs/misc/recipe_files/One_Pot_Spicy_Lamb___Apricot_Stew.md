## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges


### Step 3

Add your lamb mince to the dish, breaking it up into rough, large chunks and cook for 2-3 min or until very lightly browned all over

Once browned, stir in 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour


### Step 4

Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into rough pieces

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Add the crushed garlic, chopped potatoes and onion wedges to the dish and stir everything together


### Step 6

Add your ground turmeric, baharat and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your beef stock mix, tomato paste and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat, then stir in your diced apricots


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 10 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

After 10 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped carrot, then return the dish to the oven, covered, for a further 15 min or until the carrot is tender and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 8

Once cooked, give everything a good mix up – this is your one pot spicy lamb & apricot stew

To serve, add a dollop of your natural yoghurt and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and chopped mint

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Dig in!
