### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water and add your soy sauce – this is your coconut stock

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 3

Once the chicken is browned, add your red Thai curry paste and chopped ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant add the coconut stock with a pinch of sugar and cook, covered, for a further 10-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the stock has thickened – this is your Thai-style coconut sauce

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your cucumber into disks, then slice each individual cucumber disk into matchsticks

Cut your lime[s] in half

Add the grated carrot and cucumber matchsticks to a large bowl

Add the juice of half your lime[s], your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt to the bowl and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your cucumber & carrot salad

### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your roasted peanuts coarsely

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, reduce the heat to low and transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling'

Squeeze the remaining lime into the Thai-style coconut sauce

Return the pulled chicken to the Thai-style coconut sauce and mix until the chicken is fully coated in sauce – this is your Thai-style coconut chicken

### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Divide the cucumber & carrot salad between the warmed tortillas

Top with the Thai-style coconut free range chicken

Garnish with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped roasted peanuts

Enjoy!
