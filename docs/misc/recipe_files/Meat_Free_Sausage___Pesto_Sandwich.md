## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt


### Step 2

Add your meat-free sausages to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through and golden


### Step 3

Whilst everything is in the oven, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Chop your cheddar cheese into small pieces

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks


### Step 4

Add the chopped basil, chopped garlic and cheddar cheese pieces to a food processor (alternatively, use a pestle & mortar)

Add half of your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and pepper and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Blitz together to form a coarse paste – this is your cheddar pesto


### Step 5

Slice your tomato[es] finely

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once everything is almost cooked, add your ciabatta[s] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Meanwhile, combine the remaining red wine vinegar with drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressing


### Step 7

Carefully slice your ciabatta[s] in half and spread with the cheddar pesto

Top with the sliced tomato, meat-free sausages and a small handful of salad – this is your sausage & pesto sandwich

### Step 8

Serve the sausage & pesto sandwich with the potato wedges and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the dressing

Enjoy!
