### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, your ground smoked paprika, and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the sweet potato is cooked through and starting to crisp

### Step 2

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Add the haddock bites to a bowl with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give them a good mix until the fish is nicely coated

### Step 3

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Add the coated haddock to the panko breadcrumbs and press firmly to coat evenly all over

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded haddock with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – this is your crispy chipotle haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!), the juice of half the lime[s], a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your lime mayo

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Add the salad, roasted sweet potato and sliced spring onion to a large bowl with the lime mayo and gently mix together – this is your zingy sweet potato salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chipotle haddock with the zingy sweet potato salad to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
