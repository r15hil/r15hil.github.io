Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, chopped garlic and torn mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

### Step 3

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into bite-sized pieces

Peel, then chop your potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato and carrot to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

### Step 4

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into<span class="text-danger"> </span>1 square per person

Add the pastry squares to the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your pie lids

### Step 5

Whilst the pie lids are cooking, cut your Brussels sprouts in half lengthways

Add them to a separate baking tray with your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15 min or until the sprouts are tender and slightly crispy – these are your balsamic roasted sprouts

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 6

Whilst the sprouts are cooking, dissolve your crème fraîche and soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Add the stock to the mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to a single cream-like consistency – these are your creamy mushrooms

Once thickened, strip your thyme leaves from their stems (discard the stems) into the pan with the creamy mushrooms and give everything a good mix up

### Step 7

Return the drained potato & carrot to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mash, then season generously with salt – this is your potato & carrot mash

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mushrooms with the potato & carrot mash and balsamic roasted sprouts to the side

Sit the pie lid over the creamy mushrooms

Enjoy!
