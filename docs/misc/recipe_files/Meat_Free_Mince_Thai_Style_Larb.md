### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s]

### Step 3

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped spring onion and cook for 5-6 min or until browned

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

### Step 4

While the meat-free mince is cooking, cut your lime[s] in half

Roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice roughly

### Step 5

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Add your cooked white long grain rice and ginger & garlic paste to the browned meat-free mince and cook for 2-3 min, breaking the rice up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and separate the outer leaves

Roughly shred the inner cores

### Step 7

Add your soy sauce, the juice of half the lime[s], sesame oil, shredded lettuce, sliced chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mint and coriander to the pan and give it a good mix up – this is your larb filling

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the lettuce leaves on plates and load them up with the larb filling

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
