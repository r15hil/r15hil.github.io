## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- Halloumi (200g)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Mini cosberg lettuce
- Mint sauce (20g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Chop your waxy potatoes in half and add to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Once fork-tender, add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and gently mix together – these are your buttery potatoes


### Step 3

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly chop


### Step 4

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!


### Step 5

Cut your halloumi into thick slices


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden


### Step 7

Add half the smashed cucumber (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with your yoghurt, mint sauce and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chunky tzatziki

### Step 8

Serve the halloumi with the buttery potatoes, chopped lettuce and chunky tzatziki to the side

Top the lettuce with the remaining smashed cucumber, then dress with a drizzle of olive oil, your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Drizzle your red chilli relish over the halloumi

Enjoy!
