### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes, apple wedges and onion wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to low and cook the onion for 7-8 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and chop (or grate!) your garlic

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

### Step 5

### Step 6

Pat your pork loin steaks dry with kitchen paper, then rub them with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the steaks and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through

Once done, transfer the cooked steaks to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 2 min

### Step 7

While the steaks are cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix and marmite in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock

Once the onion has caramelised, add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for a further 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your onion gravy

### Step 8

Slice the rested pork steak finely

Serve the sliced pork steak with the roast apple & potatoes and spring greens to the side

Pour the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!
