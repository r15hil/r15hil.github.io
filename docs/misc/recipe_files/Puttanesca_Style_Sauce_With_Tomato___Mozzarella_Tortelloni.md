## Ingredients

- Pitted black olives (60g)
- Tomato & mozzarella tortelloni (250g)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Capers (20g)
- Parsley (5g)
- Garlic clove x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your black olives in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your capers and halved olives to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min


### Step 6

Add your chopped tomatoes and season with a pinch of salt and sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce starts to thicken


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained tortelloni to the pan with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce â€“ this is your puttanesca-style sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick

### Step 8

Serve the puttanesca-style sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni topped with the remaining chopped parsley and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
