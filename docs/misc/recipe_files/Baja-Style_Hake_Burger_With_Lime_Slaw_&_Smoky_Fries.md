### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Peel and grate your garlic

### Step 2

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the grated garlic, dried oregano and half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the fries are well coated

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until lightly golden

### Step 3

Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Combine your mayo with the lime zest, a small squeeze of lime juice (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo

### Step 4

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with the remaining lime juice, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a drizzle of olive oil, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli-lime slaw

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1682084178076-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add your cornflour to a plate with the remaining ground smoked paprika and a very generous pinch of salt, and mix until fully combined

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Place the hake fillet[s] onto the floured plate, pressing firmly to coat evenly on both sides – this is your coated hake

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1682084182118-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

When the fries are almost ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your Baja-style hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1682084185622-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the fries are lightly golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven, push the fries to one side and add the brioche bun halves to the other side, cut-side down

Return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the brioche is warmed through and the fries are golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries

### Step 8

To build your burger, top a warmed brioche bun base with a Baja-style hake fillet, a drizzle of lime mayo, some of the chilli-lime slaw and a warmed brioche bun lid – this is your Baja-style hake burger

Serve the smoky fries and remaining chilli-lime slaw to the side

Enjoy!
