## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve half your vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[390ml] </span>boiled water

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your ground cumin and ground coriander with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 30 secs


### Step 6

Add the chopped sweet potato and drained chickpeas to the pot with the vegetable stock, chopped tomatoes, a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender, stirring occasionally – this is your spiced sweet potato & chickpea stew


### Step 7

Whilst the stew is cooking, add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water, the remaining vegetable stock mix and your sultanas

Stir it all together, then cover and set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed

Fluff with a fork before serving – this is your sultana couscous

### Step 8

Serve the spiced sweet potato & chickpea stew with the sultana couscous to the side

Enjoy!
