## Ingredients

- Panko breadcrumbs (20g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Leek
- Parsley (5g)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Chop your potatoes (skins on!) into small bite-sized pieces, then chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Chop your parsley as finely as you can, including the stalks


### Step 3

Combine your panko breadcrumbs and grated cheese in a bowl with a pinch of salt – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your mini roast potatoes


### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add to a baking paper-lined tray, then sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb mix evenly over the basa

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!

When the potatoes have 12-15 min left, put the tray[s] with the basa in the oven until the breadcrumbs are starting to turn golden and the basa is cooked through – this is your cheesy baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While everything's in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 7-8 min or until softened

Once softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your blanched peas to the pan with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Cook for 2-3 min or until the peas are warmed through – these are your pea greens

Meanwhile, add the chopped parsley to a bowl with the remaining chopped garlic, the softened butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your garlic butter

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy baked basa with the mini roast potatoes and pea greens to the side

Top the fish with the garlic butter

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the garlic butter or just add a little!</span>

Season with salt and pepper to taste

Enjoy!
