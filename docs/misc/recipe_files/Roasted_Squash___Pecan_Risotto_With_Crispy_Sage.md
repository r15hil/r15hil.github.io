### Step 2

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the squash is almost cooked through and beginning to turn golden

### Step 3

Whilst the squash is roasting, boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water

Once softened, add your arborio rice to the onion with the chopped garlic and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min

Add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 5

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel some of your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings, then grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your sage leaves and cook for 1 min or until crispy, then transfer to kitchen paper and set aside

### Step 6

Once the squash has had 15 min, add your pecans to the tray and return the tray to the oven for 5 min further or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once done, remove the roasted squash cubes and mash most of them up with a fork (save some for garnish!) to form a purée – this is your squash purée

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1719913125497-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is almost cooked, stir the squash purée and soft cheese through the risotto

Add the grated Italian hard cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted and the rice is cooked – this is your butternut squash risotto

### Step 8

Serve the butternut squash risotto topped with the cheese shavings, reserved roasted butternut squash, crispy sage leaves and toasted pecans

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
