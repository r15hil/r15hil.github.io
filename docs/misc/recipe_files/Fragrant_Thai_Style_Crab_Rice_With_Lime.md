### Step 2

Combine the red Thai curry paste, fish sauce, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water and stir until the sugar has dissolved – this is your Thai-style stock

### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the white long grain rice and Thai-style stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry and the rice isn't cooked yet!

### Step 5

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the mangetout to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until tender with a bite

Meanwhile, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Trim, then slice the spring onions finely

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, make a well in the centre of the pan and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into it

Break the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> up with a spatula then allow to set slightly before mixing it through the rice

Remove the pan from the heat and fluff the cooked rice with a fork

Stir through the chopped coriander and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your fragrant Thai-style rice

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant Thai-style rice in bowls

Top with the white crab meat, crispy onions and sliced spring onion

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
