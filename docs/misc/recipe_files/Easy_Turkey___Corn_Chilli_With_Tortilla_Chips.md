## Ingredients

- 150g canned sweetcorn
- 5.5g chicken stock mix 
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 32g tomato paste 
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 250g turkey mince
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 6 plain tortillas
- 20g chipotle paste 
- 1 spring onion 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the tortillas into triangles (layer them up for speedy chopping!)


### Step 2

Lightly oil a baking tray, then add the tortilla triangles (you may need two trays if they're crowded) and a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 7-9 min or until golden and crisp

Once done, remove from the oven and set aside – these are your tortilla chips

Tip: Watch the chips like a hawk, or they may burn!


### Step 3

While the tortilla chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the turkey mince and cook for 4 min or until crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon up as you go


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Dissolve the chicken stock mix, tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Drain and rinse the sweetcorn


### Step 5

Once the turkey mince is crisp, add the smoked paprika, ground coriander, ground cumin and cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 6

Once done, add the chipotle stock and drained sweetcorn to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 5-7 min or until you have a thick stew-like consistency

Season very generously with black pepper – this is your turkey & corn chilli


### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Trim and slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

### Step 8

Garnish the turkey & corn chilli with the grated cheese and the sliced spring onion

Serve the tortilla chips to the side

Enjoy!
