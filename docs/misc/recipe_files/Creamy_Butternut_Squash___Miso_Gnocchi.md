### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and golden

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, then boil half a kettle

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently, then transfer to a plate (reserve the pan for later!) – this is your golden panko

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 3

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut the lemon[s] in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the lemon zest and the golden panko – this is your lemony panko

### Step 4

### Step 5

Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Wash your cavolo nero, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once fragrant, tear the cavolo nero into the pan (discard any tough stalks) with a splash of cold water, a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min further or until starting to wilt

### Step 7

Once starting to wilt, add the creamy miso sauce and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add the roasted butternut squash and cooked gnocchi

Tear in your basil and the juice of half your lemon[s] – this is your creamy butternut squash & miso gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy cooking water if it’s looking a little dry

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the creamy butternut squash & miso gnocchi with the lemony panko over the top

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
