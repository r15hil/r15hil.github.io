### Step 1

Peel your garlic and ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Chop all of these together as finely as you can (can't handle the heat? Save some of the chilli for another recipe!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, ginger & chilli and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once the beef has started to brown, add the sticky stir-fry sauce to the pan with half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the drained noodles & broccoli and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky beef & broccoli wholewheat noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the sticky beef & broccoli wholewheat noodle stir-fry in bowls

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
