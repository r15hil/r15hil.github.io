### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s] and grate the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your beef mince and grated onion with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and using clean hands, give everything a good mix up until fully combined

### Step 2

Divide and shape the beef mince into 3 meatballs per person (clean hands is the best way!)

Heat a large pot with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the beef meatballs and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally, until they're browned on all sides

Once browned, transfer to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later (reserve the pot!)

### Step 3

While the meatballs are browning, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 450ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

### Step 4

Wipe the reserved pot clean and return it to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

### Step 5

Add your dried oregano, chopped tomatoes and red wine vinegar with the tomato stock and give everything a good mix up

Add half the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper, and bring to a boil over a high heat for 1 min, stirring until fully combined

Once boiling, roughly break your gluten free spaghetti in half, add it to the pot and mix it all together

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1604418247064-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Reduce the heat to medium-high, then top with the browned meatballs

Cook for an initial 8-10 min, stirring occasionally to prevent the spaghetti from sticking to the pot, or until the spaghetti is cooked with a slight bite and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the spaghetti is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1604418280758-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the spaghetti is almost done, reduce the heat to medium and top with half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and cook, covered, for a final 2 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your one-pot gluten free tomato spaghetti & meatballs

Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and season generously with black pepper

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot gluten free tomato spaghetti & meatballs with the remaining grated cheese sprinkled on top

Serve the rocket salad to the side and garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Enjoy!
