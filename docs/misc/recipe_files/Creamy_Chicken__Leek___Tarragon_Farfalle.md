### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Pull the chicken skin off the chicken thighs and season the chicken skin generously with salt

### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chicken skin and fry for 4-5 min or until golden and beginning to crisp (it will be finished in the oven)

Tip: Weigh the chicken skin down with a second, smaller pan to make it even crispier

### Step 3

While the chicken skin is cooking, add the chicken thighs to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Once the chicken skin is slightly crispy, add it to the tray with the chicken thighs and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Reserve the pan

### Step 4

Meanwhile, top, tail and slice the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely into rounds, then wash carefully to remove any grit

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Strip the tarragon leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 5

Once hot, add the chopped leek and garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, add the farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once the leek has softened, add the Chinese rice wine and chopped tarragon (reserve a little for garnish) and mix everything together

Crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir through the soft cheese

Add half the grated Italian hard cheese and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1600693274100-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the tray from the oven and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the shredded chicken and drained farfalle to the pan with a splash of reserved starchy pasta water

Season with a crack of black pepper and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy chicken, leek & tarragon farfalle

### Step 8

Roughly chop the crispy chicken skin

Serve the creamy chicken, leek & tarragon farfalle in bowls with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese sprinkled over the top

Garnish with the crispy chicken skin and remaining tarragon leaves

Enjoy!
