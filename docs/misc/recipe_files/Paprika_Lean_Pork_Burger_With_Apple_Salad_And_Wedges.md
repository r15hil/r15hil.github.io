### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray, drizzle them with vegetable oil, then season with half of your smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25 min until crisp – these are your paprika wedges

### Step 2

While the potato wedges are cooking, trim, then finely chop your spring onion[s], separating the whites and greens

Combine your lean pork mince with the remaining smoked paprika and chopped spring onion whites in a bowl and season very generously with salt and pepper

Divide and shape into 1 patty per person and refrigerate until step 6 (this helps them hold their shape whilst cooking) – these are your paprika lean pork patties

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the pan is hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted

Once toasted, set aside until serving and reserve the pan

### Step 4

Peel your red onions, then slice into thin rings

Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the red onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onions have started to caramelise

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar, mayo, remaining sliced spring onion, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your salad dressing

Thinly slice your apple[s] (skin on), then add to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the paprika lean pork patties and cook, covered, for 6-7 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Wash your gem lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and mix it all together – this is your apple salad

### Step 8

To assemble, sandwich the paprika lean pork patties, caramelised onion rings and some apple salad between your toasted brioche halves – these are your paprika lean pork burgers

Serve the paprika wedges and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!
