### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water

Add your sun-dried tomato pesto and tomato paste – this is your pesto stock

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Once the vegetables have started to soften, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your orzo and pesto stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 8-10 min

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to prevent it from sticking!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your king prawns

Once the orzo has had an initial 8-10 min, increase the heat to medium and add the king prawns to the pan, then cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and the orzo is tender

Season with salt and pepper – this is your king prawn, pepper & pesto orzo

Tip: Add a splash more water if your pan's looking a little dry!
