### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, trim, then chop your green beans in half and wash your shredded kale

Cut 1 large piece of tin foil per person and lay the shredded kale and halved green beans in the middle

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and scrunch the edges up to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!), then put the parcel[s] on a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until cooked

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your basa fillet[s] to a plate and drizzle half your soy sauce all over them (save the rest for later!), turning the basa several times until the soy sauce has been absorbed

Sprinkle most of your cornflour (reserve 1/2 tsp per person for later!) all over and rub it into both sides of the basa until fully coated – this is your coated basa

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!

![Step 4 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-4-1658224175401-x200.jpg)

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/chilli-and-garlic-1690538132575-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1658224181166-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Transfer the crispy basa to a clean plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add your hoisin sauce, remaining cornflour and remaining soy sauce with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> water and cook for a further 2 min or until the sauce has thickened and becomes sticky – this is your spicy hoisin sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1658224184577-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the greens are done, remove the parcel[s] from the oven and drain away any excess water

Add them to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil and a pinch of salt, then give them a good mix up – these are your sesame greens

### Step 8

Serve the crispy basa with the cooked rice and sesame greens to the side

Spoon over the spicy hoisin sauce and garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
