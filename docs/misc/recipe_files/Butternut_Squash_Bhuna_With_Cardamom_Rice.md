## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then boil half a kettle

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with half of your garam masala (you'll use the rest later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray into the oven for 18-20 min or until the squash is tender with a slight bite – this is your roasted butternut squash


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Chop your coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 3

Add the peeled ginger, peeled garlic, chopped coriander, red chilli halves (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and half of the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) to a food processor

Add your tomato paste, ground paprika, ground turmeric and remaining garam masala with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and blitz until smooth – this is your bhuna curry paste


### Step 4

Slice your tomatoes into wedges


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the tomato wedges and remaining sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has softened and the tomatoes have started to break down


### Step 6

Meanwhile, crush your cardamom pods with the back of a knife, and add them to a pot with your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice


### Step 7

Once the onion has softened, add the bhuna curry paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[140ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened

### Step 8

Add the roasted butternut squash to the thickened sauce and stir to combine – this is your butternut squash bhuna

Serve the butternut squash bhuna over the cardamom rice, discard the cardamom pods and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
