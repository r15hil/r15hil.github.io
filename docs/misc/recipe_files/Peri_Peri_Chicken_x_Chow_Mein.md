## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 2 medium egg noodle nests
- 1 red chilli
- 320g British skin on chicken thighs
- 15ml soy sauce
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 20g chipotle paste
- 1 carrot
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 8 min or until the skins have slightly crisped


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thick slices

Top, tail and slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely on the diagonal, then slice each carrot disc into matchsticks

Once the skin has slightly crisped, transfer the browned chicken to a baking paper-lined tray (reserve the pan) and sprinkle over half the smoked paprika, the dried oregano, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil


### Step 3

Give everything a good mix up until well coated

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until cooked through and slightly charred (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced onion and carrot matchsticks to the pan with a small splash of cold water

Cook for 10 min or until the onion has softened and the carrot is tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Trim, then chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut half the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Slice the remaining red chilli finely


### Step 5

Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 6

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Combine the tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [175ml]</span> cold water

Add the soy sauce, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and the white wine vinegar – this is your peri-peri sauce


### Step 7

Once the onion is softened, add the chopped garlic and the remaining smoked paprika to the pan with the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the chopped spring onion and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the peri-peri sauce and cook for 3 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the cooked noodles and mix everything together – this is your peri-peri chow mein

### Step 8

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer it to a chopping board and cut into strips – these are your crispy chicken strips

Serve the crispy chicken strips over the peri-peri chow mein

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
