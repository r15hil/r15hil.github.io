## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 15ml cider vinegar
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 5g chives
- 1 x 100g British smoked mackerel fillet
- 1 apple
- 25g honey
- 20g horseradish cream
- 50g lamb's lettuce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] on the diagonal


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes and sliced carrot to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 25 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your apple[s] finely

Chop your chives finely


### Step 4

Combine your natural yoghurt and your horseradish cream in a small bowl with your cider vinegar, honey and most of the chopped chives (reserve some for garnish!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your horseradish dressing


### Step 5

Remove the skin from your smoked mackerel fillet[s] and discard

After the initial 25 min, take the tray[s] out the oven and add the skinned mackerel fillet[s] to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a further 6-7 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp and the mackerel is cooked through (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily)


### Step 6

Wash your lamb's lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the potatoes are golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Transfer the smoked mackerel to a clean chopping board and flake into bite-sized pieces, using two forks


### Step 7

Combine the flaked mackerel and roasted potatoes in a large bowl with the roasted carrot, sliced apple and half the horseradish dressing

Give everything a good mix up – this is your mackerel & potato mix

### Step 8

Serve the lamb's lettuce in bowls and spoon over the mackerel & potato mix

Drizzle over the remaining horseradish dressing and garnish with the reserved chopped chives – this is your Danish-style horseradish mackerel, potato & apple salad

Enjoy!
