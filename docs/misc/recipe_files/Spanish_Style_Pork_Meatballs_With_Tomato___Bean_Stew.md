## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) in a bowl with half the chopped garlic, half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide equally and shape them into 3 meatballs per person


### Step 3

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 125ml <span class="text-purple">[185ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 4

Add the pork meatballs to a baking tray (or two!) (use baking paper to avoid mess!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Whilst the meatballs are cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the remaining chopped garlic with your dried thyme and ground smoked paprika

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and chicken stock to the pot with the drained cannellini beans and a pinch of pepper and sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your tomato & cannellini bean stew


### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Spread a little butter over each toasted ciabatta half

Mix the cooked meatballs through the stew – these are your Spanish-style pork meatballs with tomato & cannellini bean stew

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Keep the meatballs and stew separate!</span>

### Step 8

Serve the Spanish-style pork meatballs with tomato & cannellini bean stew in a bowl and the buttered ciabatta to the side

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley
