## Ingredients

- 185g canned butter beans
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 120g couscous
- 20g harissa paste 
- 30g diced apricots
- 25g pistachio nuts
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine
- 1 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Top and tail the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice, lengthways into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> thin wedges, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with the cherry tomatoes, harissa paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Mix everything together and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender – these are your roasted aubergine wedges & tomatoes


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the diced apricots roughly

Boil a full kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, ras el hanout and cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Just add a little!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock mix to the pan

Drain and rinse the butter beans, then add them to the pan with 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water and cook for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Add the chopped apricots to a bowl and cover them with 80ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water, then set aside to soften


### Step 5

Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, then cover and set aside to soften

Add the pistachio nuts to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, add the roasted aubergine wedges & tomatoes to the pan

Add the soaked apricots with the soaking liquid from the bowl and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, then give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your harissa aubergine & apricot tagine

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


### Step 7

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork and add half the toasted pistachio nuts, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your pistachio couscous

Chop the remaining toasted pistachio nuts roughly

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the harissa aubergine & apricot tagine with the pistachio couscous to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and the chopped toasted pistachio nuts

Enjoy!
