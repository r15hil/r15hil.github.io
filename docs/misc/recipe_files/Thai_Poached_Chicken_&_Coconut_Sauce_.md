### Step 1

Add the basmati rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving&nbsp;

### Step 2

Boil a kettle


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Dissolve half the green curry paste&nbsp;(save the rest for later) in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water


Add the chopped&nbsp;ginger,&nbsp;chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> soy sauce sachets and stir to combine &ndash; this is your poaching liquid

### Step 3

Place the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces


&nbsp;

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a matching lid over a high heat


Add the poaching liquid, chicken and enough boiled water to just cover the chicken


Bring to the boil, cover with a lid&nbsp;and cook for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through


Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks&nbsp;and trim, then finely slice the spring onions

### Step 5

Trim the stems from the pak choi and separate them into leaves


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Combine the softened coconut cream, remaining&nbsp;soy sauce sachets, juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, toasted sesame oil, remaining green curry paste and 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water&nbsp;&ndash; this is your coconut sauce

### Step 6

Once&nbsp;cooked,&nbsp;transfer the chicken to a chopping board and leave the&nbsp;liquid to continue boiling&nbsp;


Use two forks to shred the chicken by pulling the meat in opposite directions


Return&nbsp;the shredded chicken&nbsp;to the pot with the pak choi and cook, covered, for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite

### Step 7

Fluff the&nbsp;rice with a fork and stir through the chopped spring onion and&nbsp;coriander&nbsp;(save a little for garnish!)


Cut the remaining lime into wedges


Drain the shredded chicken and pak choi, discarding the poaching liquid

### Step 8

Serve the shredded chicken over the rice and drizzle the coconut sauce all over


Garnish with a lime wedge and the remaining&nbsp;coriander


Enjoy!
