### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, add your beef mince to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) then equally divide and shape into 1 patty per person

### Step 3

Add the burger patty[ies] to an oiled baking tray with your streaky bacon

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the burger[s] is browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the bacon is crispy

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Chop a large knob of butter into small cubes

Peel your Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

### Step 5

Once the fries are golden, remove them from the oven and push to one side of the tray[s], then top the fries with the cubed butter, garlic and parsley and gently toss everything together – these are your garlic butter fries

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add to the tray[s] (cut side up!)

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min or until the butter has melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 6

Once the burger[s] is cooked through, remove the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven and top each patty with the Italian hard cheese shavings

Return to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy beef patty

Tip: If your bacon is already crispy at this point, add it to a plate and set aside

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1728317732829-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Reserve a<span class="text-danger"> </span>handful of salad for your burger, then toss the remaining salad and the chopped tomato with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and your balsamic vinegar – this is your dressed salad

Add your truffle oil to a small bowl along with your mayo and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together – this is your truffle mayo

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread the warmed brioche base with a dollop of your onion marmalade, then add the cheesy beef patty followed by the crispy bacon, a spoonful of truffle mayo, the reserved salad and top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your bacon cheeseburger

Serve the dressed salad and garlic butter fries to the side with any remaining truffle mayo

Enjoy!
