## Description

The base for this risotto is a pesto made from 3 seed mix, parsley and basil. It forms a soothing fragrant rice dish, accompanied by 'pan con tomate', which is a Spanish tapas side and translates to 'bread with tomato', just in case you were wondering. Italian and Spanish...we think it works, just don't tell either!

## Ingredients

- 3 tomatoes
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine 
- 160g arborio rice 
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 30g 3 seed mix
- 20g basil 
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 40g Italian hard cheese
- 10g parsley 
- 2 ciabatta rolls 
- 3 garlic cloves 
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat&nbsp;(you will use this pan later for your risotto)


Add the 3 seed mix and toast for 1 min or until very slightly browned and starting to pop, then set them&nbsp;aside to cool, keeping the pan for later


### Step 2

Dissolve the vegetable&nbsp;stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml<span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> boiled water


Peel and finely dice the brown&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter


Once the pan is hot and the butter is bubbling, add the onion&nbsp;and cook for 3-5 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 3

Add the arborio&nbsp;rice to the pan and cook for 30 sec, stirring to coat the grains in oil


Add the Shaoxing wine and cook for a further 30 sec or until it has&nbsp;almost evaporated


Add 1/3 of the stock&nbsp;with a pinch of pepper


Once absorbed, continue to add the stock, a little at a time, stirring almost constantly until the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile,&nbsp;peel and finely chop 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> garlic clove<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Roughly chop the basil and parsley together, including the stalks


Add the toasted seeds, basil, parsley, oregano, chopped garlic, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a splash of water and a pinch of salt and pepper to a food processor


Blitz to a coarse paste &ndash; this is your pesto


### Step 5

Slice each ciabatta,&nbsp;as you would a loaf of bread, into 5 even slices


Lay the slices flat on a baking tray then drizzle with&nbsp;olive oil


Put the tray in the oven for&nbsp;4-5 min or until crunchy, you want your bread toasted but not burnt


### Step 6

Slice the tomatoes in half then grate (using the largest grater) directly into a bowl


Peel the remaining 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> garlic cloves and cut them in half&nbsp;


Grate the Italian hard cheese


### Step 7

Remove the toasted ciabatta from the oven then rub the remaining garlic cloves directly onto the toasted surface


Spoon the grated tomato onto the toasted ciabatta then season with salt and pepper&nbsp;&ndash; this is your Pan Con Tomate


Stir the pesto through the risotto, taste and add more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the risotto with the Pan Con Tomate to the side


Garnish with the grated cheese


Enjoy!
