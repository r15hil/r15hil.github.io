### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle and chop the waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and rinse them under cold water until cooled slightly (save the pot for later!)

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat the rump steaks dry with kitchen paper and season both sides with a pinch of salt

Once very hot, add the seasoned steaks to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side

Tip: You'll be returning these to the pan later!

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once the steaks are done, transfer them to a plate to rest

Return the pan to a medium heat, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until starting to caramelise

### Step 4

While the onion and pepper are cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

Trim the fat from the steaks and discard

Slice the rested steaks as finely as you can

### Step 5

Cut the ciabattas in half and spread with a thin layer of butter

Add the buttered halved ciabattas to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 6

Once the onion and peppers have caramelised, add the sliced steaks and soy sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Top with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your Philly cheesesteak filling

### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Combine the mayo, white wine vinegar and a pinch of pepper in the reserved potato pot and give everything a good mix up

Add the cooled potatoes and crush them lightly with a fork

Add most of the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your potato salad

### Step 8

Stuff your warmed ciabattas with the Philly cheesesteak filling and slice in half

Serve with the potato salad to the side and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
