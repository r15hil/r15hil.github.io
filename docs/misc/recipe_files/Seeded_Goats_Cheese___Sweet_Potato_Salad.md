## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Pine kernel & seed mix (30g)
- Red onion x2
- Soft goats' cheese (75g)
- Chopped dates (30g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Sweet potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into quarters, leaving the skins and root on

Tip: This stops them drying out and falling apart when roasting


### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato and onion quarters to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the onion is tender and the sweet potato is cooked and starting to crisp


### Step 3

While the sweet potato and onion is cooking, wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once dry, add it to a large mixing bowl


### Step 4

Add your pine kernel & seed mix to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until the seeds have darkened slightly in colour

Once toasted, remove the tray from the oven and leave to cool

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar with a generous drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Chop your chopped dates up a little more, so they are very finely chopped


### Step 6

Grind a generous amount of pepper onto a chopping board, add the toasted pine kernel & seed mix and the finely chopped dates and chop everything roughly – this is your fruity seed mix

Press your goats' cheese rounds into the fruity seed mix (save any remaining fruity seed mix for the next step!) – these are your seeded goats' cheese rounds

Tip: Apply a good amount of pressure so that the mix sticks to the cheese


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are cooked, carefully cut the roots off the roasted onion quarters and peel off the skins and discard

Separate the roasted onion quarters into petals

Add the roasted onion petals, roasted sweet potato, and remaining fruity seed mix to the salad bowl – this is your sweet potato salad

### Step 8

Break the seeded goats’ cheese rounds into rough pieces and serve over the sweet potato salad

Drizzle the dressing over the top

Enjoy!
