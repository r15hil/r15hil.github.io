- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the wedges are golden and crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your hake fillet[s] in half, widthways

Add the hake pieces to a large bowl with your soy sauce and set aside to marinate


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until coloured and charred on one side only

Once charred, remove and set aside until serving and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Peel and dice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, scoop out the core using a teaspoon, then dice finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred


### Step 5

Add the diced shallot, diced cucumber and shredded lettuce to a bowl

Add your mayo with the juice of half your lemon[s], 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your homemade zingy slaw


### Step 6

Add your cornflour to the bowl with the marinated hake and mix everything together until the fish is evenly coated


### Step 7

Once the wedges are almost ready, return the reserved pan to a high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once very hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

To assemble the burger, top the charred brioche base with a little homemade zingy slaw, the crispy hake and a charred brioche lid – this is your crispy hake burger

Serve the wedges and any remaining homemade zingy slaw to the side

Enjoy!
