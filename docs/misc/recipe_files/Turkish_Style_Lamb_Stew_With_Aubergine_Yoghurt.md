## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk[s] on, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern

Add the aubergine half[ves] to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve half your beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) and your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add your ground cumin to the lamb with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), dried oregano and a grind of pepper, then cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock and reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 min or until thickened and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Turkish-style lamb stew


### Step 4

Once the aubergine has had an initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and press the flesh down firmly with a fork to release the juices (this will help it cook quicker!)

Add the tomato and onion wedges to the tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min further or until the aubergine flesh has softened and everything is tender – these are your roasted vegetables


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve the remaining beef stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a large bowl

Add your couscous to the bowl with the beef stock, stir it all together, then cover with a tea towel and set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed


### Step 6

Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skin, discard the skin

Tip: Carefully hold the stalk (it will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily!

Chop the scooped aubergine flesh finely


### Step 7

Add the chopped aubergine flesh to a bowl with the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt

Stir it all together – this is your aubergine yoghurt

Fluff the couscous with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine yoghurt over the fluffed couscous, then top with the Turkish-style lamb stew and roasted vegetables

Garnish with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
