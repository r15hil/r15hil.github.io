## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 2

Add the sliced onion and pepper strips to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until the vegetables are soft and golden – this is your roasted onion & pepper


### Step 3

While the vegetables are cooking, remove and discard the skin from your salmon fillet[s], then cut into 6 pieces per person

Add the salmon pieces to a bowl, drizzle with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up until they're coated


### Step 4

Add your cornflour, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground cumin with a pinch of salt to a plate and stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Add the coated salmon pieces to the plate and gently turn them until they're fully coated in the spice mix – these are your spiced salmon pieces


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced salmon pieces and cook, turning frequently for 6-8 min or until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy salmon pieces

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the salmon pieces are cooking, add your tortillas to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 7

Chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)

Combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar, chopped coriander and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your coriander mayo

Wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then shred it roughly

### Step 8

To assemble your Baja-style tacos, divide the shredded lettuce and roasted onion & pepper between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with 2 crispy salmon pieces and drizzle with the coriander mayo

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
