Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato base

### Step 3

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, tear your ciabatta[s] roughly into bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Once the potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the baking tray from the oven and carefully cut the potatoes in half, then press down hard with a spatula to flatten them – these are your baked potatoes

Fluff the insides with a fork and add a little butter with a large pinch of salt

### Step 6

Divide the tomato base equally between the baked potatoes, then top with the torn mozzarella and sliced pepperoni

Add the croutons to the other side of the baking tray and return the tray to the oven for 5-6 min or until the croutons are golden and the cheese has melted – these are your pepperoni pizza baked potatoes

Tip: Cooking for 3? Use 2 trays!

### Step 7

Whilst everything is in the oven, chop your chives finely, then wash your lettuce and salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove 3 leaves per person from the lettuce and shred the inner core

Add the lettuce leaves and shredded lettuce to the dressing with the salad and the chopped chives

Once ready, add the toasted croutons to the salad and toss together until everything is coated in the dressing – this is your cheat's Caesar salad

### Step 8

Serve the pepperoni pizza baked potatoes with the cheat's Caesar salad to the side

Sprinkle the remaining oregano over the baked potatoes and top the salad with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
