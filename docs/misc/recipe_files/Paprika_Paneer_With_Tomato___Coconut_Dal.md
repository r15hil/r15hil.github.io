## Ingredients

- 2 mini garlic & coriander naans
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 200g paneer cheese
- 50g solid creamed coconut
- 2 tsp ground paprika
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 5g coriander
- 125g baby plum tomatoes
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 2 garlic cloves
- 100g red lentils
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tip: This is just to warm your naans (alternatively, just pop them in the toaster)

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and a large pinch of sugar in 750ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the onion has softened, add the ground turmeric, curry powder and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, rinse the red lentils, then add them to the pan with the coconut stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are almost cooked and the sauce has thickened


### Step 5

While the lentils are cooking, chop the paneer into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped paneer to bowl, then coat with the ground paprika, nigella seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop the baby plum tomatoes in half


### Step 6

Add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for 5-7 min further or until the tomatoes have softened and the lentils are fully cooked

Stir most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) through the lentils – this is your tomato & coconut dal


### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated paneer and cook for 4-5 min

Add the cider vinegar and cook for further 1-2 min or until the paneer is golden – this is your paprika paneer

Meanwhile, add the mini garlic & coriander naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the paprika paneer over the tomato & coconut dal with the warmed mini garlic & coriander naans to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
