### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut 1 piece of tin foil per person approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

### Step 4

Add the carrot ribbons, sliced spring greens, chopped garlic and ginger paste to the middle of the foil with half your toasted sesame oil (save the rest for later!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>water and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the veg to form 1 sealed parcel per person and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until the spring greens have wilted – this is your sesame veg

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, remaining toasted sesame oil and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl – this is your chilli soy dressing

### Step 6

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper, then add them to a bowl with your cornflour

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Give everything a good mix up until the haddock is fully coated – this is your coated haddock

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1632475656978-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated haddock and cook for 3 min, turning halfway, or until golden, crispy and cooked through – these are your crispy haddock bites

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the crispy haddock bites and sesame veg over the brown rice

Pour the chilli soy dressing all over and garnish with the black sesame seeds and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
