- 210g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 1 carrot
- 10g basil
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Top, tail, peel and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until the onion has softened slightly but not coloured


### Step 3

Add the diced pepper and carrot to the pan and cook for 8 min or until softened

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further – this is your veggie mix


### Step 4

While the veggie mix is cooking, dissolve vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Drain and rinse the green lentils


### Step 5

Add the vegetable stock, tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, drained lentils, Henderson's Relish and a pinch of salt and pepper to the veggie mix

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until slightly thickened and the carrots are cooked – this is your veggie bolognese


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the wholewheat spaghetti and return to the pot until serving


### Step 7

While the spaghetti is cooking, chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Stir half of the chopped basil into the veggie bolognese (save the rest for garnish!)

### Step 8

Serve the veggie bolognese over the wholewheat spaghetti

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Enjoy!
