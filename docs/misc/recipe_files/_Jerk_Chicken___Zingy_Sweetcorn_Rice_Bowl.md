### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Peel and cut your brown onions[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken strips and onion petals to the pan with your jerk paste and a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your jerk chicken strips

### Step 3

Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 4

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Drain your sweetcorn

### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 6

Add the drained sweetcorn to a bowl with the chopped tomato, sliced spring onion, lime zest and juice from half your lime[s]

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your zingy sweetcorn salsa

### Step 7

Combine your mayo with a small squeeze of lime juice and a pinch of pepper – this is your lime mayo

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the cooked rice and top with the jerk chicken strips and zingy sweetcorn salsa

Top with the lime mayo and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
