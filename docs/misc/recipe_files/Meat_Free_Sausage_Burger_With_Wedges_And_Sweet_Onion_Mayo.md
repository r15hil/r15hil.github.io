## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Meat-free sausages (6pcs)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x4
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp and browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine the onion marmalade, Dijon mustard, mayo and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl with a pinch of pepper – this is your sweet onion mayo

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves, cut-side down, to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until nicely browned

Once browned, transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan for later


### Step 4

Meanwhile, remove the meat-free sausage meat from the casings and add it to a bowl, discard the casings

Using clean hands, break it apart and give it a good mix up until fully combined

Divide the meat-free sausage meat into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and shape into patties


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meat-free sausage patties, cover with a lid and cook for 4-6 min, turning midway through until the patties are browned

Tip: Press the patties down with a spatula to keep them nice and flat throughout cooking


### Step 6

Combine the red wine vinegar, dried oregano, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl with a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper – this is your vinaigrette


### Step 7

Wash the lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves into bite-sized pieces, then add them to the bowl with the vinaigrette and give everything a good mix up – this is your lettuce salad

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, top each toasted brioche base with 2 meat-free sausage patties, a spoonful of sweet onion mayo and finish with the toasted brioche lid

Serve the lettuce salad and wedges to the side

Enjoy!
