## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until charred and tender

Once done, transfer to a bowl and set aside, reserve the pan


### Step 4

Add the chopped parsley, chopped tomato and your red wine vinegar to the bowl with the charred pepper

Add a little drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your charred pepper & parsley salsa


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a high heat and once hot, add your lean beef mince with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander and a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Once browned, add the onion petals and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the tomato stock to the pan with a pinch of sugar

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has reduced and the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lean beef taco mix

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Divide the lean beef taco mix equally between each warmed tortilla and top with the charred pepper & parsley salsa

Enjoy!
