### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deeseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Cut your lime[s] into quarters

Strip a few coriander leaves from their stalks and save for garnish

Chop the remaining coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 3

Combine half your ginger paste (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of half your lime quarters in a large bowl

Add half your chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and stir it all together

Add your carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw and chopped coriander (reserve the leaves for garnish) to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ginger salad

### Step 4

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [8 tbsp] </span>flour to a large bowl with your ground paprika, ground turmeric and a very generous pinch of salt

Mix until fully combined

### Step 5

Add your chicken thighs to the bowl with 4 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [6 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[8 tsp]</span> cold water

Give everything a good mix up and, using your hands, scrunch the flour onto the chicken so that it is well coated – this is your coated chicken

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-39-1716191601042-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coated chicken to the pan and cook for 9-10 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Burmese-style fried chicken

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-39-1716191605926-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

In a separate bowl, combine your tamarind paste and soy sauce with your remaining ginger paste, the chopped garlic and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water and a small squeeze of lime juice and mix it all together – this is your achin yay dipping sauce

Add your crispy onions to the ginger salad and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Serve the Burmese-style fried chicken with the basmati rice, ginger salad, achin yay dipping sauce and remaining lime quarter[s] to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top the ginger salad with the reserved coriander leaves and garnish the rice with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!
