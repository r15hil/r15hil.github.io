## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 20g chipotle paste
- 200g basa fillets
- 4 white potatoes
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 5g coriander
- 4 skewers
- 1 pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

Soak the skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking!)

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips, sliced onion and a pinch of salt, then cook for 2 min to soften slightly

Once softened, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 min or until caramelised


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the basa fillets into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> strips, lengthways

Place the basa strips in a large mixing bowl with the smoked paprika and a pinch of salt, then mix well to ensure the strips are coated

Thread each coated basa strip onto a soaked skewer in a snake-like fashion and set aside


### Step 5

Once done, transfer the caramelised pepper & onion to a bowl (reserve the pan for later!)

Add half of the red wine vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) to the bowl with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir through the chopped coriander – this is your pepper & onion salsa


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa skewers and cook for 3 min, turning once halfway, until browned on both sides

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, cover with a lid and cook for a further 2 min or until cooked through – these are your smoky basa skewers

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Whilst the basa is cooking, combine the mayo with the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl – this is your spicy mayo

### Step 8

Serve the smoky basa skewers with the crispy potatoes, pepper & onion salsa and spicy mayo to the side

Enjoy!
