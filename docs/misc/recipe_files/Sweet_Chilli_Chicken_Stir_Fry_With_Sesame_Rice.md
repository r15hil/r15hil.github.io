## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice and 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan or wok (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 4

Once hot, add the chicken strips with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over


### Step 5

Once browned, add the sliced garlic, chopped pepper and mangetout and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> cold water in a small bowl

Add your chilli relish, soy sauce and cornflour mix to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet chilli chicken stir-fry


### Step 7

Once done, stir your black sesame seeds through the cooked rice – this is your sesame rice

### Step 8

Serve the sweet chilli chicken stir-fry over the sesame rice

Enjoy!
