## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 0 white long grain rice
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 60g THIS meat-free bacon lardons
- 15ml soy sauce
- 160g blanched peas
- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 0 soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your chestnut mushrooms finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free bacon lardons and sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until the meat-free bacon is golden and crispy all over


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 5

Trim then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds


### Step 6

Once the meat-free bacon has started to crisp, add the chopped ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked rice with your soy sauce and your toasted sesame oil and give everything a good mix up until all the rice is coated


### Step 7

Once the rice is coated, add your blanched peas and half of the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest for garnish!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your smoky meat-free bacon fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the smoky meat-free bacon fried rice in bowls

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
