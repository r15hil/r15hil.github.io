## Ingredients

- 2 dried lime leaves
- 8ml fish sauce
- 0 cornflour
- 1 tbsp cornflour 
- 0 red Thai curry paste
- 40g red Thai curry paste
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 10g coriander
- 1 leek
- 0 coriander
- 1 pepper
- 1 shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, boil a full kettle, then peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with the chopped potato and red Thai curry paste and cook for 6 min or until the chicken is lightly coloured


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves and top, tail and slice finely

Top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, then slice finely

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Once the chicken is lightly coloured, add your cornflour to the pot with the chopped shallot, sliced leek, sliced carrot and pepper strips

Stir everything together and cook for 1-2 min or until the shallot has slightly softened


### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chopped creamed coconut in 700ml <span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger">[910ml]</span> [1.2 L]</span> boiled water with your lime leaf[ves] and fish sauce – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Once the shallot has slightly softened, add the coconut stock to the pot with a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, lower the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender – this is your Thai-style spiced chicken thigh, leek & potato soup


### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)


### Step 7

Once the soup is ready, remove the lime leaf[ves] and stir through the chopped coriander

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style spiced chicken thigh, leek & potato soup in bowls

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
