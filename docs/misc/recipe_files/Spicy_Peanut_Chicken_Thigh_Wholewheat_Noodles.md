## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly and trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once the pan is hot, add your diced chicken thigh and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 7-9 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

While the chicken cooks, add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Once done, drain the soaked noodles and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 4

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the halved green beans and cook for a further 3 min or until starting to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your peanut butter, sriracha, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey, rice vinegar and soy sauce to a bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy peanut sauce


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, add the spicy peanut sauce and drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy peanut chicken thigh wholewheat noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 7

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

### Step 8

Serve the spicy peanut chicken thigh wholewheat noodles

Garnish with the crushed peanuts and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
