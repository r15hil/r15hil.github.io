## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the lardons are cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Top, tail and dice your carrot[s] finely (no need to peel!)

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Once the lardons are golden, add a knob of butter to the pan with the sliced onion, sliced garlic, diced carrot and dried thyme

Season with a crack of black pepper and cook for 5-6 min or until the onion has softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Dissolve your beef stock mix, tomato paste and Henderson's Relish in 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 6

Add the drained cannellini beans to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up

Add the stock with a pinch of sugar and stir it all together

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your bacon & hearty bean filling


### Step 7

Transfer the bacon & hearty bean filling to an oven-proof dish and carefully top with the sliced potato (they will be hot!)

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your bacon & bean casserole

### Step 8

Serve the bacon & bean casserole

Enjoy!
