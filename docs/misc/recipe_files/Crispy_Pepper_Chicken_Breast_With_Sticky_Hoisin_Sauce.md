### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layer[s] of the lemongrass and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core[s] finely

### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice, 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and the outer lemongrass layer[s] to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your lemongrass rice

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, pat your diced chicken breast dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with your cornflour and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!), then toss to coat them evenly – this is your pepper chicken

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the pepper chicken and cook for 10-12 min or until crispy and golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Transfer the cooked chicken to kitchen paper, season with salt and set aside until serving – this is your crispy pepper chicken

Wipe the pan clean and reserve it for later

Add your mangetout and cook for a further 2-3 min

### Step 7

Combine your hoisin sauce, rice vinegar and honey in a bowl – this is your hoisin mixture

Add the hoisin mixture to the reserved pan over a medium heat

Cook for 1-2 min or until sticky – this is your sticky hoisin sauce

### Step 8

Serve the crispy pepper chicken with the mangetout and lemongrass rice to the side

Drizzle the sticky hoisin sauce over and sprinkle with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
