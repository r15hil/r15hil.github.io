## Ingredients

- Smoked streaky bacon (90g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (45g) x0
- Linguine (100g) x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Basil (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Rocket (20g)
- Asparagus spears (120g)
- Linguine (190g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Add your smoked streaky bacon to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim the woody ends off your asparagus, then chop them in half

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!


### Step 3

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for an initial 7 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 5

Once the pasta has been cooking for 7 min, add the halved asparagus and sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until just tender

Once tender, drain and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Return the pot to a medium heat, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter and a generous drizzle of olive oil, then give everything a good mix up until the butter has melted

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and add half the chopped basil with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add a splash of the starchy pasta water and stir it all together


### Step 7

Remove the crispy bacon from the oven and chop it roughly with a sharp knife

Add the chopped bacon to the pot, give everything another good mix and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your crispy bacon & lemony asparagus linguine

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the crispy bacon & lemony asparagus linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and chopped basil

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
