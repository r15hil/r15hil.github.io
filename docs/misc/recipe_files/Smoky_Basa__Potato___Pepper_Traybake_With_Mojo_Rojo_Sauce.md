## Ingredients

- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Basa fillet x0
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Yellow pepper
- Red pepper
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop (keep the colours separate!)

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin


### Step 2

Add the chopped potato and chopped yellow pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with the onion wedges, half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min – these are your roasted veggies


### Step 3

While the vegetables are roasting, add the chopped red pepper to a separate, tin foil-lined baking tray, then scrunch the sides up to create a parcel

Add the peeled garlic, ground cumin, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the parcel and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the pepper is softened and golden – this is your roasted pepper mix


### Step 4

Meanwhile, trim your green beans

Cut the trimmed green beans in half


### Step 5

Pat the basa fillet[s] dry with the kitchen paper, then evenly sprinkle the remaining ground smoked paprika over the fish – this is your smoky basa


### Step 6

After an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] with the roasted veggies from the oven and add the chopped green beans and smoky basa with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your smoky basa, potato & pepper traybake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Transfer the roasted pepper mix to a food processor with your red wine vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and your vegetable stock mix and blitz until smooth – this is your mojo rojo sauce

### Step 8

Serve the smoky basa, potato & pepper traybake

Drizzle over the mojo rojo sauce and mayo

Enjoy!
