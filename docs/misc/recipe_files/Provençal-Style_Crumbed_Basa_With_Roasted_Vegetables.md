### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until beginning to turn golden

### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and dice your courgette[s]

Add the diced courgette to a bowl with your dried oregano, a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 3

Once the potatoes have had 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved tomatoes

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10 min

### Step 4

While the vegetables are in the oven, grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the grated cheese and panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

### Step 5

After 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the diced courgette

Top the courgette with your basa fillet[s] and press the cheesy breadcrumbs onto the fish

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min further or until the breadcrumbs are crisp and golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Provençal-style crumbed basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Stir it all together – this is your garlic & parsley oil

### Step 8

Drizzle the garlic & parsley oil all over

Enjoy!
