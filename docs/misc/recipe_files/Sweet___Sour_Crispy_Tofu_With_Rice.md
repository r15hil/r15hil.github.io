### Step 1

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into small bite-sized cubes and add them to a bowl with the small soy sauce sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (save the larger sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> for later!)

Drain the pineapple and pour in the pineapple juice

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate

### Step 2

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 3

Drain the marinated tofu

Add most of the cornflour (save 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> for later) to the marinated tofu and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy all over, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and reserve the pan – this is your crispy tofu

### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking, deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then slice the spring onions into batons

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once the pepper has started to soften, add the spring onion batons, chopped ginger and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Add the large soy sauce sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, tomato ketchup, chilli relish, rice vinegar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your sweet & sour sauce
