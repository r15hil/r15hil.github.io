## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> soft butter to a bowl with your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your ras el hanout (you'll use the rest later!) and mix with a fork – this is your butter mix

Tip: If your butter is not soft then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!


### Step 2

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic to the butter mix with half the chopped coriander, half the chopped mint (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix – this is your spiced butter

Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of the chicken breast portions (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Fill the pockets with as much of the spiced butter as you can, reserving any leftover for the potatoes


### Step 4

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the remaining ras el hanout and mix together


### Step 5

Coat the stuffed chicken breast portions in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg and finally press into the seasoned breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Transfer the breaded chicken, butter-side up, to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) and drizzle over a little olive oil

Put the tray[s] in oven for 22-25 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa & garlic butter stuffed chicken


### Step 6

Peel and chop your potato[es] and sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes and sweet potato to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once done, drain and return them to the pot

Add the remaining spiced butter to the cooked potatoes with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth


### Step 7

Meanwhile, peel your courgette[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Add the courgette ribbons to a bowl with your chopped dates and your white wine vinegar

Add a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining chopped coriander and mint and give everything a good mix up – this is your courgette & date salad

### Step 8

Serve the harissa & garlic butter stuffed chicken with the mashed potato and courgette & date salad to the side

Enjoy!
