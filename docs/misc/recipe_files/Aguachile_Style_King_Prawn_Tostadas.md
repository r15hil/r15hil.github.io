Inspired by the northwestern Mexican classic, aguachile is a zesty, summer dish similar to ceviche. For your version, you’ll pan-fry king prawns with coriander, chilli and lime before building your crispy tostadas with roasted potato and red onion.

## Ingredients

- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 1 green chilli
- 6 plain tortillas
- 2 white potatoes
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dice the potatoes (skins on) finely

Peel and chop 3/4 of the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Slice the remaining onion finely


### Step 2

Add the diced potatoes and onion wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, roughly chop the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely


### Step 4

Add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), crushed garlic and coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and the juice of 1<span class="text-danger"> [2]</span> lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Blitz until well combined – this is your aguachile-style dressing


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your tostadas

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain then add the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through


### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, add the aguachile-style dressing to a large bowl with the sliced onion and sliced cucumber

Once cooked, add the king prawns to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – these are your aguachile-style king prawns

### Step 8

To serve, add the roasted potatoes & onion to the tostadas and top with the aguachile-style king prawns

Enjoy!
