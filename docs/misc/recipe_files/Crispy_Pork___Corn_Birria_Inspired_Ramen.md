### Step 1

Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up into very small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

Cook for 4-5 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and crispy – this is your crispy pork
