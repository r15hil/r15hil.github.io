### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 7-8 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go
