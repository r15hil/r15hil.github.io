### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, drain and rinse your sweetcorn

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters

Peel, finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, drain your jumbo king prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half the lime[s] with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mayo and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your chipotle-lime mayo

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Once the prawns are almost cooked, add the chopped garlic, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and dried oregano and cook for 1 min

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat, then add the sliced spring onion, chopped cherry tomatoes and shredded lettuce and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy Mexican-style jumbo prawn rice

Serve the spicy Mexican-style jumbo prawn rice with a lime wedge and lettuce leaves to the side

Drizzle the chipotle-lime mayo all over

Enjoy!
