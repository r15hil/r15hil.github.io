## Ingredients

- 0 British pork loin steak
- 150g canned sweetcorn
- 0 chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 0 tomato paste
- 0 white long grain rice
- 1 tomato
- 2 x 150g British pork loin steaks
- 32g tomato paste
- 130g white long grain rice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1 green chilli
- 1 cider vinegar
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Slice your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Add the sliced shallot and sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a large bowl with your cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and a little drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot & chilli


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 4

Season both sides of your pork loin steak[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and a sprinkling of flour


### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, transfer the cooked pork to a plate to rest and reserve the pan


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil to a medium-high heat

Add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika to the pan with your ground cumin, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir it all together

Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and chicken stock mix and and cook for a further 2-3 min or until thickened - this is your Tex-Mex style spiced tomato sauce


### Step 7

Add the chopped tomato and drained sweetcorn to the quick-pickled shallot & chilli and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy corn salsa

### Step 8

Slice the rested pork on a clean chopping board and serve on top of the cooked rice, then pour the Tex-Mex style spiced tomato sauce on top

Serve with the spicy corn salsa to the side

Enjoy!
