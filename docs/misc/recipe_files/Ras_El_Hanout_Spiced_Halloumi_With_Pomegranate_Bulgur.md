## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 2 tomatoes
- 200g halloumi
- 15g pomegranate molasses
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 10g coriander & mint 
- 1 tsp ground sumac
- 1 pepper
- 30g sultanas 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop the tomatoes into wedges and deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough chunks

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the tomato wedges and chopped pepper on a baking tray, then place it in the oven for 20-25 min or until soft


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine the sultanas in a small bowl with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water and set aside to soak

Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the halloumi into thick slices


### Step 4

Combine half the ras el hanout (save the rest for later!) in a bowl with the ground sumac and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your spice mix

Add the sliced halloumi and give it a good mix up to coat evenly– this is your spiced halloumi


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion and cook for 6-7 min or until soft and lightly caramelised – these are your caramelised onions


### Step 6

Drain the sultanas and add them to the cooked bulgur

Add the pomegranate molasses, roasted veg, caramelised onions (reserve the pan!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the remaining ras el hanout and give everything a good mix up – this is your pomegranate bulgur

Combine the chopped mint and chopped coriander in a small bowl with the natural yoghurt – this is your herby yoghurt


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced halloumi and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden – this is your ras el hanout spiced halloumi

### Step 8

Serve the ras el hanout spiced halloumi over the pomegranate bulgur

Dollop over the herby yoghurt

Enjoy!
