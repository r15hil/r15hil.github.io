### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Add the beef mince and Marmite to a bowl with a generous grind of black pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a very good mix up until fully combined

Divide the beef mixture into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> and roll into meatballs

### Step 2

Cut the cheddar into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> pieces

Press a piece of cheddar into the middle of each meatball and seal it in with the beef (make sure there are no gaps) – these are your cheese-stuffed Marmite meatballs

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, until browned

Once browned, transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside (you'll finish cooking them later!)

### Step 4

While the meatballs are cooking, peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic finely

Once the meatballs are done, return the pan to a medium-high heat with any remaining oil

Once hot, add the chopped red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 10-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water and drizzle with a little olive oil

Tip: The olive oil stops the pasta from sticking together!

### Step 6

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, beef stock, a pinch of sugar and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min further until the sauce has started to thicken

### Step 7

Once thickened, add the browned meatballs and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until cooked through

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the wholewheat spaghetti in bowls and top with the tomato sauce and cheese-stuffed Marmite meatballs

Tear over the basil leaves

Enjoy!
