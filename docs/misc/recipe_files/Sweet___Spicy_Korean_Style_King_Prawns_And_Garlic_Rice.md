### Step 2

Add a small drizzle of vegetable oil to a pot with a lid over a medium heat

### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice to the pot with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your garlic rice

Give everything a good mix up, then add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [85ml] </span>warm water and stir it all together until smooth – this is your gochujang stock

### Step 6

Once the rice is almost cooked, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through
