## Ingredients

- 0 mayonnaise
- 16g tomato paste
- 1 tomato
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 0 ground coriander
- 160g meat-free chick'n
- 0 ground smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes

Add the potato cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Peel and roughly slice your red onion[s]

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the veg is soft and tender – this is your roasted veg


### Step 3

While the veg is in the oven, boil half a kettle

Dice your tomato[es]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy tomato stock


### Step 4

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced tomato with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes have broken down

Add the spicy tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened – this is your bravas sauce


### Step 5

While the sauce thickens, combine your ground coriander, ground smoked paprika, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your smoky spice mix

Add your meat-free chick'n to the smoky spice mix and mix together until they are fully coated, then tap off any excess spices  – this is your coated meat-free chick'n


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min or until browned and cooked through – this is your smoky Spanish-style meat-free chick'n


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your mayo, chopped garlic (not a big fan of raw garlic? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your aioli

### Step 8

Serve the smoky Spanish-style meat-free chick'n with the crispy potatoes and roasted veg to the side

Top the crispy potatoes with the bravas sauce – this is your patatas bravas

Drizzle the aioli all over the patatas bravas

Enjoy!
