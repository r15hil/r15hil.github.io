## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your venison & pork burger[s] and break it up with a wooden spoon, then cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is large enough to cover the oven proof dish[es]


### Step 4

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Add the chopped onion to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and your dried thyme

Give everything a good mix up and add 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[375ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste, beef stock mix, soy sauce, bay leaf[ves] and red wine paste

Bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your pie mix


### Step 5

Transfer the pie mix to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Top the pie mix with the rolled pastry and crimp round the edge with a fork

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 20-22 min or until puffed up and golden and the meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your venison, pork & red wine pie


### Step 6

Top, tail and chop your parsnips into quarters lengthways, then into batons

Add the parsnip batons to a baking tray with a pinch of sugar, a knob of butter and a grind of pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-22 min or until tender – these are your caramelised parsnips


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the venison, pork & red wine pie with the caramelised parsnips to the side

Dig in!
