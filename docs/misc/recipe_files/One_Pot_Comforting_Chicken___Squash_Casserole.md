### Step 6

Once the potatoes are nearly done, cut your ciabatta[s] in half and add them to a baking tray

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the chicken & squash casserole in bowls with the warmed ciabatta to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and the reserved thyme leaves

Enjoy!
