## Ingredients

- 25g roasted peanuts
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 dried lime leaves
- 50g solid creamed coconut
- 15ml fish sauce
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk
- 80g untrimmed fine green beans
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin, slice down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Add the white long grain rice and 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat 

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your lemongrass rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips, chopped garlic, ground turmeric, chopped ginger and chopped lemongrass and cook for 2-3 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the basa fillets into pieces

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and add the lime leaves, fish sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Trim, then cut the green beans in half

Add the coconut stock, halved green beans and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for an initial 3 min


### Step 6

After 3 min, add the basa pieces to the pan

Cook for a further 6 min or until the basa is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your mild Cambodian-style basa samla curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the peanuts roughly (or bash them in a bag with the rolling pin!)

Remove the lemongrass outer layers from the rice and discard

### Step 8

Serve the mild Cambodian-style basa samla curry with the lemongrass rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with the chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
