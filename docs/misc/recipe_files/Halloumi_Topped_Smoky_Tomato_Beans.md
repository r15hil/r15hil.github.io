## Ingredients

- 1 gem lettuce
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 390g cannellini beans
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 200g halloumi
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 80g spinach
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, separating the onion into petals


### Step 3

While the onion petals are softening, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced garlic to the pan with the smoked paprika and drained cannellini beans and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has softened

Preheat the grill to high


### Step 5

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan with the chopped tomatoes and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach is bright green and wilted and the sauce has slightly thickened – these are your smoky tomato beans


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate the halloumi

Transfer the smoky tomato beans to an oven-proof dish

Top with the grated halloumi then sprinkle the dried oregano over the top

Put the dish under the grill for 5 min or until the halloumi has begun to melt and crisp up – these are your halloumi-topped smoky tomato beans


### Step 7

While the dish is under the grill, wash the gem lettuce and pat dry, then cut into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges

### Step 8

Serve the halloumi-topped smoky tomato beans on a plate with the lettuce wedges to the side

Drizzle the balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil over the lettuce wedges and finish with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
