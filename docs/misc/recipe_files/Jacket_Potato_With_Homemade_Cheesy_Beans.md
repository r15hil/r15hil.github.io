### Step 4

Add the softened red potato[es] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-16 min or until crispy on the outside

While the potato is in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, add the trimmed green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a very small knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite

### Step 7

Once the potato has had an initial 15-16 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully slice in half down the middle (careful, it will be hot!)

Spoon the homemade cheesy beans over your baked potato[es] and top with the torn mozzarella

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 7-8 min or until melted and oozy – this is your jacket potato with homemade cheesy beans

### Step 8

Serve the jacket potato with homemade cheesy beans with the green beans to the side

Sprinkle the Italian hard cheese shavings over the beans and season with a generous grind of black pepper
