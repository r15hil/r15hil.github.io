## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Peel your carrot[s], and continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the carrot ribbons and sliced radishes to a bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled veg


### Step 5

Add your white miso paste, honey, ginger & garlic paste and mirin to a bowl with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>boiled water and stir it all together – this is your miso glaze


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs to the pan and cook for 7-8 min on each side or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through add the miso glaze and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened slightly – these are your miso-glazed chicken thighs


### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Drain the quick-pickled veg

### Step 8

Serve the miso-glazed chicken thighs with the sticky rice and quick-pickled veg to the side

Spoon any remaining miso glaze over the chicken

Garnish with your black sesame seeds and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
