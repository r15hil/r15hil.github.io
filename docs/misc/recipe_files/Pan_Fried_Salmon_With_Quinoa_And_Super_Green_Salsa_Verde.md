## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 20g parsley
- 2 x 110g skin on salmon fillets
- 30g capers
- 160g blanched peas
- 10.5g wholegrain mustard
- 130g quinoa
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 50g rocket

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the quinoa is almost cooked


### Step 2

While the quinoa is cooking, chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks


### Step 3

Add the chopped parsley, capers, red wine vinegar, half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the wholegrain mustard, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt to a food processor

Blitz into a smooth, thick paste – this is your super green salsa verde

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining wholegrain mustard for another recipe!


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Once hot, add the salmon fillets, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Trim and chop the green beans in half

Once the quinoa has had 15 min, add the halved green beans to the pot and cook for 3-4 min or until tender


### Step 6

Once tender, add the blanched peas

Cook for 1 min then drain and return everything to the pot


### Step 7

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to the quinoa & vegetables and season with a pinch of salt

Give it a gentle mix up – this is your greens & quinoa mix

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried salmon over the greens & quinoa mix

Dollop the super green salsa verde all over

Enjoy!
