## Ingredients

- British chicken breast portion x0
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x2
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Sweet potato
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and grate your garlic

Add the grated garlic to a bowl with your soft cheese, half of your dried oregano (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of black pepper – this is your garlic & herb mix


### Step 2

Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of your chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Stuff the chicken pocket[s] with the garlic & herb mix


### Step 3

Add the stuffed chicken to a small oven-proof dish and scatter over your cherry tomatoes

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use two dishes!


### Step 4

Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the remaining dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the dish to the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the tomatoes and garlic & herb mixture have created a sauce in the bottom of the dish – this is your garlic & herb stuffed chicken


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, peel your potato[es] and sweet potato[es], then cut them into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 6

Trim, then add your green beans to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the chicken has 10 min left, add the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 8-10 min until the beans have softened and started to brown – these are your roasted green beans


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a knob of butter

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash

### Step 8

Serve the garlic & herb stuffed chicken over the sweet potato mash with the roasted green beans to the side

Spoon over the cherry tomatoes & sauce

Enjoy!
