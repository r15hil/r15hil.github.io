### Step 2

Boil a full kettle

Add the red onion wedges and butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with 2/3 of your ras el hanout (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender

### Step 3

Whilst the vegetables are cooking, add your giant couscous to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until the giant couscous is tender

Once cooked, drain the couscous, reserving the pot for later

### Step 4

Cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate then slice into quarters, then place the pomegranate quarters into a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and set them aside for garnish

### Step 6

Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your natural yoghurt in a separate bowl – this is your harissa yoghurt

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Wash your lettuce, and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then roughly shred and toss in the dressing

### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the remaining ras el hanout and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pot from the heat, then add the drained couscous and roasted vegetables and stir it all together – this is your tagine-style squash with giant couscous

### Step 8

Serve the shredded lettuce in a wide bowl topped with the tagine-style squash with giant couscous – this is your tagine-style salad with giant couscous

Dollop over the harissa yoghurt and garnish with the chopped mint, pomegranate seeds and flaked almonds

Enjoy!
