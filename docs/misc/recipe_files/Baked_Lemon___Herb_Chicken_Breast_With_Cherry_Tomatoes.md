## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add them to a large oven-proof dish


### Step 3

Crush your garlic cloves by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Pat your chicken breast portion[s] dry with kitchen paper and season them with a generous pinch of salt


### Step 4

Add your seasoned chicken and crushed garlic to the dish with your cherry tomatoes, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, leaving the chicken at the top and put the dish in the oven for an initial 10-15 min


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your dried basil and dried oregano – this is your herby stock

Slice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] into slices and set them aside for later

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

After an initial 10-15 min, remove the dish from the oven and pour the herby stock all over the potatoes and tomatoes

Squeeze over the remaining lemon and top the chicken with the reserved lemon slices


### Step 7

Return the dish to the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baked lemon & herb chicken with cherry tomatoes

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

### Step 8

To serve, add a few knobs of butter to the potatoes and leave to melt

Tear your parsley and dill all over the baked lemon & herb chicken with cherry tomatoes

Drizzle the shredded lettuce with some olive oil and serve it alongside

Dig in!
