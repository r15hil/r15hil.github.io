## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 16g tomato paste
- 80g soured cream
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 250g British diced chicken breast
- 200g conchiglie
- 0 conchiglie
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot, chopped pepper and diced chicken breast and cook for an initial 5-6 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 6-8 min

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once done, drain the conchiglie, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix with your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]  </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

After an initial 5-6 min, add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika to the pan with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and soured cream and give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky sauce


### Step 6

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Add the cooked conchiglie and a splash of starchy pasta water to the smoky sauce and stir it all together until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce

Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish and top with the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your smoky chicken & pepper pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve your smoky chicken & pepper pasta bake and season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
