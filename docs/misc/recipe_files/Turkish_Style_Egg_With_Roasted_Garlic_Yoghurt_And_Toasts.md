## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add a knob of butter and your ground smoked paprika to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until the butter is melted and fragrant – this is your smoky butter


### Step 3

Once fragrant, transfer the smoky butter to a bowl, reserving the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Add your cherry tomatoes and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes start to blister – these are your blistered tomatoes


### Step 4

Bring a pot with plenty of boiled water, half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Crack your egg[s] gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the egg[s] with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your poached egg


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the sliced ciabatta to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through – these are your toasts

Combine your natural yoghurt and your roasted garlic paste in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted garlic yoghurt


### Step 6

Slice your cucumber[s] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice into quarter


### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the baby leaf salad and sliced cucumber in a bowl with the remaining cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber salad

### Step 8

Dollop the roasted garlic yoghurt onto a plate and top with a poached egg and spoon over the smoky butter

Serve the blistered tomatoes, sliced avocado, cucumber salad and the toasts to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
