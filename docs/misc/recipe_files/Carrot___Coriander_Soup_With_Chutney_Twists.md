### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Peel and roughly chop your<span class="text-danger"> </span>brown onion[s]

Top, tail and roughly dice your carrots (no need to peel!)

Chop the potato[es] (skin on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Boil a kettle

### Step 2

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a large pot with a lid over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once the onion has softened, add your ground cumin and ground coriander and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the diced carrot and chopped potato to the pot

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[780ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water

Add the vegetable stock, bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the carrot is fork-tender

While the soup is cooking, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

### Step 4

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then cut into 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>strips per person

Add the pastry strips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Spread your mango chutney over one side of each strip and sprinkle your nigella seeds on top

Twist each pastry strip from the ends in opposite directions until they look like a spiral

### Step 5

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook the pastry twists for 6-8 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your chutney twists

Meanwhile, heat a small dry pan over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 6

Roughly chop the toasted almonds

### Step 7

Once the vegetables have softened, remove the pot from the heat and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Stir in your cultured coconut and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!)

Season to taste with a generous grind of black pepper and salt – this is your carrot & coriander soup

### Step 8

Serve the carrot & coriander soup with the chutney twists to the side

Garnish the soup with the chopped almonds and the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
