## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 4 white potatoes
- 2 British chicken breasts
- 25g walnuts
- 50g baby kale
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop the potatoes roughly into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 15 min or until they're fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cover the chicken breasts in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and approx. 1cm in thickness


### Step 3

Combine the panko breadcrumbs with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt on a large plate

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up until the lemon and oil have combined - this is your lemon & olive oil mix


### Step 4

Dip the flattened chicken breasts in the lemon & olive oil mix then press firmly into the panko breadcrumbs until both sides are evenly coated

Add the coated chicken to one side of an oiled baking tray


### Step 5

Add the cherry tomatoes to the other side of the baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the tomatoes have started to blister and char


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash the baby kale then add it to a food processor

Peel the garlic and grate the cheddar cheese

Add the garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!), the grated cheddar, walnuts, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of the remaining lemon and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt to the food processor

Whizz it all up until blitzed but not smooth and set aside – this is your baby kale pesto


### Step 7

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot with a large knob of butter

Mash them until smooth

Add half of the baby kale pesto (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot, then mix to combine – this is your green mash

### Step 8

Serve the chicken Milanese over the green mash, with the roast tomatoes and remaining kale pesto to the side

Enjoy!
