## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water, a generous pinch of salt and half the chopped creamed coconut (you'll use the rest later!) to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your coconut rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Peel and quarter the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin and remove the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of the lemongrass and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly

### Step 4

Add the chopped shallot and ginger & garlic paste to a food processor with the chopped lemongrass, the remaining creamed coconut and the ground turmeric

Add most of the coriander, including the stalks (save some whole leaves for garnish!) with a very generous pinch of salt and a splash of water

Blitz until smooth – this is your turmeric marinade

### Step 5

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>pieces of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper and add the outer lemongrass layers with basa fillets to the middle of each piece of paper

Divide the turmeric marinade evenly over each basa fillet, top with a knob of butter alternative and scrunch the edges of the baking paper together to form a sealed parcel

Add the parcels to a baking tray

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1683203275774-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your turmeric basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, slice the cucumber into discs on the diagonal and season with a pinch of salt

Chop the tomatoes very finely

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened and sticky – this is your sambal tomat

### Step 8

Fan the sliced cucumber on a plate and top with the turmeric basa

Serve the coconut rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Top with the sambal tomat and garnish with the remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!
