### Step 1

Crispen the duck skin


Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7, and boil a kettle.


Using a sharp knife, score the duck skin on a diagonal, being careful not to cut through to the meat. Season with a pinch of salt.


Add the scored duck, skin-side down, to a cold, dry pan over a low-medium heat. Cook for 10-15 minutes, skin-side down only, or until the skin is golden and crispy.

### Step 2

Cook the sweet potatoes


Peel and cut the sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces.


Add the chopped sweet potatoes to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and bring to the boil.<br /><br />Cook for 10-15 minutes or until fork-tender.


Once done, drain and return them to the pot and cover to keep warm.

### Step 4

Finish the pomegranate sauce


Remove the duck fat and wipe the pan clean.<span class="text-highlight"> You can keep the duck fat in the fridge to use again on roast potatoes.</span>


Return the pan to a medium heat. 


Once hot, add the chicken stock, pomegranate molasses and honey and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently, or until a thick and sticky sauce remains.


Once done, remove from the heat and reheat just before serving.

### Step 5

Roast the duck


Meanwhile, put the duck breasts in the oven for 10-12 minutes for medium. Cook for a further 3-5 minutes if you prefer your duck well done. Once cooked, set the duck aside to rest for at least 10 minutes. 


Add the Tenderstem broccoli to a tray with a drizzle of vegetable <span class="text-highlight">oil</span><span class="text-highlight">. Add a pinch of salt and put it in the oven.</span>


After 5 minutes, add the pistachios to one side of the tray and cook for <span class="text-highlight">another 3 minutes or</span> <span class="text-highlight">until toasted.</span>

### Step 6

Prepare the sweet potato purée


Meanwhile, return the drained sweet potatoes to a very low heat with the grated Italian hard cheese and clotted cream and mash until smooth.


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your sweet potato purée.

### Step 7

Get your garnish ready


Chop the chives roughly.


Chop the toasted pistachios roughly.

### Step 8

Serve up!


Once the duck has rested, slice it finely on a diagonal.


Serve the sliced duck breast over the sweet potato purée (smear it with the back of a spoon for fancy presentation!) with the roasted Tenderstem to the side. 


Garnish the Tenderstem with the chopped pistachio &amp; chives and drizzle the pomegranate sauce all over.


Enjoy!
