### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, half your dried oregano, half your ground paprika (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crisp – these are your herby fries

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

### Step 5

Add your egg[s] to a separate bowl and beat together with a fork

Add half the Santorini-style tomato salad (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the remaining dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining ground paprika, chopped garlic, crumbled Greek cheese and a very generous pinch of salt and sugar

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 2 per person and cook for 4-5 min on one side or until golden

Carefully flip and cook for 4-5 min on the other side or until golden and cooked through – these are your Santorini-style tomato fritters

Add the torn lettuce to the bowl with the remaining Santorini-style tomato salad and toss together – this is your tomato salad

### Step 8

Serve the Santorini-style tomato fritters with the herby fries and tomato salad to the side

Season with a crack of black pepper
