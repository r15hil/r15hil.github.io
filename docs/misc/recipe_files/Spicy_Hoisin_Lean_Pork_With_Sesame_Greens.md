## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim, then cut your green beans in half


### Step 2

Cut a large piece of tin foil and lay the halved green beans and your mangetout in the middle

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and scrunch the edges up to form a tightly sealed parcel, put the parcel on a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!


### Step 3

While the greens are cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Finely slice some of your red chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 6

Once the pork mince has browned, add the chopped garlic, ginger and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add your hoisin sauce, cornflour and soy sauce with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> water and cook for a further 4 min or until the sauce becomes sticky and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy hoisin lean pork


### Step 7

Once the greens are done, remove the parcel[s] from the oven and drain away any excess water

Add them to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil and stir to combine – these are your sesame greens

### Step 8

Serve the spicy hoisin lean pork with the sesame greens over the cooked rice

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
