### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail and roughly chop the carrots

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of olive oil, over a medium-high heat

### Step 2

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped carrot, with a pinch of salt, and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 3

Add the garam masala, ground turmeric, chopped ginger, red lentils and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Rinse the edible sachet of vegetable stock under cold water, then dissolve in 1.2L <span class="text-danger">[2L] </span>boiled water (we've also popped a regular sachet of vegetable stock powder in if you'd prefer to trial the edible stock sachet another time)

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock to the pot and cook for 10-15 min or until the lentils and carrots are tender

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Place on a baking tray and add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 5-6 min or until crispy – these are your crispy croutons

### Step 6

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish later!)

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut into quarters

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1634575493790-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the lentils and carrots are tender, pulse with a (stick) blender (or food processor) until it has thickened, whilst keeping some of the vegetables chunky

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach and chopped coriander to the pot and cook for 2-3 min until wilted

Add the juice of 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> lime wedges – this is your Indian-style spiced carrot & lentil soup

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style spiced carrot & lentil soup in shallow bowls, and spoon the coconut yoghurt over the top

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserved coriander leaves, nigella seeds, crispy croutons and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
