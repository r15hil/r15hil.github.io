## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle and rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add your quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut the lemon[s] in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Combine the chopped garlic, honey, wholegrain mustard, dried oregano and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] in a small bowl

Season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your honey mustard marinade


### Step 4

Add your chicken thighs to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and drizzle over the honey mustard marinade, then give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baked honey mustard chicken


### Step 5

Whilst the chicken and quinoa are cooking, chop your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Add the chopped cucumber, chopped tomatoes, sliced shallot and the lemon zest to a large bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and toss – this is your Mediterranean-style salad


### Step 7

Once the quinoa is cooked, add the chopped parsley and chicken stock mix and stir everything together – this is your Mediterranean-style quinoa

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Mediterranean-style quinoa topped with the baked honey mustard chicken with the Mediterranean-style salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
