### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and your dried oregano, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice half your cucumber[s] into discs, cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard, then grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with half the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), half the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tzatziki

### Step 4

Slice your halloumi into 2 strips per person lengthways

### Step 5

Combine the sliced halloumi and your ground cumin in a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, remaining chopped garlic and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your marinated halloumi

### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated halloumi and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until crispy and golden brown on both sides – this is your crispy halloumi

### Step 7

Put your bread roll[s] in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty, then carefully slice in half before serving

Combine the sliced tomato and cucumber discs in a bowl with the remaining chopped mint, red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber & tomato salad

### Step 8

To assemble, top your crusty bread roll base with the crispy halloumi, a dollop of tzatziki, a handful of herby fries and the crusty bread roll lid – this is your halloumi Souvlaki-style sandwich

Serve the remaining herby fries, cucumber & tomato salad and any remaining tzatziki with the cooked chicken breast to the side

Enjoy!
