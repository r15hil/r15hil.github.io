## Description

Made with soy sauce, mirin & honey, the lightly sweet, umami-rich flavour of teriyaki sauce pairs perfectly with the delicate flavour of basa. You'll roast Tenderstem broccoli until it's crisp to make this delicious fish dish as balanced as a Japanese zen garden! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

## Ingredients

- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 30ml soy sauce
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 130g basmati rice
- 25g honey
- 120g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 tbsp mirin
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 350°F/ Gas 4


Add the basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Add the Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt


Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until crispy


### Step 3

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the basa fillets and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Once done, remove the pan from the heat, transfer the basa fillets to a plate and cover in tin foil until serving


### Step 6

Add the soy sauce, mirin and honey to the pan


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium heat and cook the sauce for 2-3 min or until a sticky sauce has formed – this is your teriyaki sauce


Tip: mix the sauce well to make sure it doesn't burn!

### Step 8

Serve the fish with the roast Tenderstem and rice to the side


Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Spoon the teriyaki sauce over everything and garnish with the chopped spring onion and sesame seeds


Enjoy!
