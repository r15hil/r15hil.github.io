### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and lightly golden

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) into wedges and remove the core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Dice half the apple finely

Slice the remaining apple finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 4

Once the onion has slightly softened, add the pork mince and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Dissolve half the chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water with the Dijon mustard and half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!) – this is your Dijon stock

Once the pork has browned, add the chopped garlic, diced apple, dried sage and Chinese rice wine and cook for 2-3 min or until the apple is starting to soften

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 1 min, then add the Dijon stock (reserve the jug) and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the pork is cooked (no pink meat!) 

Transfer the cooked pork (reserve the pan) to an oven-proof dish and carefully top with alternating potato discs (they will be hot!) and sliced apple

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and the potatoes are golden – this is your pork, apple & sage potato-topped pie

### Step 6

Wash the shredded spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the pie is nearly ready, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter, then once melted, add the shredded spring greens to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once the spring greens are tender, add the blanched peas and cook, uncovered, for a further 1-2 min or until warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1678199933349-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the greens are cooking, combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour, the remaining chicken stock mix and a pinch of pepper in the reserved jug

Stir in 130ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water gradually, then add a knob of butter and the remaining soy sauce – this is your gravy mix

Put the gravy mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring halfway – this is your gravy

### Step 8

Serve the pork, apple & sage potato-topped pie with the greens and gravy to the side

Enjoy!
