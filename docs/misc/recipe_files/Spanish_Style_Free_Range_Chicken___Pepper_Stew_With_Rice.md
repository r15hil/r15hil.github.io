## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 60g pitted black olives
- 0 chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 0 cherry tomatoes
- 16g tomato paste
- 0 white long grain rice
- 320g free range British skinless chicken thighs
- 130g white long grain rice
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your free range chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Sprinkle over your ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Whilst the chicken is in the oven, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes and half the chopped garlic with a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has slightly softened

Once slightly softened, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until the cherry tomatoes begin to break down


### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop your black olives roughly


### Step 6

Add the tomato stock, chopped pepper and chopped black olives to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

Meanwhile, combine the remaining garlic (Don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), white wine vinegar and mayo in a small bowl and mix everything together – this is your garlic aioli


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Add the pulled chicken and your dried oregano to the pan and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the chicken is warmed through

Season generously with black pepper – this is your Spanish-style free range chicken & pepper stew

### Step 8

Serve the Spanish-style free range chicken & pepper stew over the cooked rice

Drizzle the garlic aioli all over

Enjoy!
