## Ingredients

- Red chilli
- British white crab meat (100g)
- Lime
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- British white crab meat (50g) x0
- Coriander (10g)
- Coriander (5g) x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Avocado
- Rocket (20g)

- Shallot x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Dice your tomato[es]


### Step 2

Stack your tortillas and cut them into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Once crisped, set aside to cool a little

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon

Scoop out the avocado flesh using a spoon and dice roughly


### Step 4

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 5

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with the diced tomato, diced avocado, half the chopped coriander (you’ll use the rest later!) and the juice of half the lime[s]

Add a large drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your tomato & avocado salsa


### Step 6

Combine your mayo, lime zest, remaining chopped coriander, and a little crab meat (save most of it for later!) in a separate bowl

Season with a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your zesty crab


### Step 7

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the tomato & avocado salsa and gently mix it through – this is your tomato & avocado salsa salad

### Step 8

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Add the nachos to a bowl and spoon over the tomato & avocado salsa salad

Top with the zesty crab and sprinkle over the remaining crab meat and sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
