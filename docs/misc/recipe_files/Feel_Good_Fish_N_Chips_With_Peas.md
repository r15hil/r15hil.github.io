### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp

Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives with your panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt in a bowl
