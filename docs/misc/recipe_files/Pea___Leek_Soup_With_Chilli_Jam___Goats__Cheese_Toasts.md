### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel your potato[es] and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a pot with a lid with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until golden

Once golden, add a little chilli relish (you'll use the rest later!), mix to combine then transfer to a bowl and set aside, reserve the pot – this is your garlic & chilli oil

### Step 3

Wipe the reserved pot clean and return it to a medium heat with a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L] </span>boiled water

### Step 4

Once the leek has softened, add the remaining sliced garlic and your dried thyme and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped potato with the vegetable stock and a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the potato is fork-tender

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Add the halved ciabatta to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray under the grill for an initial 1-2 min or until beginning to brown

Once browned, remove the tray from the grill and top with the remaining chilli relish, crumbled goats' cheese and grated cheddar

Return the tray to the grill for a further 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your chilli jam & goats' cheese toasts

### Step 7

Once the potato is fork-tender, stir through your blanched peas with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your pea & leek soup

### Step 8

Serve the pea & leek soup in a bowl, season with a grind of black pepper and drizzle over the garlic & chilli oil

Serve the chilli jam & goats' cheese toasts to the side

Enjoy!
