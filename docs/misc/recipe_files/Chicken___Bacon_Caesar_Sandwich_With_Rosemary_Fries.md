## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Strip your rosemary leaves off their stems (discard the stems) and chop finely

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, half the chopped rosemary (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and cooked through


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season with the remaining chopped rosemary and a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the rosemary chicken, skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped


### Step 3

Zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Add the browned rosemary chicken to a tin foil-lined tray (reserve the pan!) with your dried oregano, dried basil, lemon zest, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp then transfer to kitchen paper – this is your crispy bacon


### Step 5

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Add half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) to a bowl along with your mayo, the juice of half your lemon[s], the grated garlic and a grind of black pepper – this is your Caesar dressing


### Step 6

Slice your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Separate 1 outer leaf per person from the lettuce

Cut the remaining lettuce into quarters, lengthways

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until it's warm and crusty, then carefully slice in half before serving


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and pull it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan along with the juice of the remaining lemon and give everything a good mix up – this is your Caesar chicken

### Step 8

To build, fill the warmed ciabatta with some Caesar dressing, Caesar chicken, crispy bacon, sliced tomato and an outer lettuce leaf – this is your chicken & bacon Caesar sandwich

Serve the lettuce quarters with a drizzle of Caesar dressing and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian cheese

Serve the rosemary fries to the side

Enjoy!
