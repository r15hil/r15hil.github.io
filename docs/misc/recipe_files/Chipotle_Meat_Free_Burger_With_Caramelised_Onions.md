### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook the onions, stirring frequently, until ready to serve or until they have softened and caramelised

### Step 3

Add your meat-free patty[ies] to one side of a tin foil-lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

### Step 4

While the burger is cooking, combine your mayo with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl and season with salt and pepper – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the outer lettuce leaves for one per person and set them aside for serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into bite-sized pieces

### Step 6

Add the torn lettuce to a bowl, mix with a drizzle of olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper – this is your crisp lettuce salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1599207966581-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the patty[ies] are almost cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray, cut side up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the brioche is warmed through and slightly toasted

### Step 8

To assemble, top each toasted brioche base with a reserved lettuce leaf, a generous dollop of chipotle mayo, a meat-free patty, caramelised onions and a toasted brioche lid – this is your chipotle meat-free burger with caramelised onions

Serve any remaining chipotle mayo with the chips and crisp lettuce salad to the side

Enjoy!
