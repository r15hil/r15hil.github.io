### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Trim, then slice the green beans in half (chop them in one bunch for speed!)

### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the halved green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Add the toasted sesame oil, mirin, rice vinegar, miso paste, ginger paste and soy sauce to a bowl

Add 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water and mix well – this is your miso sauce

Once the green beans have started to soften, add the miso sauce to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to thicken

### Step 5

Add the smoked basa fillets to the pan and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the fish is cooked through and the beans are tender – this is your steamed miso basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>on the diagonal

### Step 8

Serve the steamed miso basa, miso sauce and softened green beans with the long grain rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, black sesame seeds and crispy onions

Enjoy!
