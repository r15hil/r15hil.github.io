### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook the onion for 6-8 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your green lentils

### Step 3

Once the onion has caramelised, add a knob of butter to the pot with the chopped garlic, basmati rice, ground turmeric and baharat

Give everything a good mix up

Add your tamarind paste, tomato paste, soy sauce and vegetable stock mix with 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1050ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water and the drained lentils

### Step 4

Season with a small pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-14 min or until the rice is cooked – this is your soup

### Step 5

Meanwhile, top and tail your pomegranate[s] then slice into quarters

Place the pomegranate quarters in a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the seeds easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a sieve and set them aside for later

### Step 6

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Once the soup is ready, add most of the chopped mint & dill (save some for a garnish!)

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your Persian-style rice & lentil aash soup

### Step 8

Serve the Persian-style rice & lentil aash soup with the natural yoghurt drizzled over the top

Scatter over your pomegranate, crispy onions and the remaining chopped dill & mint

Enjoy!
