## Ingredients

- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 32g tomato paste 
- 11g chicken stock mix 
- 130g basmati rice
- 15g flaked almonds 
- 25g honey 
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and grate the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the grated onion, chopped garlic and chopped ginger with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid, and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, cut the chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the curry powder and ground paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the chicken pieces and cook for 3-4 min further or until coated in all of the spices


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, dissolve the tomato paste, chicken stock mix and honey in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, add the clotted cream and cook for 1 min further or until melted – this is your chicken tikka masala

### Step 8

Serve the chicken tikka masala with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the flaked almonds

Enjoy!
