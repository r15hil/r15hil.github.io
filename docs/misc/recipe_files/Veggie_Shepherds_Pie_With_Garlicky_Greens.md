## Ingredients

- Spring greens (150g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Green lentils (390g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Lighter cheese (30g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Carrot x2
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Thyme (5g)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-8 min or until softened slightly


### Step 3

While the onion and carrot are softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chestnut mushrooms into quarters (or rip them up with your hands to save time)

Strip your thyme leaves from their stalks, discard the stalks

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves


### Step 4

Once softened, add the chopped mushrooms, half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and the thyme leaves to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2 min

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your green lentils

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and Henderson's Relish in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Add the drained lentils and tomato stock to the pan and reduce the heat to low – this is your lentil mixture

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 6

Pour the lentil mixture into the base of an oven-proof dish, then spread the mash evenly on top and grate over the lighter cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your veggie shepherd’s pie

While your pie is cooking, wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining chopped garlic and the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt

Cook for 4 min or until the spring greens are cooked with a slight bite – these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Once cooked, remove the veggie shepherd's pie from the oven and leave to stand for a few min as it will be extremely hot! (this will also help the flavours develop)

Serve the veggie shepherd's pie with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!
