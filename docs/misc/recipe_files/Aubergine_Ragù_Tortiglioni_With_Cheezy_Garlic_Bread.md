### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk[s] on

Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, then add the aubergine half[ves] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the flesh has softened

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your basil finely

Grate your cheddar flavour block[s] finely

Add half of the chopped basil, half the grated cheeze (save the rest for garnish!) and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your cheezy garlic mixture

### Step 3

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tortiglioni, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 4

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften and caramelise

### Step 5

Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened aubergine flesh out of the skins with a spoon, pulling it apart as you go – this is your pulled aubergine

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily, then discard the skins and reserve the tray[s]!

Once the onion has started to soften, add the pulled aubergine, remaining chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2 min until fragrant

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1612800018075-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, Henderson's Relish and a pinch of sugar and stir for 30 secs

Add your vegetable stock mix with a splash of starchy pasta water and cook for 4-5 min until the sauce has the consistency of bolognese – this is your aubergine ragù

Tip: Add another splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1612800035642-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the ragù is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into 3 slices per person and add the slices to the reserved baking tray[s]

Top each ciabatta slice with a spoonful of the cheezy garlic mixture and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until all the cheeze has melted – this is your cheezy garlic bread

Stir the tortiglioni through the aubergine ragù – this is your aubergine ragù tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine ragù tortiglioni in bowls with the cheezy garlic bread to the side

Sprinkle over the reserved chopped basil and top with the reserved grated cheeze

Enjoy!
