## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4, and boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice into half moons

Add the chopped courgette to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until softened


### Step 3

Add your lamb mince to the onion and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, or until starting to brown


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste and balsamic vinegar to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 5

Add the beef stock and a pinch of sugar to the pan and cook for 15-20 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese sauce-like consistency – this is your sauce

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 7

Once thickened, add your roasted courgette to the sauce and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry!

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your Tuscan lamb & roasted courgette ragù

### Step 8

Add the cooked tortiglioni to the pan with the Tuscan lamb & roasted courgette ragù and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce

Serve in bowls, garnished with the chopped basil and grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
