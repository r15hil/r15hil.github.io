## Instructions


### Step 1

<span class="text-highlight">Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6 and boil a kettle, then peel and slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> </span>


<span class="text-highlight">Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</span>


### Step 2

<span class="text-highlight">While the onion is cooking, cut</span> the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into large, bite-sized pieces


Strip the thyme leaves and chop finely, discarding the stems 


Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper


Unwrap the puff pastry and cut it into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> squares 


Score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife


Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your pie lids


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chicken to the pan and cook for 3-4 mins further or until starting to brown


Add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour with the Chinese rice wine, chicken stock, Dijon mustard and soft cheese and cook for 8-10 min further or until the sauce has thickened


Once thickened, stir through the ham hock and chopped thyme – this is your creamy chicken &amp; ham hock filling


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces


Peel the garlic cloves


Add the potatoes and garlic to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 15 min or until fork-tender


Once done, drain and set aside to steam dry


Boil a kettle


### Step 6

Once the potatoes have been boiling for 10 min, add the Tenderstem broccoli and asparagus spears to a pot of boiling water and cook for 4-5 min or until tender with a slight bite


Drain and set aside until serving


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes and garlic to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a large knob of butter


Mash until smooth, then season generously with salt – this is your garlic mash

### Step 8

Season the creamy chicken &amp; ham hock filling with a generous grind of black pepper and serve with the green veg and garlic mash to the side


Top the filling with the pie lid


Enjoy!
