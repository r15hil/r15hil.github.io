## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water and add your saffron, then leave to infuse – this is your saffron stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic with your arborio rice and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the saffron stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 5

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] to a mixing bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and whisk to combine – this is your lemon dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Once the risotto is ready, remove it from the heat and season with a pinch of salt

Tip: Your risotto should be porridge-like in consistency so if it is looking a little dry, add a splash of water

Stir most of your crab meat (save some for garnish!) and your clotted cream through the risotto – this is your saffron, crab & clotted cream risotto


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad in the lemon dressing – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the saffron, crab & clotted cream risotto topped with the dressed salad and reserved crab meat with a lemon wedge to the side

Season generously with pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
