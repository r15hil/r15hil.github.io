## Description

This quick spring supper is inspired by an Alsatian classic. Tarte Flambée is traditionally made from thin bread dough, topped with a creamy sauce, bacon and onion. You'll use naan as a speedy alternative, add fresh British asparagus and serve with lamb's lettuce salad and a balsamic dressing. Délicieuse!
