## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then once done, remove from the heat and set aside to cool


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Once beginning to brown, add the crumbled mushrooms and sliced pepper and cook for 4-5 min further or until softened and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Once softened, add your red Thai curry paste and ginger & garlic paste with a pinch of salt


### Step 6

Heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 7

While the egg is cooking, add the cooked rice to the pan with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your Thai-style sausage fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style fried rice in a bowl topped with the fried egg

Drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and top with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
