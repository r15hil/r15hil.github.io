## Ingredients

- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Haddock bites (100g) x0
- Haddock bites (200g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly then top, tail and slice finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 550ml <span class="text-purple">[775ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1L]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy vegetable stock


### Step 5

Once the leek has softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the creamy vegetable stock and chopped potatoes and cook for 15-18 min or until the potatoes are almost fork-tender


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add your haddock bites and soft cheese to the pot and cook for 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through and the potatoes are fork-tender

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Season to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the haddock and potatoes are cooking, chop your chives finely

Grate your cheddar cheese

Once everything is done, add the grated cheddar cheese to the pot and gently stir everything together – this is your one-pot cheesy haddock & leek chowder

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot cheesy haddock & leek chowder 

Garnish with the chopped chives and season with a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!
