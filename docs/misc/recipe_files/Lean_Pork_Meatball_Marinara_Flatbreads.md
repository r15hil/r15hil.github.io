Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and chopped tomatoes and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinara sauce

Add your naan[s] to a baking tray (or two!)

Spread 1/3 of the marinara sauce over the naan[s] in a thin layer and top with the meatballs and mozzarella pieces

Put the naan[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the mozzarella is starting to crisp and brown – this is your meatball marinara flatbread
