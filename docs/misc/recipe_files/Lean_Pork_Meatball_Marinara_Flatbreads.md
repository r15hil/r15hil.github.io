## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add your lean pork mince to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, divide and roll into 6 meatballs per person


### Step 2

Dissolve your beef stock mix and a pinch of sugar in 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and chopped tomatoes and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinara sauce


### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add your naan[s] to a baking tray (or two!)

Spread 1/3 of the marinara sauce over the naan[s] in a thin layer and top with the meatballs and mozzarella pieces

Put the naan[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the mozzarella is starting to crisp and brown – this is your meatball marinara flatbread


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat and cook the remaining marinara sauce for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your marinara dip


### Step 6

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then rip into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing

Toss the torn lettuce and grated carrot with the balsamic dressing – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the meatball marinara flatbread alongside the salad and a pot of the marinara dip

Enjoy!
