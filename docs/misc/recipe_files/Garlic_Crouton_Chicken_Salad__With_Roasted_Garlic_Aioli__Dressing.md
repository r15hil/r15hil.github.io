### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add half your garlic cloves (skins on) to a piece of tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil, a small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt

### Step 2

Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the garlic to form a sealed parcel

Add the garlic parcel to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the garlic is soft

Once soft, carefully remove the skins from the roasted garlic, mash with a fork and set aside – this is your mashed roasted garlic

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 4

Once the chicken is golden, add a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cooked chicken

### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Combine the chopped parsley, chopped garlic and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) in a bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water<span class="text-danger"> </span>and a generous pinch of salt – this is your cheesy garlic oil

### Step 6

Tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to a separate baking tray with the cheesy garlic oil

Give everything a good mix up so the ciabatta is fully coated and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until crisp – these are your garlic bread croutons

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the mashed roasted garlic and mayo in a bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your roasted garlic aioli dressing

Wash your salad, pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

Top the salad with the tomato wedges, sliced chicken and garlic bread croutons

Drizzle over the roasted garlic aioli dressing and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
