Preheat the grill to medium-high

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into chunky strips (don't cut them too thin!)

### Step 2

Add the pepper strips to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray under the grill for 7-8 min or until the peppers are lightly charred – these are your charred peppers
