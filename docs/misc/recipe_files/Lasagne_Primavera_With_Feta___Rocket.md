## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 20g rocket
- 1 courgette 
- 100g feta cheese
- 160g blanched peas
- 1/2 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 1 leek 
- 80g baby leaf spinach
- 6 lasagne sheets 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced leeks with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 7 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, melt 30g<span class="text-danger"> [60g]</span> butter and 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season with pepper – this is your béchamel


### Step 3

Chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Once the leek has softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the courgette to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until cooked


### Step 4

While the courgette is cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

Crumble the feta cheese


### Step 5

Once the courgette is cooked, wash and add the baby leaf spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for 2 min further or until wilted


### Step 6

Once wilted, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the blanched peas and crumbled feta – this is your feta vegetable mix


### Step 7

Layer 1/3 of the feta vegetable mix over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, top with 2 lasagne sheets then top with a 1/3 of the béchamel, repeating this process twice until you end up with a final layer of béchamel

Top with the grated cheese, and cook in the oven for 30-35 min or until the pasta is cooked – this is your lasagne primavera

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on your dish!

### Step 8

Leave the lasagne primavera to cool for 5 min before serving

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the lasagne primavera with the rocket on the side

Drizzle the rocket with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
