### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Season the chicken thigh skins generously with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, once hot, add the chicken (skin-side down) and cook for 10-12 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

### Step 2

Meanwhile, rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the chestnut mushrooms roughly

### Step 4

Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Trim, then lay the green beans in the middle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the beans to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 5

Once the chicken skin is crispy, transfer the browned chicken to a baking tray (skin-side up) and reserve the pan

Add the green bean parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the baking tray with the chicken and put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Boil half a kettle

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with any remaining oil

Add the chopped mushrooms and sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until they're browned and caramelised

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1601372968364-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the mushrooms have caramelised, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock and cook for 2-3 min or until it's starting to thicken

Once thickened, reduce the heat to low and add the crème fraîche and wholegrain mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!) and cook for 1-2 min until a smooth and thick sauce remains – this is your creamy mustard sauce

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken thighs and serve them over the brown rice with the creamy mustard sauce and green beans to the side

Enjoy!
