### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Preheat your grill to a medium-high heat

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Add your creamed coconut to a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened

### Step 3

While the onion softens, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the rinsed red lentils and drained chickpeas

Add the vegetable stock and softened creamed coconut and cook for 15-20 min or until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are tender and porridge-like in consistency – this is your dal

### Step 5

While the dal is cooking, slice your flat white mushroom[s] into wedges

Add the mushroom wedges to a tin foil-lined baking tray with the remaining sliced onion, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Place under the grill for 5-10 min or until nicely charred (keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn) – this is your crispy mushroom & onion

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Grind the chopped garlic and chopped ginger in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste, then transfer the paste to a mixing bowl

Add the chopped coriander, your rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the paste and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything very finely

### Step 8

Taste the dal for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if it's looking a little dry!

Serve the dal topped with the crispy mushroom & onion – this is your crispy mushroom dal

Dollop the coriander chutney all over

Enjoy!
