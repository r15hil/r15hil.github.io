### Step 1

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice lengthways finely – this is your julienne chilli

### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and half the julienne chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min or until soft

Boil half a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste and tamarind paste with your ground turmeric and garam masala and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water with your creamed coconut and cornflour – this is your coconut stock

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the chopped sweet potato, chopped tomato and the coconut stock with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 12-15 min or until the sweet potato is fork tender

Drain your king prawns

### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is tender, add the drained king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your Malaysian-style kari udang prawn curry
