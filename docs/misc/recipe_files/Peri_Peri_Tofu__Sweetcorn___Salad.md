## Instructions


### Step 1

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into cubes

Add the tofu cubes to a bowl with your soy sauce and set aside to marinate

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]


### Step 2

Combine your chipotle paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your tomato paste, dried oregano and the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] in a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water, a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your peri peri sauce


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated tofu cubes and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp


### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Drain and rinse your red kidney beans

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper, then remove 6 <span class="text-purple">[8]</span> <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> outer leaves and set aside for later

Shred the inner core[s]


### Step 5

Add the peri peri sauce to the pan with the tofu and cook over a high heat for 2-3 min turning a few times or until the sauce has reduced and the tofu is coated

Once done, remove from the pan and set aside for later (save the pan!) – this is your peri peri tofu


### Step 6

Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl combine the juice of the remaining lemon with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your tangy lemon dressing


### Step 7

Add the sliced shallot, drained sweetcorn and drained red kidney beans to the reserved pan with your ground smoked paprika and cook for 2-3 min further or until the shallot has softened – this is your smoky sweetcorn & beans

### Step 8

Assemble the salad with the reserved lettuce leaves first, then add the smoky sweetcorn & beans and the shredded lettuce

Top with the peri peri tofu and drizzle over the tangy lemon dressing

Enjoy!
