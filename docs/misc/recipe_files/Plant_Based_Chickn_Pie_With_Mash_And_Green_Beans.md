## Ingredients

- Carrot x2
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- White potato x3
- Marmite (8g)
- Garlic clove
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Combine 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water in a measuring jug with your Marmite and vegetable stock mix – this is your Marmite stock


### Step 4

Once softened, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and your dried thyme and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the Marmite stock with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your pie mix

Meanwhile, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is large enough to cover an oven-proof dish


### Step 5

Shred your meat-free chick'n using two forks, then add to the pie mix and stir it all together

Transfer the pie mix to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Top the pie mix with the rolled pastry and crimp round the edge with a fork

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your plant-based chick’n pie


### Step 6

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your mash


### Step 7

Trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based chick'n pie with the mash and green beans to the side

Enjoy!
