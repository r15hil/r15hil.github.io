## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Henderson's Relish (15ml) x2
- Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms (180g)
- Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms (90g) x0
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Brown onion
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips

Add the chunky chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until beginning to char


### Step 3

While the Fable pulled mushrooms are cooking, slice your cucumber finely into rounds

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Once the Fable pulled mushrooms have charred, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the sliced onion to the pan along with a pinch of sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 5-6 min or until the onion is beginning to brown


### Step 5

Add the cucumber rounds to a bowl with your white wine vinegar, 1/4 of your wholegrain mustard (you'll use the rest later!) and pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 6

Combine your mayo and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with a grind of black pepper – this is your garlic mayo

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until warm and crusty, then slice in half


### Step 7

Once the onion is golden, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour, Henderson's Relish, soy sauce, remaining grated garlic, remaining wholegrain mustard and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min or until the liquid has reduced to a thick gravy-like consistency – this is your Fable mushroom 'brisket'

### Step 8

Fill your warm ciabatta with the Fable mushroom 'brisket' and some of the quick-pickled cucumber

Serve the chunky chips, remaining quick-pickled cucumber and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
