### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

### Step 4

### Step 6

Whilst the risotto is cooking, cut your ciabatta[s] into small cubes

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the ciabatta cubes to a baking tray with the remaining chopped garlic, most of the chopped parsley and most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the croutons are toasted

Combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl with a generous grind of black pepper

Add your rocket and give everything a good mix up

Enjoy!
