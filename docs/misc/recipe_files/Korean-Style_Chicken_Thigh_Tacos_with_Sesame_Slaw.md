Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, keeping the whites and greens separate

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly browned all over

Tip: Unevenly sized diced chicken thigh? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Dissolve your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chicken stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> warm water

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar, your ground paprika, half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your gochujang stock

### Step 4

Once the chicken is lightly browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the gochujang stock

Stir it all together and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Korean-style glazed chicken

### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, combine your shredded red cabbage, grated carrot and spring onion whites in a large bowl – this is your slaw mix

### Step 6

Add your mayo, remaining rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil and a generous pinch of pepper to the slaw mix

Mix until fully combined – this is your sesame slaw

### Step 7

When the chicken is nearly cooked, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the sesame slaw and Korean-style glazed chicken

Drizzle over any remaining glaze and top with the sliced spring onion greens and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
