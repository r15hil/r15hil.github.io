### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to a bowl with half of your Henderson's Relish (save the rest for later!) and gently mix together until the prawns are fully coated – these are your marinated prawns

Set aside for later


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky paprika chips


### Step 3

Combine the remaining Henderson's Relish, ketchup and half of your mayo (save the rest for later!) in a bowl – this is your Marie Rose sauce


### Step 4

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your chives finely

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s] and remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado flesh and mash with a fork


### Step 5

Add the remaining mayo, roasted garlic paste and chopped chives to a separate bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your roasted garlic & chive mayo


### Step 6

Drain the marinated prawns

Add your cornflour to the drained prawns with a generous grind of pepper

Give it a good mix up until the prawns are fully coated – these are your floured prawns


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the floured prawns and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your crispy jumbo prawns

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add them, cut side up to a separate baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for for 2-3 min or until toasted

### Step 8

To build, fill the toasted ciabatta halves with some salad, the crispy jumbo prawns, the Marie Rose sauce and a dollop of mashed avocado  – this is your crispy jumbo prawn cocktail sarnie

Serve the smoky paprika chips and the remaining salad to the side with the roasted garlic & chive mayo spooned over the top

Enjoy!
