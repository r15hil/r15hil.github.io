## Ingredients

- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Cumin seeds (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- White potato x3
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Garlic clove
- Cooked beetroot (250g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your potatoes into chips

Drain your beetroot in a colander over the sink

Cut half the drained beetroot into chips (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 2

Add the potato & beetroot chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp and golden

Whilst the chips are in the oven, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic and grate the remaining beetroot

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add the sliced garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cumin seeds and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant, then add the grated beetroot and half your white wine vinegar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened – this is your cumin spiced beetroot relish

Once thickened, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Meanwhile, line a baking tray with tin foil

Add your ultimate vegan burger patties to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

While the patties are in the oven, combine your mayo and mango chutney with a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl – this is your dressing


### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the chips are almost cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the brioche halves, cut side up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Add the shredded lettuce to the bowl with the dressing and toss


### Step 7

Spread the mango mayo over the warmed brioche halves

Top each base with a little dressed lettuce a meat-free patty, the cumin spiced beetroot relish and a brioche lid – these are your plant-based burgers with cumin spiced beetroot relish

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based burger with cumin spiced beetroot relish with the potato & beetroot chips and any remaining dressed lettuce to the side

Enjoy!
