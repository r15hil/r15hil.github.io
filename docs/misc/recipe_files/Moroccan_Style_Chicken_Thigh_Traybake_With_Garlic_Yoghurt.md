### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s], then chop the remaining red onion into wedges

Peel and finely grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced onion to a small bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside – this is your softened sliced onion

### Step 3

Add your chicken thighs and chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper, onion wedges and 2/3 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your ras el hanout and a drizzle of olive oil to the tray[s] with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is tender

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt with the remaining grated garlic in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this your garlic yoghurt

### Step 6

Drain and rinse the softened sliced onion in a sieve under cold running water

Once cooled, return it to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir it all together and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled onion

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Once the chicken and veg are done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the couscous

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Moroccan-style chicken thigh traybake

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style chicken thigh traybake with the garlic yoghurt dolloped over

Garnish with the quick-pickled onion and chopped parsley

Enjoy!
