- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)

- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Sushi rice (150g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle, then add the rinsed sushi rice to an oven-proof dish with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 2

Once cooked, transfer the rice to a plate and set aside for 10 min or until the rice is cooled

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away, then slice finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a small bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar, then stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 3

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and the grated garlic in a small bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar – this is your dipping sauce


### Step 4

Add your diced chicken thigh to a large bowl with the remaining soy sauce, then set aside to marinate


### Step 5

Combine your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and your mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add your edamame beans to a bowl with half of the sriracha mayo (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) (save some for garnish!) and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your edamame salad


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Add your cornflour to the marinated chicken and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy soy chicken


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooled, roll into 3 balls per person (clean hands is the best way!) – these are your sushi rice balls

Tip: Use wet hands to make it easier!

Drain the quick-pickled cucumber, reserve the pickling liquid

### Step 8

Serve the crispy soy chicken with the sushi rice balls, edamame salad and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the remaining sriracha mayo over the rice balls and sprinkle over your shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and black sesame seeds

Combine the reserved pickling liquid and the dipping sauce and serve it to the side and enjoy!
