### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into chunks

### Step 3

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] to the dish with a generous knob of butter and cook for 3 min or until very lightly browned

Drain your sweetcorn

### Step 5

Add the chopped pepper, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your white long grain rice to the dish

Add 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with the chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Add the drained sweetcorn to a serving bowl with half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!), the juice of half your lime[s] and a drizzle of olive oil then crumble over your feta

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your esquites

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1722521976226-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once everything's cooked through, remove the dish from the oven

Shred the cooked chicken apart using two forks and fluff the rice – this is your smoky coriander chicken & rice

### Step 8

To serve, garnish the smoky coriander chicken & rice with the remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Serve the esquites to the side

Dig in!
