## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chopped creamed coconut in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and coconut stock to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your coconut rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your shallots

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Chop your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

Chop your lime leaves roughly


### Step 4

Add the chopped shallot, ginger, garlic, lime leaves and ground turmeric to a food processor with the chopped red chilli and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water

Blitz into a paste – this is your fiery sambal

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the fiery sambal and cook for 2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Whilst the fiery sambal is cooking, dissolve your tamarind paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and your soy sauce and stir it all together – this is your tamarind stock


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the tamarind stock to the pan with the fiery sambal and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and add your meat-free chick'n and blanched edamame beans

Cook for 3-4 min or until the meat-free chick'n is warmed through and the edamame beans are tender with a bite – this is your Indonesian-style fiery meat-free chick'n broth

### Step 8

Serve the Indonesian-style fiery meat-free chick'n broth with the coconut rice to the side

Enjoy!
