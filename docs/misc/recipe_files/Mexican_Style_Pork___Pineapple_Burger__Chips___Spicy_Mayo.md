## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips


### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add your pineapple slices (save the juice for later!) to a separate tray

Put both trays in the oven for 25 min or until the pineapple is golden and the chips are crispy


### Step 3

While the chips are cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the toasted cumin seeds to a large bowl and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Add your pork mince (remove paper if required!), soy sauce, ground smoked paprika and panko breadcrumbs to the large bowl with toasted cumin seeds

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 equal-sized burger patty per person

Tip: kneading the patties for longer will make them more tender!


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the burger patty[ies] to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)

Tip: Push the patties down with a spatula so they cook evenly


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the pineapple slices are nearly done, remove the tray from the oven, then add the sliced brioche bun[s], cut-side up, to the tray

Return the tray to the oven and cook for a final 3-4 min or until the bun is warmed through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your mayo with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> reserved pineapple juice and half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy mayo

Tip: Save the remaining cayenne for another recipe!

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper then chop into quarters lengthways – these are your lettuce wedges

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, top the brioche base with some of the spicy mayo, a burger patty, the roasted pineapple and finish with the brioche lid

Serve with the chips and lettuce wedges to the side

Drizzle the remaining spicy mayo over the wedges and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
