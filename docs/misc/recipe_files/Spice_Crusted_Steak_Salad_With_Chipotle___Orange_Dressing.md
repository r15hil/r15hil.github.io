### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary, and if you like your steak well-done, it may take you a little longer than 10 min

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Drizzle with vegetable oil and season all over with salt, pepper, ground cumin and dried oregano – this is your spice-crusted steak

### Step 3

Once very hot, add the spice-crusted steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and the juice of your orange[s]

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your chipotle & orange dressing

Add the drained black beans and soy sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Drizzle over the remaining chipotle & orange dressing

Enjoy!
