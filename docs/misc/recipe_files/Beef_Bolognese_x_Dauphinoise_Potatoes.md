Peel and finely slice your potatoes into thin discs (roughly the thickness of a £1 coin)

### Step 2

Add the potato discs to a baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Sprinkle with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened and slightly golden

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Once the onions and tomatoes have began to soften, add your beef mince to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min further or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Once browned, add your tomato paste to the pan with your beef stock mix, soy sauce, half your chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef bolognese sauce

Combine your double cream with the remaining garlic and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic cream

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1663067240477-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the beef bolognese sauce to an oven-proof dish (or use individual ones for fancy presentation) and top with layers of the cooked potatoes

Pour the garlic cream all over

Sprinkle over the grated cheese with a pinch of black pepper and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your beef bolognese x dauphinoise potatoes

### Step 8

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and your red wine vinegar – this is your dressed salad

Serve the beef bolognese x dauphinoise potatoes with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
