Meanwhile, drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the cornflour in a large bowl with the curry powder, ground turmeric, vegetable stock mix, a small pinch of salt and 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your pakora batter

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (don't chop!) the ginger

Chop the coriander (including the stalks) roughly

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, spoon the tofu pakora mix into the pan, roughly divided into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crisp – these are your tofu pakoras

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!

Enjoy!
