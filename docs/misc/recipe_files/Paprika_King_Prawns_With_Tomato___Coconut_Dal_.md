### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and a large pinch of sugar in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1L]</span> boiled water– this is your coconut stock

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, curry powder and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

### Step 4

Once fragrant, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water and add the rinsed red lentils to the pan with the coconut stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are almost cooked and the sauce has thickened

Drain your king prawns

While the lentils are cooking, add the drained king prawns to a bowl, then coat with your ground paprika and nigella seeds and give everything a good mix up

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your baby plum tomatoes in half

### Step 6

Add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for 5-7 min further or until the tomatoes have softened and the lentils are fully cooked

Stir most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) through the lentils – this is your tomato & coconut dal

### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated king prawns and cider vinegar and cook for 4-5 min until the prawns are cooked through – these are your paprika king prawns

Meanwhile, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the paprika king prawns over the tomato & coconut dal with the warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
