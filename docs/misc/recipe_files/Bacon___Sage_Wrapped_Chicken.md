## Description

Wrapping most things in bacon is good, right? This chicken is no exception. We've added fragrant sage, torn mushrooms (no, we've not lost it - they're quicker this way!), sage-buttered mash and an easy pan sauce. Now that, is a wrap!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, rip and tear the mushrooms up&nbsp;


Tip: ripping the mushrooms creates texture and saves time!

### Step 4

Place your hand flat on the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Carefully, slice the chicken in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces&nbsp;

### Step 5

Place a couple of sage leaves over each piece of chicken, then wrap each piece of chicken in 2 rashers of bacon


Add the wrapped chicken to the tray with the mushrooms


Put the tray directly under the grill and cook for 10-15 min or until the bacon has cooked and crisped and the chicken is cooked through

### Step 6

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and leave them in a colander, then return the pot to a medium-low heat with a large knob of butter


Add the remaining&nbsp;chopped sage and cook for 1 min, then add the potatoes, a big splash of milk and salt and pepper


Mash until smooth

### Step 7

Remove the cooked chicken and mushrooms from the grill&nbsp;


Transfer the chicken to a chopping board to rest a little&nbsp;


Sieve the mushrooms and collected juices into a small pan


Add the pan to a low heat and stir in the clotted cream until melted, then season with pepper - this is your pan sauce

### Step 8

Serve the chicken over the mash with the mushrooms dotted around and the pan sauce spooned over


Enjoy!
