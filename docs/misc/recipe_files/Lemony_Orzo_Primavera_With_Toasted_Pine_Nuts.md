### Step 5

Heat a small dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 6

Once the orzo has been cooking for 5 min, add the halved green beans and cook, covered, for a further 5 min

Add the halved Tenderstem and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until everything's tender with a slight bite

Tip: Add a splash more water if your orzo is looking a little dry, and stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking

### Step 7

Once done, add a knob of butter, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a very generous grind of black pepper

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until wilted, then add half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony orzo primavera

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the lemony orzo primavera

Top with the remaining grated Italian cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, the toasted pine nuts and season with a grind of black pepper

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
