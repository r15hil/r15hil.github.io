## Ingredients

- Pine nuts (15g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- British chicken breast portion
- Orzo (75g) x0
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g)
- Orzo (150g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Spinach (80g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Peel and finely slice your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add your orzo and cook for 1 min further


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 5 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, trim, then cut your green beans in half

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half lengthways


### Step 5

Heat a small dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 6

Once the orzo has been cooking for 5 min, add the halved green beans and cook, covered, for a further 5 min

Add the halved Tenderstem and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until everything's tender with a slight bite

Tip: Add a splash more water if your orzo is looking a little dry, and stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking


### Step 7

Once done, add a knob of butter, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a very generous grind of black pepper

Wash your spinach, then add it to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until wilted

Add half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony orzo primavera

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the lemony orzo primavera with the sliced chicken to the side

Top with the remaining grated Italian cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, the toasted pine nuts and season with a grind of black pepper

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
