## Description

There’s no better way to add some extra protein to your dinner than steak night. You’ll serve up your steak on a bed of garlic and tomato-infused black bean rice with a buttery corn on the cob before drizzling with spicy chipotle sauce. Banging. High in protein. Protein contributes to a growth in muscle mass

### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your rump steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Heat a pot with a lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, then once hot, add your tomato paste with half your roasted garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant, once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and chicken stock mix with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the rice is fully coated

### Step 2

Once the rice is fully coated, add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat – this is your seasoned rice

### Step 3

Whilst the rice is cooking, trim and thinly slice your spring onion[s]

Drain and rinse your black beans

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil (Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!)

### Step 4

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once very hot, add your steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak[s] is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest and reserve the pan

### Step 5

Whilst the steaks are cooking, add your sweetcorn cobette[s] to a heatproof bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 4-5 min or until the corn is tender

### Step 6

Once cooked, add the drained black beans to the seasoned rice

Stir together and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your black bean rice

Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining roasted garlic paste to the reserved pan, off the heat

Tip: Be careful, the garlic paste will sizzle from the heat of the oil!

### Step 7

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [90ml] </span>cold water with a pinch of sugar and any resting juices from the steak[s]

Stir it all together, return the pan to a medium heat and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 min or until thickened – this is your spicy chipotle sauce

### Step 8

Slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak over the black bean rice with the corn cobette[s] to the side

Top the corn cobette[s] with a small knob of butter

Drizzle the spicy chipotle sauce over the steak and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
