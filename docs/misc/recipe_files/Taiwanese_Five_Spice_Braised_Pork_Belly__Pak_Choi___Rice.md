## Ingredients

- 25g roasted peanuts 
- 1 x 300g British pork belly
- 15ml rice vinegar	
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 15ml tamari soy sauce
- 1 star anise
- 40g hoisin sauce
- 5g coriander
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Slice the pork belly finely with a sharp knife

Rub the five-spice and a pinch of salt all over the sliced pork belly so that it's fully coated in spice


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pork belly and cook for 3 min on each side or until it's browned

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Combine the tamari soy sauce and rice vinegar with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your braising liquid


### Step 3

Once browned, add the star anise and half of the sliced garlic to the pork belly and cook for 1 min further

Add the braising liquid and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 40-45 min or until the pork belly is tender


### Step 4

While the pork belly is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Crush the roasted peanuts with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose them!)


### Step 5

Once the pork has been cooking for 30 min, rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 6

Cut the base from the pak choi and separate into leaves

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan or wok (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pak choi, chopped ginger, remaining sliced garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the pak choi is tender with a slight bite


### Step 7

While the pak choi is cooking, add the hoisin sauce to the pork belly and cook over a medium-high heat for 1-2 min or until thick and sticky – this is your Taiwanese five-spice braised pork belly

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the Taiwanese five-spice braised pork belly over the cooked rice with the pak choi to the side

Garnish with the crushed peanuts and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
