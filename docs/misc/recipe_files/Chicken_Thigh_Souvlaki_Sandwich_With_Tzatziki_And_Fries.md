### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and soak your skewer[s] in cold water (this stops them from burning whilst cooking!)

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, your dried oregano and a pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced shallot to a large bowl with your chicken thighs, cumin seeds, ground smoked paprika, red wine vinegar, half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 3

Give everything a good mix up and season with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – these are your marinated chicken thighs

Thread the marinated chicken thighs onto the soaked skewer[s] in a snake-like fashion – this is your marinated chicken skewer[s]

### Step 4

Transfer the marinated chicken skewer[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 22-25 min or until the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken thigh souvlaki skewer[s]

Once cooked through, slide and chop half of the chicken thigh souvlaki off each skewer on a clean board

### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice half of your cucumber into discs

Cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

### Step 6

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1644330891625-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the grated cucumber to a small bowl with the remaining grated garlic, most of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt – this is your tzatziki

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty, then carefully slice in half before serving

### Step 8

To build your sandwich, fill your crusty ciabatta with the sliced chicken thigh souvlaki, a dollop of tzatziki, a couple of herby fries and a tomato round – this is your chicken thigh souvlaki sandwich

Serve the remaining herby fries to the side with the remaining chicken thigh souvlaki skewer, remaining tomato rounds, sliced cucumber and reserved chopped mint

Enjoy!
