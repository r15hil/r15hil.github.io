## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix 
- 300g British pork belly
- 32g tomato paste 
- 390g black beans
- 130g brown rice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 80g shredded kale
- 1 orange
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Pat the pork belly dry with kitchen paper

Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin

Season with a very generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a very high heat

Once very hot, add the pork belly, fat side down and cook for 4 min or until coloured and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side

Once done, transfer the pork to a tin foil lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 40 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it is tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Drain and rinse the black beans


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, smoked paprika, ground cumin, dried oregano, bay leaves and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2 min

Add the drained black beans, tomato paste, and chicken stock mix with 450ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 10-12 min

Wash the shredded kale


### Step 7

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the shredded kale with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until bright green and wilted

Once the beans are done, squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> orange – this is your black bean stew

### Step 8

Cut the remaining orange into wedges and slice the cooked pork belly finely

Serve the black bean stew over the cooked brown rice, with wilted greens and orange wedges to the side

Top with the pork belly slices

Enjoy!
