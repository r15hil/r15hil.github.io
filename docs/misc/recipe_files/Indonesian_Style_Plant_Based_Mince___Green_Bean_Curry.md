## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 250g THIS plant-based mince
- 160g fine green beans
- 0 fine green beans
- 0 white basmati rice
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 130g basmati rice
- 0 ground turmeric
- 15g tamarind paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion[s] and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Break your cardamom pods open with the side of a knife, discarding the outer green pods


### Step 4

Once the onion has started to soften, add your plant-based mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, tamarind paste and a generous pinch of sugar in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[550ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Trim then cut your green beans in half


### Step 6

Once the plant-based mince has browned, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and cardamom seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your ground turmeric, ground coriander and ground cumin with a very generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1 min further


### Step 7

Add the halved green beans to the pan with the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your Indonesian-style plant-based mince & green bean curry

### Step 8

Serve the Indonesian-style plant-based mince & green bean curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
