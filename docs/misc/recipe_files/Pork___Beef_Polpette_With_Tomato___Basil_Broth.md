## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Pick your basil leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely


### Step 2

Combine your pork & beef mince with the chopped basil stalks (save the leaves for later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix until combined (clean hands is the best way), then roll into 3 meatballs per person


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 4 min, turning occasionally with tongs until browned on all sides

Once browned, set aside on a plate (reserve the pan) – these are your pork & beef polpette


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until softened

Add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min


### Step 5

Add your chopped tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, dried basil, beef stock mix, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water

Stir until combined, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add your giant couscous and cook for 5 min or until beginning to soften – this is your tomato & basil broth


### Step 6

Chop the basil leaves roughly (save some for garnish!)

Grate your Italian hard cheese


### Step 7

Add the pork & beef polpette to the tomato & basil broth and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Remove the pan from the heat and stir the chopped basil through

Serve the tomato & basil broth in a bowl topped with the pork & beef polpette

Garnish with the reserved basil leaves and sprinkle with the grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
