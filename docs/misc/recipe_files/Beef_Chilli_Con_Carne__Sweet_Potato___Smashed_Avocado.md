### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pierce your sweet potato[es] with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 5-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the softened sweet potato to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the skin is crispy

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once the onion is starting to soften, add your beef mince to the pan with the chopped garlic and cook for 4 min further, or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go
