### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Trim the green stalk off your graffiti aubergine[s] and cut lengthways into 3 wedges per person

Add the aubergine wedges to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

### Step 2

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min or until lightly browned

While the aubergine is in the oven, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and grate your garlic

### Step 3

Tear your ciabatta into bite-size pieces

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with your grated garlic, vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[140ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[180ml] </span>boiled water and stir to combine – this is your crouton marinade

### Step 4

Press the torn ciabatta into the marinade until all the sauce soaks into the bread – these are your tomatoey croutons

Add the tomatoey croutons to a separate baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 5

After the initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the sliced pepper to the other side with a small drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt

Push the aubergine closer together and tear your 'Nduja over the top (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Return the tray to the oven along with the tomatoey croutons for 18-20 min or until the pepper is charred and the croutons are crispy around the edges

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grind the chopped basil with a small pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add your red wine vinegar with a pinch of sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with salt, olive oil and vinegar

### Step 7

Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate any remaining Italian hard cheese and add it to the basil oil

Wash your salad, then pat it dry wit kitchen paper

Remove the tray with the aubergine from the oven and break the 'Nduja up with a spatula, then mix through the aubergine wedges until they are coated in the spicy oil – this is your 'Nduja graffiti aubergine

### Step 8

Serve the 'Nduja graffiti aubergine and roasted pepper over the salad

Top with the tomatoey croutons and cheese shavings

Spoon over the crispy 'Nduja and drizzle over the basil oil

Enjoy!
