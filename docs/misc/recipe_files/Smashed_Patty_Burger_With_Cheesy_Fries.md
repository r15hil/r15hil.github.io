### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised – this is your caramelised onion

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper, remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside, then cut the inner core into wedges

Grate your cheddar cheese and combine with your cornflour and a pinch of salt in a pot and mix until the cheese is fully coated

Add your mustard ketchup and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk to the pot and set aside for later – this is your cheese sauce base

### Step 4

Combine your beef mince and ground smoked paprika in a bowl with your Henderson's Relish and a pinch of salt

Mix until combined, then equally divide and shape into 2 meatballs per person

Cover the meatballs with a sheet of baking paper and roll them out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your patties

### Step 5

Once the onion is caramelised, transfer it to a plate (reserve the pan!) and set aside until serving

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties, press them down very firmly with a spatula and cook for 2-3 min on each side, pressing down continuously, or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your smashed patties

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1677853058896-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] with the fries from the oven and add the brioche halves (cut side up!) on top of the fries

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1677853074029-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the smashed patties are cooked through, set aside to rest until serving

Heat the pot with the cheese sauce base over a medium heat

Cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and thickened – this is your cheese sauce

### Step 8

To build the burger, top the warmed brioche base with your tomato ketchup, a outer lettuce leaf, 2 smashed patties, a dollop of cheese sauce, the caramelised onion and the warmed brioche lid – this is your smashed patty burger

Serve the lettuce wedges and fries to the side, drizzle over the remaining cheese sauce and top with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
