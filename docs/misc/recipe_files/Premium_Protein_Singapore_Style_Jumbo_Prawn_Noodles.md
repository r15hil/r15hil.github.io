### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Trim, then chop your spring onion whites into batons and set the spring onion greens aside for later

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half (chop in one bunch for speed!)

Once the pan is hot, add your ginger & garlic paste, spring onion batons, halved Tenderstem broccoli and pepper strips with a generous splash of boiled water

Add your soy sauce and curry powder and cook, covered, for 2 min or until the vegetables are starting to soften

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover with boiled water until fully submerged, stirring to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, or until softened

### Step 5

While the noodles are soaking, finely slice your red chilli[es]

Slice the reserved spring onion greens finely

### Step 6

Once the vegetables have started to soften, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan

Cook, covered, for 6-7 min further or until the vegetables are tender with a bite and the jumbo prawns are cooked through

### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, drain the softened noodles, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water

Add the drained noodles to the pan with your toasted sesame oil and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> reserved starchy noodle water

Stir it all together until well coated – these are your Singapore-style jumbo prawn noodles

### Step 8

Serve the Singapore-style jumbo prawn noodles

Garnish with the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and sliced spring onion greens

Enjoy!
