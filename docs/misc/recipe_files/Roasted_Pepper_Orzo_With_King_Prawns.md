## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut them into strips

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add the pepper strips, onion wedges and chopped tomatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and beginning to colour – these are your roasted vegetables


### Step 3

While the vegetables are in the oven, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add your orzo and tomato paste and cook for 1 min further


### Step 5

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 10 min or until the orzo is beginning to soften

After 10 min, drain, then add your king prawns, then increase the heat to medium and cook for a remaining 4-5 min or until the orzo is tender and the prawns are cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to prevent it from sticking!


### Step 6

While the orzo is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish)


### Step 7

Once the orzo is cooked, add the roasted vegetables to the pan with your red wine vinegar

Add the chopped basil and stir it all together — this is your roasted pepper orzo with king prawns

Tip: Add a splash of water if your orzo is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the roasted pepper orzo with king prawns

Garnish with the reserved basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil, then season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
