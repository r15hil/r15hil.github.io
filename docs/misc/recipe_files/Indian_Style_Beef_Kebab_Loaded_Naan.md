## Ingredients

- Garam masala (1tbsp)
- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Red onion
- Garam masala (1tsp) x0
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Plain naan (2pcs)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Gem lettuce
- Tomato
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and grate half of your red onion[s]

Finely dice the remaining onion


### Step 3

Add your beef mince to a bowl with the grated onion, your garam masala, ginger & garlic paste and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 1 sausage shaped kebab per person – this is your spiced kebab[s]

Tip: Wet your hands to stop the mince sticking to them!


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the spiced kebab[s] and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6-7 min then remove the lid

Cook, uncovered, for 2-3 min or until the kebabs are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel lengths from the outside of your cucumber with a peeler until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Dice the inner stem[s] of the cucumber

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Combine the cucumber ribbons, chopped mint and your natural yoghurt in a bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your cucumber raita


### Step 6

Dice your tomato[es] roughly

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Combine the diced tomato, diced cucumber, diced red onion and chopped coriander in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your kachumber salad

Put your naan[s] in the oven for 3 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

To build, spread the cucumber raita on a warmed naan, then top with a spiced beef kebab, some kachumber salad and a dollop of your mango chutney – this is your Indian-style beef kebab loaded naan

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style beef kebab loaded naan with the chips, remaining kachumber salad and shredded lettuce to the side

Tip: Fold up the sides of the naan and eat it like a hot dog

Napkins at the ready, it's about to get messy!

Enjoy!
