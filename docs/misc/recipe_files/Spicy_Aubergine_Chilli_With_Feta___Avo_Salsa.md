## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cut in half lengthways, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the scored aubergine and cook for 3 min on each side


### Step 3

Whilst the aubergine is browning, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 4

Once the aubergine has browned, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and a pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs

Add the chipotle stock, drained black beans and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and bring to the boil

Cook, covered, for a further 8-10 min or until the aubergine is cooked through and the sauce has thickened


### Step 5

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Crumble your feta into large pieces using your hands

Cut your lime[s] in half


### Step 6

Combine the diced avocado, sliced spring onion and crumbled feta in a small bowl

Add the juice of half the lime and stir it all together – this is your feta & avo salsa

Cut the remaining lime into wedges


### Step 7

Once the aubergine is cooked, shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy aubergine chilli

### Step 8

Serve the spicy aubergine chilli with the brown rice and feta & avo salsa to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
