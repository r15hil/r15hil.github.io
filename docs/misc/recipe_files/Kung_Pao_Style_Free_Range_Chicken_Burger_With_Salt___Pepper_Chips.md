## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with the five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your salt & pepper chips


### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your orange in half


### Step 3

Combine the chopped garlic in a large bowl with the chopped ginger, the juice of half your orange[s] and your soy sauce

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your chicken thighs to the bowl and mix everything together – this is your marinated chicken


### Step 4

Crush your roasted peanuts in the bag with a rolling pin

Add your cornflour and crushed peanuts to the marinated chicken

Give it a good mix up until the chicken is well coated


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden

Transfer the chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Kung Pao-style chicken


### Step 6

Top, tail, and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel and chop your orange[s] into small pieces, discard the peel

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with the shredded lettuce, orange pieces, mayo and a pinch of salt then mix well – this is your zingy slaw


### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to the chip tray, and return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

To build, pile a spoonful of zingy carrot onto each warmed brioche base, then add the Kung Pao-style chicken and top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your Kung Pao-style chicken burger

Serve the salt & pepper chips and remaining zingy slaw to the side

Garnish the chips with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
