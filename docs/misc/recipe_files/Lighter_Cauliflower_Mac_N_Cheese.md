## Description

Low carb comfort doesn't get much better than this. You'll add blitzed cauliflower to a lighter creamy sauce, and cook florets with the pasta for extra veg. Once that's done, you'll smother it all in cheese and bake until golden.

## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 1 pot of soft cheese (50g)
- 1 vegetable stock mix sachet (11g)
- 1 pot of Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1 cauliflower
- 100g conchiglie
- 50g rocket
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Add the conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for an initial 4-5 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the cauliflower stalk<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop the cauliflower head<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small florets

Add 200g <span class="text-danger">[400g]</span> of cauliflower florets (you’ll use the rest later!) to the pot with the conchiglie and cook for a further 4-5 min or until everything is cooked through and tender

Once done, drain and set aside in the colander

Reserve the pot for later


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Dissolve the veg stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Add the veg stock with 200g<span class="text-danger"> [400g] </span>of the reserved<span class="text-danger"> </span>cauliflower stalks and florets to the pot and cook for 8-10 min until softened

Tip: Roast any remaining cauliflower with some spices for a tasty snack!


### Step 5

Once softened, remove the pot from heat and add the soft cheese, Dijon mustard and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your cauliflower mixture

Blitz the cauliflower mixture with a (stick) blender until smooth – this is your cauliflower sauce

Tip: Alternatively, transfer everything to a food processor and blitz!


### Step 6

Return the drained pasta & cauliflower to the pot with the cauliflower sauce and give everything a good mix up

Transfer to an oven-proof dish and top with grated Italian hard cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden


### Step 7

Chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add it to a large bowl

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinegar to the rocket and gently mix together – this is your balsamic dressed salad

### Step 8

Leave the cauliflower mac 'n' cheese to stand for 5 min before serving

Serve the cauliflower mac 'n' cheese with the balsamic dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
