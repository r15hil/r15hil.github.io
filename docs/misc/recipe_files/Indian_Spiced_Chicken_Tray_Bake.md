### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger, then add to a large bowl with your curry powder, half your cultured coconut (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your chicken thighs and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated in the marinade, then refrigerate until later

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onions into wedges

Crush your garlic with the side of a knife, keeping the skins on

### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes, onion wedges and crushed garlic to a large roasting tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Sprinkle over your ground turmeric and yellow mustard seeds

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together

### Step 4

Cut half your lemon[s] into wedges

Add the juice of half the lemon wedges to the potatoes, then add the squeezed wedges to the tray[s] (save the rest for garnish)

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person

### Step 5

Add the crushed garlic to the tray[s], along with the marinated chicken and any remaining marinade from the bowl with the chicken

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 30 min

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once everything’s been cooking for 30 min, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the tray[s] from the oven, push the chicken to one side of the tray and add the spinach

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indian-spiced chicken

### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice your red chilli[es] finely

Once everything's cooked, remove the Indian-spiced chicken from the tray[s] and stir the wilted spinach through the potatoes and onion wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-spiced chicken with the potatoes, spinach & onion wedges to the side

Dollop with the remaining cultured coconut

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) nigella seeds and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
