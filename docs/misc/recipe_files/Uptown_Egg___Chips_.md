## Ingredients

- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 1 white wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 300g potatoes
- 250g cherry tomatoes 
- 10g parsley
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves
- 4 British free-range eggs 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips


Add the chips to a baking tray with 1-2 tbsp olive oil, then season&nbsp;with salt and pepper and oven roast for 30 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Chop the parsley finely (reserving a few leaves for garnish)


Cube approx. 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter and add to a mixing bowl with the garlic, parsley, salt and pepper


Mix and mash the butter thoroughly with a fork &ndash; this is your garlic butter


### Step 3

Remove and discard&nbsp;the stalks from the portobello mushrooms


Divide the garlic butter between the mushrooms inside the caps


Place the mushrooms on a separate baking tray and set aside


### Step 4

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


Peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Add the cherry tomatoes and chopped shallot to a sheet of tin foil


Drizzle with the white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar and season with salt and pepper


### Step 5

Scrunch the foil into a sealed package (see photo) and add to the baking tray with the mushrooms


Put it in the oven for 15 min until the mushrooms are tender and the cherry tomatoes have softened slightly


### Step 6

Remove the tomato package from the oven (leaving the mushrooms in for a further 10 min)


Transfer the cherry tomatoes to a small pan


Heat gently over a medium-high heat until they break down into a warm relish (and most of the liquid has absorbed)


### Step 7

Heat a pan large enough to fit 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>&nbsp;eggs with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil (you will need a lid)


Crack the eggs into a bowl (one at a time) but do not beat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the eggs in one go


Add&nbsp;a lid and cook over a medium-low heat for 3 min or until the whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny&nbsp;

### Step 8

Remove&nbsp;the eggs from the heat and season with salt and pepper


Serve the warm tomato relish, garlic herby mushrooms, chips and eggs together with the reserved parsley leaves scattered over


Enjoy!
