## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Red onion
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Balsamic sun-dried tomato paste (30g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Green chilli
- Parsley (5g)
- Red pepper
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender, then drain and set aside to steam dry


### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Squeeze your sausage meat from the skins into the pan (clean hands is the best way!) and discard the skins

Break the sausage meat up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon, add the sliced onion and cook for 5-7 min or until the sausage meat has browned and the onion has softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the chopped parsley and chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), your white wine vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herby chilli dressing


### Step 6

Once the sausage meat has browned, add the diced pepper to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the drained potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-6 min or until golden and the sausage meat has cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are golden, add the remaining chopped garlic with your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste, blanched peas and a grind of black pepper

Cook for a further 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your sausage, pepper & potato hash

### Step 8

Serve the sausage, pepper & potato hash with the herby chilli dressing drizzled all over

Enjoy!
