## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, boil a kettle, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

While the steak is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest, reserve the pan

Dissolve your pho broth base and beef stock mix in 600ml<span class="text-purple"> [750ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water – this is your pho stock


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 5

While the onion is softening, cut your lime[s] in half

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into matchsticks

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Slice your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained noodles to the pan with the pho stock, fish sauce, tamari soy sauce, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are completely tender


### Step 7

Once tender, remove the pan from the heat and add the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your pho

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the pho in bowls topped with the sliced steak, carrot matchsticks, chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped coriander and mint leaves

Garnish with a lime wedge – this is your fiery Vietnamese-style steak pho

Enjoy!
