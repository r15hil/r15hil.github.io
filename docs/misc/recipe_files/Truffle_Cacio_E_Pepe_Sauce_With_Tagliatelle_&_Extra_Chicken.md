### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, crumble in your chestnut mushrooms using your hands with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Once the mushrooms are beginning to soften, add your cracked black pepper and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further

### Step 6

Once melted, add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water to the sauce and give everything a good mix up

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!)

Add the drained tagliatelle to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the tagliatelle is coated in the sauce – this is your cacio e pepe sauce with fresh tagliatelle

### Step 8

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice finely

Serve the cacio e pepe sauce with fresh tagliatelle and drizzle over your truffle oil

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
