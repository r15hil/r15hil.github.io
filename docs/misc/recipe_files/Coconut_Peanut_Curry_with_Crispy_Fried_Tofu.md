### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your shallot[s] into wedges

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut the tofu into strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the tofu strips and garam masala to the pan and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil
