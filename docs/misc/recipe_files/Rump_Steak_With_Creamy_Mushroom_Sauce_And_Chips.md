- British rump pavé steak (300g)

- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Chestnut mushrooms (160g)
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g) x0
- White potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your potato[es] (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once very hot, add the steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Slice your chestnut mushrooms


### Step 4

Once the steak[s] is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest and reserve the pan

Carefully wipe out the pan with kitchen paper to remove any excess fat


### Step 5

Whilst the steak is resting, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and browned

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [180ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have browned, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min

Add your chicken stock and soft cheese and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

Add the wilted spinach and a generous grind of black pepper to the pan with the mushrooms and stir it all together – this is your creamy mushroom sauce

### Step 8

Serve the rested rump steak with the creamy mushroom sauce and chips to the side

Enjoy!
