## Ingredients

- 80g trimmed fine green beans
- 1 toasted sesame seed sachet (5g)
- 1 green chilli
- 2 carrots
- 3 cardamom pods
- 1 black sesame seed sachet (5g)
- 1 Knorr chicken stock cube
- 320g British chicken thighs
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 20g coriander
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Peel the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and cut into wedges

Cut the waxy potatoes into quarters and chop the carrots into batons (skins on)

Dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 2

Add the vegetables to a deep baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Season with a crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 3

Add the chicken thighs to the tray and season them with a pinch of salt

Drizzle over a little olive oil and cover the chicken with the nigella seeds


### Step 4

Pour the chicken stock into the tray so that the base is covered, then cover the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with tin foil and put it in the oven for 20 min


### Step 5

While the chicken is in the oven, peel and roughly chop the garlic

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 6

Discard the outer green pods and add the cardamom seeds to a pestle & mortar (or food processor!) with the cumin seeds and grind into a coarse powder

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and coriander with a pinch salt and grind to a paste

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a splash of water and stir it all together – this is your zhoug


### Step 7

Remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>from the oven and remove the tin foil

Cover the chicken in the black & white sesame seeds and lay the green beans on top

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to the oven for a final 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are golden

### Step 8

Serve the nigella chicken & roasted vegetables with the zhoug drizzled over the top

Enjoy!
