### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the chopped paneer to the pan and cook for 3 min, turning once halfway until beginning to turn golden

### Step 3

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!

### Step 6

Add your curry powder and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the paneer and cook for 10 secs

Add your tomato paste and tomato wedges and cook for 1 min further, stirring until fully combined

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then add it to the pan with a small splash of cold water and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until wilted

Once wilted, remove the pan from the heat and stir your natural yoghurt through the sauce â€“ this is your chilli paneer masala

### Step 8

Serve the chilli paneer masala with the brown rice and a warmed garlic & coriander naan to the side

Enjoy!
