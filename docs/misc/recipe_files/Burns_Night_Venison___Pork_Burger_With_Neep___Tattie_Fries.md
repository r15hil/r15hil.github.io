### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Peel the swede

Cut the potatoes (skins on) and the peeled swede into skinny fries

### Step 2

Add the skinny fries to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden – these are your neep & tattie fries

### Step 3

While the fries are in the oven, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for 15 min or until caramelised

Tip: Add a splash of water to the pan if they look like they may burn!

### Step 4

Meanwhile, slice 3 <span class="text-danger">[6]</span> cornichons in half lengthways and set aside (these will be going in your burger later!)

Chop the remaining cornichons in half lengthways, then slice them as finely as you can

Combine the sliced cornichon, mayo and wholegrain mustard with a generous pinch of pepper – this is your mustardy cornichon sauce

### Step 5

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Add the venison & pork burger patties to one side of the baking tray

Once the neep & tattie fries have been cooking for 15 min put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

After the onions have been slowly caramelising for 15 min, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>brown sugar and a splash of cold water and cook for a further 3-4 min

Then remove from the heat and set aside

Slice the cheddar cheese into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> slices

### Step 7

Slice the brioche buns in half

Remove the baking tray with the venison & pork burgers from the oven and top with the sliced cheese

Add the sliced brioche buns to the other side of the baking tray and return it to the oven for 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is lightly toasted

### Step 8

Spread the toasted brioche base with half the mustardy cornichon sauce, then layer on the cheesy Burns venison & pork burger, the sweet caramelised onions and sliced cornichon and top with the toasted brioche lid

Serve the neep & tattie fries with the remaining mustardy cornichon sauce to the side

Enjoy!
