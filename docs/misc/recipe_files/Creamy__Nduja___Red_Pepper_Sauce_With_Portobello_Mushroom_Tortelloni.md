### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic and 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, or until fragrant

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and add your soft cheese with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water and mix it all together

### Step 7

Add the drained tortelloni to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy ‘Nduja & red pepper sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Tip: Add an extra splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy ‘Nduja & red pepper sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
