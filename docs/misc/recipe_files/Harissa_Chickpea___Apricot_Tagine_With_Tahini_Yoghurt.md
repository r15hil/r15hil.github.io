## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, keeping the whites and greens separate


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice


### Step 4

Once the pan is hot, add the sliced spring onion whites, diced pepper, baharat, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), roasted garlic paste and a pinch of salt

Cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant and the pepper has softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve half your vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof bowl

Add your couscous and a generous drizzle of olive oil, then stir, cover and set aside

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the drained chickpeas, remaining vegetable stock mix, your diced apricots, chopped tomatoes and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [175ml]</span> boiled water to the pan

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chickpeas have warmed through – this is your harissa chickpea & apricot tagine


### Step 7

While the tagine is cooking, add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with the tahini

Add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>water to loosen and season with a pinch of salt – this is your tahini yoghurt

Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the harissa chickpea & apricot tagine over the couscous

Garnish with your flaked almonds, spring onion greens and tahini yoghurt

Enjoy!
