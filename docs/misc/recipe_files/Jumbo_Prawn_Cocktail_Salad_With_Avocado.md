### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes

Add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, drain your jumbo king prawns then add them to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until cooked through

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool

### Step 3

While the prawns are cooking, combine your tomato ketchup, mayo and Henderson's Relish in a bowl

Add a squeeze of lemon juice, a generous pinch of salt and half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Stir it all together – this is your Marie Rose-style sauce

### Step 4

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and remove 4 outer leaves per person and set aside

Shred the inner core[s]

### Step 6

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways

### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Divide the lettuce leaves evenly

Top with the dressed shredded lettuce, crispy potatoes, avocado slices and cooked jumbo prawns

Drizzle over the remaining Marie Rose-style sauce, sprinkle with the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Only use a little!) and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!
