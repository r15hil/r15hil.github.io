- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Jumbo king prawns (212g)

- Coriander (5g)
- Spring onion x3

- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened and browned


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds (set these aside for garnish), then cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Trim, then chop your spring onions into batons (chop them in one bunch for speed!)

Top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 5

Once fragrant, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan with the spring onion batons and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are almost cooked through


### Step 6

Whilst the prawns are cooking, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your mirin, sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), cornflour and 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water

Give it all a good mix up – this is your spicy soy sauce


### Step 7

Once the prawns are almost cooked, add your udon noodles, carrot ribbons and spicy soy sauce to the pan

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and everything is fully coated in the sauce – this is your spicy jumbo prawn udon stir-fry

### Step 8

To serve, tear your coriander leaves over the spicy jumbo prawn udon stir-fry and sprinkle over the shichimi togarashi

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
