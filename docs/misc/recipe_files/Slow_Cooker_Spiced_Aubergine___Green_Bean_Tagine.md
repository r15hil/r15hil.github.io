## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your slow cooker and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Turn on your slow cooker to high


### Step 3

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skins

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 4

Add the chopped aubergine, red onion wedges and crushed garlic to the dish with the ras el hanout, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your chopped tomatoes to the dish with your sultanas, tahini, the juice of half the lemon and a pinch of salt and sugar

Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix with 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>boiled water, give everything a good mix up and cook for an initial 2 hours


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then chop your green beans in half

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Bash your hazelnuts in the bag with a rolling pin


### Step 6

After the initial 2 hours, add the chopped green beans to the dish and cook for a final 1.5 hours – this is your slow cooker spiced aubergine & green bean tagine


### Step 7

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Serve the slow cooker spiced aubergine & green bean tagine in the middle of the table with the cooked rice and lemon wedge to the side

Garnish with the crushed hazelnuts and chopped parsley
