### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries, then add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with your toasted sesame seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp
