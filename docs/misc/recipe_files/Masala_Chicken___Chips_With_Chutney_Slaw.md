### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined tray (or two) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 22-25 min or until golden and crisp
