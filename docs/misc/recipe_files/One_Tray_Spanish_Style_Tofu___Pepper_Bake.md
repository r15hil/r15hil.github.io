## Ingredients

- Pitted black olives (60g)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- Plain tofu (280g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Spinach (80g)

- Soy sauce (8ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the tofu lengthways into 2 slices per person and score a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through each slice (be careful not to cut all the way through!)


### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Combine your tomato paste and soy sauce with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and stir it all together – this is your marinade


### Step 4

Add the sliced tofu to the marinade and give it a good mix, then transfer to a baking tray (or two!), keeping the remaining marinade in the bowl (you'll use this later!)


### Step 5

Add the chopped potatoes, chopped pepper and olives to the remaining marinade and give everything a good mix up – these are your marinated vegetables

Transfer the marinated vegetables to the baking tray[s] with the tofu and reserve the bowl

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through and starting to char


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wipe the reserved bowl clean with kitchen paper

Combine your mayo, remaining garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), remaining red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt in the reserved bowl – this is your aioli


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once your marinated vegetables are cooked through and charred, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the spinach to the baking tray[s] and return to the oven for a final 1-2 min, or until wilted – this is your one tray Spanish-style tofu & pepper bake

### Step 8

Serve the one tray Spanish-style tofu & pepper bake and drizzle with the aioli

Enjoy!
