## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 16g tomato paste
- 1 red chilli
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 15ml rice vinegar	
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 15ml soy sauce
- 130g basmati rice
- 250g British pork mince
- 3g cornflour
- 80g mangetout
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 1 spring onion
- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pork mince and cook for 4-5 min, breaking it into large bite-sized pieces, until browned and starting to crisp and caramelise


### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Chop the mangetout in half

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 4

Dissolve the chicken stock mix and the tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and whisk to combine – this is your stock


### Step 5

Once the pork mince is done, add the chopped pepper and halved mangetout and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped ginger and five-spice mix to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the stock and cook for 2-5 min or until the sauce is glossy and thickened – this is your Chinese-style sweet & sticky pork


### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Finely slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>into rounds

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style sweet & sticky pork over the cooked rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
