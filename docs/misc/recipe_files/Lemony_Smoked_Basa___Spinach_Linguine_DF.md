### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine

### Step 2

While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min

Remove the pan from the heat and leave the garlic to infuse the oil

### Step 4

Return the pan with the garlic oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped basa and cook for 3-5 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

While the basa is cooking, zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Slice the remaining non-zested lemon into wedges

### Step 6

Once the basa is cooked through, add the Chinese rice wine and single soya to the pan and cook for 2 min over a medium-high heat

Wash the spinach, then add it to the pan along with the juice of the zested lemon (reserve the wedges for garnish)

Season very generously with salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach is wilted and you are left with a loose sauce

### Step 7

### Step 8

Serve the lemony smoked basa & spinach linguine in shallow bowls and top with the lemon zest and a generous grind of pepper

Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
