### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

### Step 2

Add the chopped courgette and chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is golden and tender – this is your roasted veg

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and dice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

### Step 5

Dissolve your tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and a pinch of sugar in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the shallot has softened, add your chopped tomatoes, tomato stock and dried oregano to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your herby tomato sauce

Stir it all together – this is your Mediterranean-style veg stew

Return the pot of drained potatoes to a low heat with a large knob of butter, a splash of milk and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then mash until smooth

Top the Mediterranean-style veg stew with the mash, a drizzle of olive oil and the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your Mediterranean-style veg stew with cheesy potato top
