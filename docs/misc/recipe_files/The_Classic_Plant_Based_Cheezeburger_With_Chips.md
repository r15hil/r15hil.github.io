## Ingredients

- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Cheese flavour slices (2pcs)
- Tomato
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- White potato x3
- Tomato ketchup (30ml)
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel your red onion[s] and slice into 2 rounds per person

Mix your Henderson's Relish and onion marmalade in a bowl – this is your onion marinade mix


### Step 3

Once the chips have been cooking for 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, add the red onion rounds to the other side and spoon over the onion marinade mix

Drizzle them with a little olive oil and return the tray[s] to the oven for 20-25 min further or until softened and sticky – these are your sticky onions


### Step 4

Cut 2 thin slices per person from your tomato[es] and set them aside for serving

Chop the remaining tomato roughly

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside until serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Line a separate baking tray with baking paper

Add your meat-free burger patty[ies] to the lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 6

Mix the torn lettuce and roughly chopped tomato together – this is your salad


### Step 7

Once the patty[ies] are cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and top each meat-free burger patty with a cheese flavour slice

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? You may need to use a separate tray!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 8

To build your burger, top the warmed brioche bun base with a squeeze of ketchup, a reserved lettuce leaf, the tomato slices, a cheezy patty, the sticky onions and a warmed brioche bun lid

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
