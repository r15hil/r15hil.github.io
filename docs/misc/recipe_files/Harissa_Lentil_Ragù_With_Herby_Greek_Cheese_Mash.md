### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

### Step 4

Add the sliced courgette to the garlic and onion and cook for 3-4 min or until the courgette has started to soften

Drain and rinse your green lentils

### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and chopped tomatoes and cook for 10 min

Add your drained green lentils and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your harissa lentil ragù

### Step 6

Whilst the ragù is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk

Crumble in half of your Greek cheese and add half of the chopped parsley and mint (you'll use the rest later!)

Mash until smooth – this is your herby Greek cheese mash

### Step 8

Serve the herby Greek cheese mash over the harissa lentil ragù

Crumble over the remaining Greek cheese and sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
