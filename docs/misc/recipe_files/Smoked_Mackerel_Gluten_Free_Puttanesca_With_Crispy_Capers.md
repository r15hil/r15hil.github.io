Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your capers and cook for 5-6 min, stirring frequently, or until crisp

Once crisp, transfer them to a plate, reserving the pan and any remaining oil – these are your crispy capers
