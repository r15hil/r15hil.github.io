### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and lightly browned

### Step 2

While the onion is softening, trim your green beans

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into thin discs

Add the trimmed green beans and carrot discs to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> cold water, a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around the vegetables to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!) and add it to a baking tray, then set aside for later – this is your vegetable parcel

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the diced chicken breast to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned all over

### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span>[300ml] </span>boiled water

Add your sultanas and stir it all together – this is your sultana stock

### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your pie lids

### Step 6

Put the vegetable parcel[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – this is your buttery veg

Once the chicken has browned all over, reduce the heat to medium and add your curry powder with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp] </span>flour

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add the sultana stock and mix it all together

Cook for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

When the pastry is nearly ready, add your mango chutney to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min over a medium heat

Reduce the heat to very low and add your soured cream

Mix it all together and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through (don't let it boil!) – this is your coronation chicken pie mix

### Step 8

Serve the coronation chicken pie topped with a pie lid and the buttery veg to the side

Season with black pepper

Enjoy!
