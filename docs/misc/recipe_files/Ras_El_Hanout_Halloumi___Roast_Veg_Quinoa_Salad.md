## Ingredients

- 1 courgette
- 200g halloumi cheese
- 130g quinoa
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 10g mint
- 1 red pepper
- 1 lemon
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ 375°F/ Gas 5<br /><br />Cut the red onions into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)<br /><br />Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice/cut into thin strips<br /><br />Top, tail and cut the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped vegetables to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt


Give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the vegetables are soft and slightly brown


Once cooked, carefully cut off the root and remove the skins from the cooked onions


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid, with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water, a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender


### Step 4

While the quinoa is cooking, combine the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon in a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well - this is your lemon dressing


Chop the mint leaves roughly, discarding the stems (save some whole leaves for garnish!)


### Step 5

Slice the halloumi in half, then each half into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12]</span> sticks


Add the halloumi sticks to a plate with the ras el hanout and turn until fully coated in the spices


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the halloumi sticks and cook for 2 min on each side or until golden-brown


This is your ras el hanout halloumi


### Step 7

When the vegetables are done, mix them through the cooked quinoa with most of the lemon dressing and the chopped mint - this is your roast veg quinoa salad


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the ras el hanout halloumi over the roast veg quinoa salad


Drizzle over the remaining lemon dressing and garnish with the reserved mint leaves and a wedge of lemon<br /><br />Enjoy!
