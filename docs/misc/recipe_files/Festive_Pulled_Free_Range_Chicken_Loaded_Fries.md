### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your carrot[s] and potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your root veg fries

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add a pinch of salt to a small bowl with a splash of boiling water and stir until the salt has dissolved

Add your red wine vinegar and your dried cranberries and set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled cranberries

Cut a piece of tin foil, then trim and add your green beans to the middle with a splash cold water and scrunch the edges together to form a sealed parcel

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

### Step 3

Add half of your chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and a knob of butter

Add your dried sage and panko breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up – this is your sage stuffing mix

Add the stuffing mix to one side of a baking paper-lined tray and push it out until approx. the thickness of a pound coin

Add the green bean parcel[s] to the other side of the tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!)

### Step 4

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the stuffing is golden and crisp

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

### Step 5

Whilst the chicken is cooking, dissolve your remaining chicken stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Once the chicken is browned, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>flour and mix well until it's coated the chicken and add the chicken stock

Cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has started to thicken

### Step 6

Meanwhile, drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Once the root veg fries are golden and crispy, push them into 1 pile per person and top with the torn mozzarella

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your festive fries

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1605701255337-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once cooked, cut the sage stuffing into small, bite-sized pieces and drain the quick-pickled cranberries

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the shredded chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Tip: If the gravy hasn't thickened, increase the heat to high and cook for a few min further!

### Step 8

Load up the festive fries with the pulled free range chicken, sage stuffing pieces and quick-pickled cranberries

Serve the green beans to the side

Enjoy!
