## Ingredients

- British slow cooked duck legs (2pcs)
- Orange
- British slow cooked duck leg x0
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Chantenay carrots (160g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Parsley (5g)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Shallot
- Honey (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut narrow slices widthways (about the width of a pound coin) into your waxy potatoes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – these are your hasselback potatoes

Tip: Place chopsticks either side of the potatoes to stop you cutting all the way through!


### Step 2

Separate the white duck fat and the duck jelly from the duck leg[s] and save for later

Add the hasselback potatoes to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with the white duck fat, dried thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 35-40 min or until tender and starting to crisp


### Step 3

Add your duck leg[s] to one side of a separate tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your Chantenay carrots to the other side of the tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!) with a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 28-30 min or until the duck is golden and crispy and the carrots are tende


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest half your orange[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)


### Step 5

Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Whilst the shallot is cooking, dissolve your cornflour in your soy sauce and add your chicken stock mix with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 6

Once the shallot has softened, add the stock to the pot with the juice of the orange[s], the duck jelly, half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-12 min or until thickened

Once thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the orange zest with a knob of butter – this is your orange sauce


### Step 7

Once the duck is golden and the carrots are tender, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Brush some orange sauce over each duck leg and drizzle the remaining honey over the carrots

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 3-4 min or until glazed – this is your duck a l’orange and glazed carrots

### Step 8

Serve the duck a l’orange with the hasselback potatoes and glazed carrots to the side

Drizzle over the orange sauce and garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
