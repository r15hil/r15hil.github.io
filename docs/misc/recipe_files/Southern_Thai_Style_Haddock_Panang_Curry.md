## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 5

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and peanut butter in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Add your ground turmeric, fish sauce, add a squeeze of lime juice and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your peanut stock

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Once the veg has softened, add your red Thai curry paste to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the peanut stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)


### Step 7

Once thickened, top the curry with the haddock bites and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through, then season with a pinch of salt – this is your Southern Thai-style haddock panang curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the Southern Thai-style haddock panang curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
