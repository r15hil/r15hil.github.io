## Description

This cod ain't burnt, it's blackened, Creole-style! That simply means you'll rub it with allspice and paprika, then pan-fry until it has a dark spicy crust. The cherry tomato and lime salsa are chopped up roughly, so it's easy to eat. Messy, zesty & juicy! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes 
- 10g coriander 
- 3 mayonnaise sachets 
- 1 tbsp chipotle paste 
- 1/2 tsp ground allspice
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 2 cod fillets
- 1 spring onion
- 1 lime 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Place the tortilla wraps onto a baking tray&nbsp;


### Step 2

Chop the cherry tomatoes roughly


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Chop the&nbsp;coriander&nbsp;finely including the stalks, reserve a few leaves for garnish &nbsp;


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half&nbsp;


### Step 3

Combine the chopped cherry tomatoes, sliced&nbsp;spring onion and&nbsp;chopped coriander all together on your chopping board


Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and then chop the lot together roughly until you end up with a rough salsa (this makes it easier to eat!)


Add the salsa to a bowl and squeeze the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span>&nbsp;lime&nbsp;over, mix through and set aside&nbsp;


### Step 4

Combine the mayonnaise and chipotle paste&nbsp;(Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a drizzle of olive oil and set aside &ndash; this is your spicy mayo&nbsp;


### Step 5

Combine the smoked paprika and half&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[all]</span>&nbsp;of the ground&nbsp;allspice on a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper


Mix the spices together


Press the cod fillets into the spice mix to&nbsp;coat all over&nbsp;


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the spiced&nbsp;cod fillets and cook for 4 min, flipping once&nbsp;


Don't be alarmed if the cod looks like it's burning, it will become 'blackened', which gives it the smoky, charred flavour you want


### Step 7

Put the tortilla wraps in the oven for 2-3 min, just until they are just warmed through


Cut the remaining lime into wedges


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Divide the salsa and blackened cod between the tortillas and drizzle them with the spicy mayo


Garnish with the remaining lime and the reserved coriander leaves


Get your napkins at the ready and enjoy!
