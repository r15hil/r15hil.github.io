### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 3

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste, dried oregano, chopped garlic, and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your cider vinegar

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your peri peri sauce

### Step 4

Add half of the peri peri sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate large bowl with your chicken thighs and mix well until they're fully coated

Transfer the coated chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!

### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, combine the remaining peri peri sauce with your mayo – this is your perinaise

### Step 6

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skin on) into matchsticks

Trim, then slice the spring onion[s] finely

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1655204425056-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine the grated carrot, apple matchsticks, sliced spring onion and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the perinaise (save the rest for later!) – this is your apple slaw

Slice the peri peri chicken finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced peri peri chicken with the sweet potato chips, apple slaw and the remaining perinaise to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
