### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not the cut the skin

Combine your ground smoked paprika and dried oregano in a small bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky dressing

### Step 2

Transfer the scored aubergine<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side up

Spread the smoky dressing over the cut side of the aubergine

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until the aubergine is cooked through and tender – this is your smoky aubergine

### Step 3

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Whilst the onion is softening, slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Finely chop the remaining green chilli

### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has slightly softened, add the chopped garlic and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your ground turmeric and curry powder to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the diced carrot and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Add the diced pepper, your basmati rice and bay leaf[ves] to the pan with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, gently stir in your blanched peas and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through – this is your West African-style spicy rice

### Step 8

Serve the smoky aubergine over the West African-style spicy rice, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
