## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, dried oregano and chopped garlic, then give everything a good mix up and put in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your garlic French fries


### Step 2

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork and any juices to an oven-proof dish

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min


### Step 3

While the pork is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook for 10-12 min or until golden and softened – this is your caramelised onion & pepper


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s]


### Step 6

After 30 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the BBQ pulled pork apart using two forks

Add your BBQ sauce to the pulled pork and give everything a good mix up –  this is your BBQ pulled pork filling


### Step 7

Divide the BBQ pulled pork filling between the bun[s]

Top with the caramelised onion & pepper and grated cheese, then add to a baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your pulled pork Memphis-style Philly

### Step 8

Serve the pulled pork Memphis-style Philly with the garlic French fries and a dollop of your tomato ketchup to the side
