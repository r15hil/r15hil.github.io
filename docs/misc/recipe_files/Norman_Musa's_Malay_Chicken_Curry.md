## Description

There are so many different curries in Malaysia, all eaten on a daily basis. This particular version lets the spices take centre stage.  Like any good curry, it is a blend of spices, tamarind, and not too overpowering creamy coconut. I like to serve this slightly thicker than is tradition, so that the sauce gives an extra kick.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, place the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water until fully submerged (this softens the naturally hard cream)


Blitz the onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor (or with a hand blender) until fine


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> (4 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil


&nbsp;

### Step 4

Add the blitzed ingredients and cook until softened and lightly golden brown (approx. 3-4 min), then add the star anise, cinnamon and bay leaves and cook for a further 30 seconds&nbsp;


Meanwhile, mix the curry powder with 100ml <span class="text-danger">(200ml)</span> water in a bowl


Tip: Diluting the curry powder prevents it from clumping up whilst frying!

### Step 5

Add the curry powder mixture, tamarind paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> salt (fine sea salt preferably) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, stirring often to prevent sticking to the bottom

### Step 6

Add the chicken, 100ml <span class="text-danger">(200ml)</span> boiled water and the softened coconut cream and reduce the heat to low


Cook until the chicken is cooked through (approx. 7-10 min) and the sauce has thickened

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Fluff the cooked rice with a fork


<span class="text-highlight">Once the chicken is cooked, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> sugar and taste, you may want to add more if needed</span>


Tip: The sugar helps temper the sourness from the tamarind!

### Step 8

Discard the bay leaves and star anise


Stir most of the coriander through the rice, scoop the curry out into bowls and serve with rice


<span class="text-highlight">Garnish with the remaining coriander and enjoy!</span>
