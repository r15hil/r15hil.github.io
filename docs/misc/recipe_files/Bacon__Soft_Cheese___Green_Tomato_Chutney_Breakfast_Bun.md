## Instructions


### Step 1

Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Once done, simply dig in or wrap up ready for your day!


### Step 2

Boil a full kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!

Once crisp, transfer the crispy bacon to kitchen paper and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Slice your tomato[es]


### Step 5

While everything is in the oven, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Drain the spinach and squeeze any excess water out with the back of a spoon (this will stop your brioche bun[s] from going soggy!)


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan[s] to a medium heat

Add your brioche halves, cut-side down, to the pan[s] and cook for 2-3 min or until golden brown


### Step 7

To build, spread the warmed brioche base[s] with your soft cheese

Divide your wilted spinach between the cheesy bases and top with some tomato slices, crispy bacon and your green tomato chutney

Top with the warmed brioche lid[s] – this is your bacon, soft cheese and green tomato chutney breakfast bun

### Step 8

Serve the bacon, soft cheese and green tomato chutney breakfast bun or wrap up to enjoy on-the-go

Time to start your day!
