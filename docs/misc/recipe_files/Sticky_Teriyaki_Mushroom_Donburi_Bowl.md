## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to wash the grains!) and set aside to drain

Add the drained rice, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the rice from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don’t peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with half of your rice vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled slaw

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and garlic

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), then roughly tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for 3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

Dissolve your cornflour in 100ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> [200ml] </span>cold water with your soy sauce, maple syrup and remaining rice vinegar in a small bowl – this is your teriyaki sauce

Once the mushrooms have softened, add the teriyaki sauce and cook for 2 min further, until a glossy sauce coats the mushrooms

Once the mushrooms are done, add them to a bowl and set aside, reserve the pan – these are your sticky teriyaki mushrooms


### Step 6

While the mushrooms are cooking, chop your mangetout in half and trim your spring onion[s] then chop into batons

Slice each spring onion baton into 4 pieces lengthways – this is your shredded spring onion

Add your mangetout to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite


### Step 7

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 8

Stir a pinch of sugar through the sticky rice then serve in a bowl

Top the rice with the fried egg, then surround it with the sticky teriyaki mushrooms, quick-pickled slaw, shredded spring onion and mangetout

Pour over any remaining teriyaki sauce and sprinkle your shichimi togarashi (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) all over

Enjoy!
