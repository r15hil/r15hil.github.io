## Ingredients

- 1 bag of roasted peanuts
- 3 Sriracha hot chilli sauce sachets (24ml)
- 5g black sesame seeds
- 1 green chilli
- 30ml Chinese rice wine
- 30ml soy sauce
- 250g British pork mince
- 20g fried onions
- 2 wholewheat noodle nests
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 150g spring greens
- 3 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 2 tbsp tahini

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely


<span class="text-highlight">Peel and finely chop (or grate)</span> the ginger


Peel and finely chop<span class="text-highlight"> (or grate) t</span>he garlic


### Step 2

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up <span class="text-highlight">and</span> slice into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the pork mince and cook for 5-6 min or until browned and very crispy, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


Once crispy, transfer the crispy pork to a plate and set aside


Reserve the pan


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender


Once tender, drain the noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water


Tip: drizzle over a little vegetable oil to stop the noodles from sticking <span class="text-highlight">together</span>


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


Once hot, add the sliced spring greens with a <span class="text-highlight">pinch of</span> salt and cook for 3-4 min or until wilted


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the tahini to a bowl with the soy sauce, chopped garlic, chopped ginger, <span class="text-highlight">Sriracha hot chilli sauce</span>, chilli flakes (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and<span class="text-highlight"> </span><span class="text-highlight">Chinese rice</span> wine with 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [80ml]</span> of the starchy noodle water


Give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy sesame sauce


Bash the peanuts with a <span class="text-highlight">rolling pin</span> until roughly crushed (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)


### Step 7

Add the drained noodles, crispy pork and spicy sesame sauce to the pan with the wilted spring greens and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy pork &amp; sesame noodles


Tip: add a splash more <span class="text-highlight">starchy noodle water</span> if the sauce is looking a little <span class="text-highlight">dry</span>

### Step 8

Serve the spicy pork &amp; sesame noodles 


Garnish with the sliced green chillies (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!), black sesame seeds, crushed peanuts and <span class="text-highlight">fried</span> onions


Enjoy!
