### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Peel and finely slice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil over a low heat


Once hot, add the onion with a big pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened&nbsp;

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the noodles to a pot of boiling water (enough to cover them) with a big pinch of salt over a high heat


Boil for 3 min or until starting to soften


Meanwhile, trim the green beans and cut them in half

### Step 3

Add the green beans to the same pot as the&nbsp;noodles and cook for a further 3 min


Once cooked, drain and rinse the lot briefly under cold water (to prevent them from sticking together and continuing to cook) before returning them to the pot (off the heat)


Trim the fat off the pork steaks&nbsp;and slice finely into strips

### Step 4

Add the pork strips to the onion pan, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 4 min, then cover with a lid and cook for a further 2 min or until the pork has cooked through


Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and keep covered until later (this stops the pork overcooking)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) the ginger


Trim then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 6

Combine the soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]&nbsp;</span>sugar and half the spring onion in a bowl - this is your chilli mixture

### Step 7

Return the pork&nbsp;to a medium-low heat, remove the lid, and add the chilli mixture


Cook for 1 min, then add the noodles (cut them up in the pan a little for easy eating)


Remove from the heat and add the remaining spring onion

### Step 8

Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper if needed and serve


Enjoy!
