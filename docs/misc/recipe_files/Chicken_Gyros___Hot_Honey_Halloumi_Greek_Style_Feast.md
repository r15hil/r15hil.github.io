### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potato[es] (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up

### Step 2

Peel and grate your garlic

Add your chicken thighs to a bowl with half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!), dried oregano, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Add the marinated chicken to the other side of the baking tray[s] and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the chips are golden and crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced red onion[s] to a small bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion

Cut 2 slices per person from the tomato[es]

Chop the remaining tomato finely

### Step 4

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice half the cucumber finely, and grate the remaining cucumber 

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems, then combine the grated cucumber with your natural yoghurt, remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), chopped mint and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your tzatziki

### Step 5

Slice your halloumi into 4 sticks per person

Add the halloumi sticks to a plate with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and turn several times until fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crispy – these are your halloumi fries

### Step 6

Add your honey and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small bowl and stir it all together – this is your hot honey

Add your pizza base[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1688115334356-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice into strips

To build your gyros, spread a dollop of tzatziki on the warmed pizza base and top with the tomato rounds, chips, sliced chicken and some of the quick-pickled onion – this is your chicken gyros

Add the sliced cucumber and chopped tomato to the remaining quick-pickled onion and toss – this is your Greek-style salad

### Step 8

Serve your chicken gyros with the halloumi fries, Greek-style salad and remaining tzatziki to the side

Drizzle the hot honey over the halloumi fries

Enjoy!
