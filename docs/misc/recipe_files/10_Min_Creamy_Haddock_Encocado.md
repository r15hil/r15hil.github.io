### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and chop it roughly

Dissolve the chopped coconut cream in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes with the ground cumin, smoked paprika, dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs

### Step 4

Add the tomato paste, coconut stock, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 5

Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>(just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 6

Add the haddock bites to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until they're cooked through – this is your haddock encocado

Note: Please make sure you cook your fish thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 7

Pick the coriander leaves from their stalks

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Once done, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the haddock encocado with the steamed basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the coriander leaves and lime wedges

Enjoy!
