### Step 1

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and add them to a pot with a lid with your basmati rice, 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice 1/3 of your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the rest

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, ginger & garlic paste and a generous pinch of salt in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add your garam masala to the pan with your curry powder, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and ground turmeric

Stir it all together and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1681316892990-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce is slightly thickened

Once slightly thickened, add the chopped green beans and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the beans are almost tender

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1681316896753-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the beans are almost tender, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your spicy king prawn madras curry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy king prawn madras curry over the cardamom rice

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a grind of black pepper

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!
