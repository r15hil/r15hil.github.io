### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into fries

Add the fries to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the fries are tender and starting to crisp

### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!), ginger & garlic paste, curry powder, ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the pork mixture<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape into 2 oval patties per person

### Step 4

Add the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced shallot and a pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind to a paste

Add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] – this is your spicy sambal

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Use a food processor instead!

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chilled patties and cook for 5 min on each side or until browned on both sides and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Sri-Lankan-style pork patties

### Step 6

While the patties are cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine your natural yoghurt and chopped coriander in a large bowl with the juice of the remaining lime and a pinch of salt – this is your raita-style dressing
