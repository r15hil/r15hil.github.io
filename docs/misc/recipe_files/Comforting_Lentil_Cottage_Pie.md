## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 16g tomato paste 
- 1 cooked black beluga lentils
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 vegetable stock mix
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 8g Marmite
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 broccoli
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Top, tail, and dice your carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, diced carrot and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your Marmite – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the vegetables have softened, add the beluga lentils and the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a grind of black pepper and a pinch of salt, then cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened – this is your lentil mixture

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 5

While the lentil mixture thickens, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a large knob of butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth


### Step 6

Once the lentil mixture has thickened, transfer it to an oven-proof dish

Top with the mashed potato and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your lentil cottage pie


### Step 7

While your cottage pie is cooking, reboil a kettle

Cut your broccoli into florets

Add the broccoli florets to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the lentil cottage pie with the broccoli to the side and enjoy!
