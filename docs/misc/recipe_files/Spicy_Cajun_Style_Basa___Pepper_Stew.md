### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin, ground coriander, ground smoked paprika and dried oregano

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes have begun to break down

Boil a kettle

### Step 4

While the tomatoes are softening, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough bite-sized pieces

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1649172070092-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the tomatoes have softened, add the chopped pepper to the pan with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour and stir everything together

Add the tomato stock to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style stew base

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1649172078783-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Lay your basa fillet[s] over the Cajun-style stew base, spooning over some of the sauce so they are submerged

Cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the fish is cooked through and the pepper is tender with a bite – this is your spicy Cajun-style basa & pepper stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the spicy Cajun-style basa & pepper stew with the basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!
