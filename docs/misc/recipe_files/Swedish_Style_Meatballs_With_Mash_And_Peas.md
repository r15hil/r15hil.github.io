- Dijon mustard (5.5g) x0
- British pork mince (125g) x0
- Redcurrant jelly (25g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Blanched peas (160g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with your panko breadcrumbs, half of your chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined, then shape into 6 meatballs per person and reboil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a medium-high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min, turning occasionally, until they are browned all over

Meanwhile, combine the remaining chicken stock mix, Dijon mustard, Henderson’s Relish and redcurrant jelly in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Add your dried cranberries to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium heat, and once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir until a sandy paste forms (if your pan is looking dry add a small knob of butter)

Gradually whisk in the stock and cook for 2-3 min until slightly thickened


### Step 5

While the sauce is thickening, chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to the thickened sauce

Return the meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – these are your Swedish-style meatballs & gravy


### Step 6

Reboil half a kettle

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Drain the cranberries

### Step 8

Serve the Swedish-style meatballs & gravy with the mash and refreshed peas to the side

Garnish with the drained cranberries and remaining chopped dill

Enjoy!
