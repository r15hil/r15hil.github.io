### Step 3

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue&nbsp;to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'

Shred the little gem lettuce

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the chilled meatballs&nbsp;


Cover with a lid and cook for 4-6 min, shaking occasionally so that the meatballs cook evenly

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Chop the roasted&nbsp;peanuts roughly


Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut into wedges&nbsp;

### Step 6

Transfer the cooked meatballs to a plate - leave the cooking juices in the pan&nbsp;


Add the shallot to the pan and cook over a medium heat for 1 min or until warmed through but not softened


Remove the pan from the heat and add the soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar&nbsp;


Squeeze the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span>&nbsp;lime into the pan and mix&nbsp;- this is your shallot&nbsp;dressing


&nbsp;
