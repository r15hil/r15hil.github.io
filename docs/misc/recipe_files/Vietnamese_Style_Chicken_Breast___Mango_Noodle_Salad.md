## Ingredients

- Gem lettuce
- Mango

- Fine egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Coriander & mint (10g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water until fully submerged and stir for 10 sec until the noodles separate

Set aside to soak for 4 min, or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles, run them under cold water for 10 sec until slightly cooled, then set aside to drain further


### Step 4

Whilst the noodles are softening, combine the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, Sriracha hot chilli sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar and soy sauce with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil – this is your dressing


### Step 5

Rip the outer leaves of your lettuce[s] into large, bite-sized pieces then shred the inner core

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them roughly, discarding the stalks

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Chop the mango flesh into small bite-sized pieces, discarding the stones


### Step 7

Add the ripped lettuce, drained noodles, chopped mango and most of the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your noodle salad

Transfer the crispy chicken to a clean board and shred apart into roughly bite-sized pieces using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

### Step 8

Serve the noodle salad topped with the crispy chicken

Garnish with the chopped herbs and remaining chopped chilli (remember to go easy if you don’t like spice)

Enjoy!
