## Description

Weâ€™ve added a twist to this classic cheesy gratin by using grated potatoes rather than sliced. This makes it quicker and binds the potatoes and cheese sauce together. Rich smoked mackerel seasons the dish and adds a savoury depth. Served with a punchy Dijon and white wine vinegar dressed little gem side-salad for balance. Grate stuff!
