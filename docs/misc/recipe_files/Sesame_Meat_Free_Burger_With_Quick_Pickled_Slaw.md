## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 1 brioche style buns
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 2 ultimate vegan burger patties
- 0 rice vinegar
- 8ml Sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
-  30ml rice vinegar 	
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 3

Add your meat-free burger patty[ies], grated ginger and sliced spring onion to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a grind of pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a very good mix up until fully combined – this is your meat-free burger mixture


### Step 4

Divide the meat-free burger mixture equally and shape into 1 patty per person

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds evenly over the burger patty[ies]

Lightly oil a baking tray with vegetable oil and add the sesame meat-free burger patty[ies], put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine half of your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar and salt in a bowl

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the grated carrot and cucumber ribbons to the bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled slaw


### Step 6

Slice the brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You might need to do this in batches!


### Step 7

Combine your mayo and remaining sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Drain the quick-pickled slaw of any excess pickling liquid, discard the liquid

### Step 8

To assemble, spread a toasted brioche base with some sriracha mayo, then top with a sesame meat-free burger patty, quick-pickled slaw and another dollop of sriracha mayo and a toasted brioche lid – this is your sesame meat-free burger

Serve the chips and any remaining quick-pickled slaw to the side and sprinkle over the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
