## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min


### Step 2

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Meanwhile, soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking) and preheat the grill to medium-high


### Step 3

Peel your garlic and your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon)

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin and discard the tough outer layer[s]

Add the garlic, ginger, lemongrass core[s] and lime leaf[ves] to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped – this is your ginger & lemongrass paste

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop everything very finely!


### Step 4

Once blitzed, combine the ginger & lemongrass paste, lean pork mince (remove the paper from the mince if required!) and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl and mix everything together


### Step 5

Divide the lean pork mixture and press it onto each skewer to form 2 long sausage shapes per person – these are your Indonesian-style lean pork skewers

Add the Indonesian-style lean pork skewers to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min, turning once, or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

While the skewers are grilling, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-heat, then trim your green beans, and add them to the hot pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften, then add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until tender with a slight bite

Meanwhile, chop half of your red chilli[es] into rounds, then deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and finely chop the rest


### Step 7

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Combine the remaining soy sauce, with your toasted sesame oil, the juice of your lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>brown sugar, the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced spring onion and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli & lime dressing

### Step 8

Serve the Indonesian-style lean pork skewers over the cooked rice with the fried green beans to the side

Sprinkle your crispy onions over the beans and drizzle the chilli & lime dressing over the skewers and rice

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
