- British lean beef mince (<5% fat) (250g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Yellow mustard seeds (1tsp)
- Tomato ketchup (30ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Red wine vinegar (30ml)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, slice your cucumber[s] in half lengthways, then slice the halves into wedges

Add your red wine vinegar, mustard seeds, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar, a splash of boiled water and a pinch of salt to a bowl and stir until dissolved

Add the cucumber wedges to the bowl and give everything a good mix up, then set aside - these are your quick-pickled cucumber wedges

Tip: Give the cucumber the occasional shake while pickling!


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted, then set them aside until serving (save the pan!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 4

Add your lean beef mince and soy sauce to a large bowl with a generous pinch of pepper

Knead thoroughly until fully combined (kneading the patty[ies] for longer will make them more tender!)

Shape into 1 burger patty per person


### Step 5

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the lean beef burger patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your mayo, tomato ketchup and mustard ketchup in a small bowl – this is your special sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Once cooked, add the grated cheese on top of the lean beef burger patty[ies] and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the cheese is melted – this is your lean beef cheeseburger patty

Drain the quick-pickled cucumber wedges, discard the liquid

### Step 8

To assemble, spread the special sauce onto the toasted brioche base, then top with a lean beef cheeseburger patty, a sprinkling of crispy onions and a toasted brioche lid – this is your American-style lean beef cheeseburger

Serve the potato wedges and quick-pickled cucumber wedges to the side

Enjoy!
