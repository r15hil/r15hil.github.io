## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly

Tip: Slice into rings for speedy chopping!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat


### Step 3

Once very hot, add the beef strips and cook for 1-2 min or until browned all over

Transfer the beef strips to a plate and reserve the pan

Tip: Don't worry if the beef strips aren't fully cooked through yet, they'll go back in the pan later!


### Step 4

Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add the chopped pepper and mangetout and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 6

Add the soy sauce, hoisin sauce and toasted sesame oil to the pan and cook for 1 min further


### Step 7

Add the drained noodles and beef strips, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your beef chow mein

### Step 8

Serve the beef chow mein and garnish with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
