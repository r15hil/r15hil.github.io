### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and golden

### Step 2

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coriander seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the coriander seeds to a pestle & mortar and crush roughly

Reserve the pan

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and the sliced onion

Cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, peanut butter and chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[460ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and crushed coriander seeds to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Increase the heat to medium, add your cherry tomatoes and coconut stock and cook for 7-9 min or until thickened

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!)

Add the roasted butternut squash and chopped coriander to the pan and cook for 1 min further – this is your Brazilian-style squash & coriander curry

Add the juice of half your lime[s] to the curry

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style squash & coriander curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
