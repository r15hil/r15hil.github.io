## Description

In this dish, we're showcasing samphire- a beautiful sea vegetable that grows on beaches. It has a naturally salty flavour and crunchy texture that works beautifully with fish. You'll sprinkle this salmon pasta with a hazelnut 'dukkah', a seasoning made from toasted nuts, sesame seeds and spices for a rich, tasty topping!

## Ingredients

- 2 salmon fillets
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 200g conchiglie
- 50g samphire
- 1 bag of hazelnuts
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp coriander seeds
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle and preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Add the hazelnuts and sesame seeds to a baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until the nuts and seeds have slightly darkened (toasted)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the pasta to a pot of boiling water over a high heat with a big pinch of salt


Bring to the boil and cook for 8-10 min, or until cooked but with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil&nbsp;


Pat the salmon fillets dry with kitchen towel and season on both sides with salt


Once the pan is hot, add the salmon, skin-side down and cook for 3-4 min or until the skin is crispy


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the coriander seeds and cumin seeds to the hazelnuts and put the tray back in the oven for 1 min further (this toasts the spices, which releases their aroma)


Once done, transfer (reserve the tray for the next step!) the toasted hazelnut mixture to a pestle and mortar (or food processor) and set aside to cool


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Transfer&nbsp;the crispy-skinned salmon, skin-side up, to your baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and reserve the pan for later


Put&nbsp;the salmon in the oven for 4-6 min or until the salmon has cooked&nbsp;


Tip:&nbsp;Your fish is done when it is opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, crush (or pulse in a food processor) the cooled nuts and seeds to a sandy, nutty rubble&nbsp;


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your dukkah&nbsp;


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with 40g <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> butter&nbsp;


Once melted, add the samphire with a small splash of water, cover and cook for no more than 1 min (the samphire hardly needs any cooking at all!)


Meanwhile, cut the lemon in half and squeeze half the juice into the drained pasta


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Add the samphire (and all the melted butter) to the pasta and stir through, season with pepper


Serve the pasta in bowls, flake the salmon into it, sprinkle with the dukkah and serve with the remaining lemon (cut into wedges)&nbsp;


Enjoy!
