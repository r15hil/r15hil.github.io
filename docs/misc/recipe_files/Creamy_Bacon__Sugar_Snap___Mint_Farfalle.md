### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy

Once crispy, remove half of the crispy bacon and set it aside until later

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 8 min

Slice your sugar snap peas into thirds

Once the pasta has been cooking for 8 min, add the sliced sugar snaps and cook for 2-3 min further or until the pasta is cooked with a slight bite and the peas are tender

Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of starchy pasta water

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy sauce

### Step 7

Stir the cooked farfalle, sugar snaps, reserved crispy bacon and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) through the creamy sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy bacon & sugar snap farfalle

Tip: If the sauce is looking a little dry add a splash of the starchy pasta water

### Step 8

Serve the creamy bacon & sugar snap farfalle in bowls

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with the chopped mint

Enjoy!
