### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into chunks

### Step 3

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs to the dish with a knob of butter and cook for 3 min or until very lightly browned

### Step 4

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into quarters

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Drain your sweetcorn

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear

### Step 5

Add the chopped red pepper, smoked paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and white long grain rice to the dish

Add 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with your chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Add the drained sweetcorn to a serving bowl with half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!), a squeeze of lime juice and a drizzle of olive oil then crumble over your feta

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your esquites

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1722345273183-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once everything's cooked through, remove the dish from the oven

Shred the cooked chicken apart using two forks and fluff the rice – this is your smoky coriander chicken & rice

### Step 8

To serve, garnish the smoky coriander chicken & rice with the remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Serve the esquites to the side

Dig in!
