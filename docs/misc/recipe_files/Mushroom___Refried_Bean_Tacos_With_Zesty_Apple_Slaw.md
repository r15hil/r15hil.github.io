## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Add your red wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water to a bowl

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s], then add to the bowl and set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled red onions


### Step 2

Drain and rinse your black beans

Heat a pot with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add your ground smoked paprika and cook for 10-20 secs or until fragrant

Add the drained black beans, soy sauce and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and season with salt and pepper

Cook, covered, for 10 min or until the beans are very soft


### Step 3

Meanwhile, finely dice the remaining red onion[s]

Finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!) and juice your lime[s]

Core and slice your apple[s] into matchsticks


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook over a medium heat for 3-4 min or until softened

Tear your flat white mushrooms into rough, bite-sized pieces and add to the pan with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped garlic

Cook, covered, for 5-7 min or until softened


### Step 5

While the mushrooms are cooking, combine the apple matchsticks, lime juice and zest with your mayo – this is your zesty apple slaw


### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the black beans have softened, add a knob of butter to the pot and mash them to a coarse paste – these are your refried beans

Drain the quick-pickled red onions, discard the liquid

### Step 8

Divide the refried beans and mushrooms evenly between the warmed tortillas – these are your mushroom & refried bean tacos

Garnish the tacos with the zesty apple slaw and quick-pickled red onions

Enjoy!
