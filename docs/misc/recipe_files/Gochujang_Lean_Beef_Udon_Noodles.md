### Step 1

Before you begin...

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 4 min or until the beef is beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 6

Once the beef has browned, add the carrot discs to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

While the carrot is softening, add your udon noodles to a bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside for 2 min or until softened, then gently break apart using a fork

### Step 7

Once softened, drain the noodles, then add them to the pan with the spinach and gochujang sauce

Gently stir it all together and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until the noodles are coated in sauce, the spinach has wilted and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your gochujang lean beef udon noodles

### Step 8

Serve the gochujang lean beef udon noodles and garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
