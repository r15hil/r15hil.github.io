## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and cut your sweet potato[es] into fries


### Step 2

Add the sweet potato fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the fries are cooking, cut the chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add your cornflour and a pinch of salt to a bowl

Add the chicken pieces to the cornflour and give everything a good mix up so the chicken pieces are fully coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 4 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> [8 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side, or until nicely golden and crisp

Once done, transfer the golden chicken to a plate covered with kitchen paper and set aside for later


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a pot with 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g] </span>butter on a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your sriracha (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir everything together until it combines and becomes a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce


### Step 6

Chop your chives finely, then peel and grate your garlic

Combine your natural yoghurt, Dijon mustard, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and chopped chives in a bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch dip

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and chop into quarters


### Step 7

Return the buffalo sauce to a medium heat

Once hot, add the golden chicken to the pot and toss until the chicken is fully coated in the sauce – this is your buffalo chicken breast

### Step 8

Serve the buffalo chicken breast with the sweet potato fries, ranch dip and lettuce quarters to the side

Enjoy!
