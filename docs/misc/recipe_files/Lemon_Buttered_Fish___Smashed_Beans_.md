## Description

Zesty lemon-buttered basa is served over warm smashed beans and dill flecked potatoes. Here, we've used two types of beans: runner beans and butter beans. 'Smashed' simply means that instead of mashing until smooth, you'll lightly crush the potatoes which gives a more rustic texture and means less work for your arm. Smashing stuff!

- 1 tsp dried dill
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Zest&nbsp;the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Cut&nbsp;2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>&nbsp;thin slices from the centre of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;(save for garnish)


Reserve&nbsp;the lemon halves for later


### Step 2

Add&nbsp;the fish fillets to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and&nbsp;season them lightly with salt and pepper


Combine&nbsp;the lemon zest in a small bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil


Spread&nbsp;the lemon zest evenly over the fish fillets


Put them in the oven for 10 min or until your fish is cooked through


### Step 3

Heat a pot of boiled water over&nbsp;a high heat


Cut the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>&nbsp;(skins on) into bite-size pieces, add them to the pot, cover and bring to the boil


Cook for 5 min until almost fork-tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the butter beans


Cut the runner beans into bite-size pieces


Add the runner beans&nbsp;to the potato pot and boil a further 5 min


### Step 5

Once the fish is cooked,&nbsp;remove&nbsp;it&nbsp;from the oven


Tip: your fish is cooked when it flakes easily and is opaque


Add a knob of butter to the warm baking tray


Squeeze the remaining lemon halves over the fish


### Step 6

Drain the potatoes and runner beans and&nbsp;return them to the pot with the&nbsp;butter&nbsp;beans


Add the dill, a large knob of butter and season generously with salt and pepper


Smash the beans and potatoes briefly with a potato masher (smashing is a lighter version of mashing and ensures that a course texture is maintained)


### Step 7

Divide the smashed-bean potatoes between each plate


Place the fish over the smashed potatoes


Swirl the baking tray around to combine the lemon and butter that remains


This is your lemon butter

### Step 8

Drizzle the lemon butter over each piece of fish and garnish with the sliced lemon


Enjoy!
