### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins-on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further

Add your pork & beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 4

Whilst the mince is browning, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Once the mince has browned, add the sliced courgette and cook for 3-4 min further or until the courgette has started to soften

### Step 5

Dissolve your beef stock mix and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and your chopped tomatoes and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa pork & beef mince ragù

### Step 6

Whilst the ragù is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk

Crumble in half your Greek cheese and add half the chopped parsley and mint (you'll use the rest later!)

Mash until smooth then taste for seasoning, adding a pinch more salt if needed – this is your herby Greek cheese mash

### Step 8

Serve the herby Greek cheese mash on a plate, make a well in the centre and fill with the harissa pork & beef mince ragù

Crumble over the remaining Greek cheese and sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
