- Raw peeled king prawns (85g) x0
- Raw peeled king prawns (171g)
- Toasted sesame oil (10ml)
- Ginger paste (15g)
- Spring onion x2
- Medium egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- Garlic clove x2
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Hoisin sauce (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into thirds

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion and sliced pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min until they're tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 5

Once the veg has softened, drain, then add your king prawns to the pan with the chopped garlic and ginger paste and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through


### Step 6

Add your toasted sesame oil to the drained noodles and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame noodles


### Step 7

Once the prawns are cooked, reduce the heat to low and add your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, sesame noodles and a splash of water to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are coated in the sauce – this is your Chinese-style king prawn & pepper chow mein

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style king prawn & pepper chow mein

Enjoy!
