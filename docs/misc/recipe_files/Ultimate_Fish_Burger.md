## Description

We've called this fish burger 'ultimate' because, quite simply, it is. Crispy panko-crusted fish, melted mature cheddar, caper mayo sandwiched into a toasted brioche bun and skewered together. Served with crispy wedges and a classic lettuce and tomato side salad. This is the business. The fishy business!

## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar 
- 1 little gem lettuce 
- 1 tomato
- 2 basa fillets
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 
- 30g caper buds 
- 1 British free range egg
- 300g potatoes 
- 2 brioche rolls 
- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 spring onion
- 2 skewers 
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skin on) into wedges


Place them on a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season generously with salt and pepper


Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the fish fillets in half widthways


Tap a few tbsp of flour out onto a plate, then beat the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and pour them into a shallow bowl


Pour the panko breadcrumbs onto a third plate, then coat the fish in flour, then egg and finally breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to coat them evenly and set aside&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Cut the brioche buns in half


Heat a large, wide-based dry pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the buns, cut-side down, and toast them for 3 min or until coloured and charred on one side only


Once charred, remove and set aside until serving and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely


Chop the capers finely


Combine the&nbsp;capers, mayonnaise and&nbsp;white wine vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half the spring onion (save the rest for the next step) - this is your caper mayo


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>


Tear the&nbsp;lettuce up and add it to a salad bowl with the tomatoes and remaining spring onion


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Once the wedges are nearly cooked, return the reserved pan to a high heat with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil&nbsp;


Once very hot, add the breaded&nbsp;fish and cook for 1 min each side until golden&nbsp;


Meanwhile, slice the cheddar&nbsp;in half lengthways&nbsp;


### Step 7

Transfer the crispy fish to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!), season it with salt and add the cheese to half of the fillets


Put the tray in the oven for 4 min or until the cheese has just melted

### Step 8

Assemble your fish burger with a little caper mayo over each brioche base with the cheesy fish atop, and the cheese-less fish over


Secure the top brioche with a skewer&nbsp;


Serve the salad, wedges and remaining mayo to the side


Enjoy!
