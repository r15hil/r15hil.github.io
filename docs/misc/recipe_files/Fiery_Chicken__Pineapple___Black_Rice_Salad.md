## Ingredients

- British chicken breast portion x0
- Gem lettuce
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Ground allspice (1tsp)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Black rice (130g)
- Pineapple slices (220g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Add your black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 30 min or until it's tender (it will still have a slight bite to it when cooked)

Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool slightly


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a dry, large, wide-based pan over a high heat

Once hot, add your pineapple rings (reserve the juice!) and cook for 2-4 min on each side or until browned and caramelised – this is your caramelised pineapple

Transfer to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Cover the chicken breast portions in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and approx. 2cm in thickness


### Step 4

Combine your ground allspice and smoked paprika on a plate with your dried oregano, cayenne pepper (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Season with pepper and a very generous pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your fiery seasoning

Add the flattened chicken to the fiery seasoning and mix until it's fully coated in all the spices – this your coated chicken


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side pressing down firmly with a spatula until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fiery chicken


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then shred it finely


### Step 7

Combine the reserved pineapple juice and your red wine vinegar in a  bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Add the shredded lettuce and the cooked black rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your black rice salad

Slice the fiery chicken into thin strips

### Step 8

Serve the black rice salad topped with the caramelised pineapple and fiery chicken strips

Enjoy!
