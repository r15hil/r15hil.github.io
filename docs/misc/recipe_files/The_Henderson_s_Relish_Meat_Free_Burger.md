### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden and crispy – these are your black pepper chips

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot over a low heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 20 min, stirring frequently, or until halved in size and golden

Tip: Cook the onion over a really low heat so it doesn’t burn!

Once golden, add 3/4 of your Henderson's Relish (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min further or until dark and soft – this is your Henderson's caramelised onion

### Step 3

While the onion is caramelising, combine the remaining Henderson's Relish and your mayo in a small bowl – this is your Henderson's mayo

### Step 5

Line a separate baking tray (or two!) with baking paper

Add your meat-free burger patty[ies] to the lined tray[s] and put in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

### Step 7

Once the patty is cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top your patty[ies] with a cheese flavour slice

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheeze has melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread the Henderson’s mayo onto the warmed brioche halves, then fill with the Henderson’s caramelised onion, a cheezy patty and some shredded lettuce – this is your Henderson’s Relish meat-free burger

Serve with the black pepper chips to the side

Enjoy!
