## Ingredients

- 200g cod bites
- 1 tomato
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 130g white long grain rice
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 185g canned chickpeas
- 1 carrot
- 5g parsley
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid, with a knob of butter over medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has softened

Once softened, add the ras el hanout to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your spiced onion


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, boil half a kettle

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and transfer 1/3 of the spiced onion to a medium-sized pot with a matching lid


### Step 3

Add the white long grain rice to the pot with the spiced onion

Add 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to the pot with the ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) until serving – this is your turmeric rice


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, return the pan with spiced onion to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the tomato paste and grated carrot to the pan with the drained chickpeas and chopped tomato and give everything a good mix up

Season with a small pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until the tomato is starting to break down


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water

Once the tomato has broken down, add the veg stock to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Moroccan-style stew


### Step 6

While the sauce is thickening, pat the cod dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the sauce has thickened, top the stew with the seasoned cod bites and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Moroccan-style cod & chickpea stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Once the rice is cooked, add most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) to the turmeric rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your golden rice

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style cod & chickpea stew with the golden rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
