## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and sliced pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, saffron and tomato paste in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your saffron stock

Once the onion is starting to soften, add 2/3 of the chopped garlic and half of your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the spices


### Step 4

Add the saffron stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 5

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tofu, soy sauce and remaining chopped garlic to a medium bowl with your ground cumin, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and the remaining ground smoked paprika

Season with a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your coated tofu


### Step 6

Once the paella has been cooking for an initial 25 min, add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and gently stir in your blanched peas

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a final 5-6 min or until everything is tender and warmed through – this is your plant-based paella


### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu with a small pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp – this is your crispy tofu 'chorizo'

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based paella and top with the crispy tofu 'chorizo'

Garnish with the chopped parsley and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
