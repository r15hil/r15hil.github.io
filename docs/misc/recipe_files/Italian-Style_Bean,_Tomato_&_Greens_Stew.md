### Step 2

Once hot, add the chopped potato and diced carrot to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly browned

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans

### Step 6

Once the potato is fork-tender, tear half your ciabatta[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces (you'll use the rest later!)

Add the torn ciabatta to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook, uncovered, for a further 5 min or until the bread is fully soaked into the sauce

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir through most of your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice the remaining ciabatta[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half

Add the sliced ciabatta to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once warmed through, spread a knob of butter over the toasted ciabatta, then cut each half into triangles – this is your ciabatta toast

### Step 8

Serve the Italian-style bean, tomato & greens stew with the ciabatta toast on the side

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
