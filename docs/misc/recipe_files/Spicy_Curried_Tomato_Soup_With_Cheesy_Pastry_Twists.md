## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] in half

Add the halved tomato[es] to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20 minutes or until the tomatoes are beginning to caramelise – this is your roasted tomato


### Step 2

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then cut into 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>strips per person

Add the pastry strips to a baking paper-lined baking tray


### Step 3

Top each strip with grated cheese and sprinkle your nigella seeds on top

Twist each pastry strip from the ends in opposite directions until they look like a spiral

Put the tray in the oven and cook the pastry twists for 10-12 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your cheesey twists


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 600ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[900ml] </span>[1.2L]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a large pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste and curry powder and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and tomato stock to the pot, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min

Once done, add the roasted tomato and cultured coconut

Remove the pot from the heat and blitz everything up with a (stick) blender until smooth – this is your spicy curried tomato soup


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the spicy curried tomato soup in a bowl with the cheesy twists to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
