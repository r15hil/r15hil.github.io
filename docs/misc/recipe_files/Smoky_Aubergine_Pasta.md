## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 
- 200g conchiglie
- 10g fresh dill
- 1 tbsp Henderson's relish
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp tahini paste
- 1 aubergine 
- 1/2 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) on a medium heat


Once hot, cook the walnuts for 3 min or until lightly toasted, checking frequently


Meanwhile, cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into 1cm pieces, discarding the green stalk<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Once the walnuts are toasted, set them aside for serving and reserve the pan


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Return the walnut pan to a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil


When hot, add the aubergine with a large pinch of salt


Cook for 5 min until the flesh is a deep golden colour, stirring minimally


Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> for step 3 and boil a kettle for step 4


### Step 3

Transfer the darkened aubergine to a food processor, reserving a handful for garnish


Return the pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil&nbsp;


Once hot, add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min, or until translucent and softened, stirring occasionally


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the pasta to a large pot of boiling water with a large pinch of salt (optional)


Cook on a high heat for 8-10 min, or until cooked but with a slight bite&nbsp;


Reserve 200ml <span class="text-danger">(300ml)</span> of pasta water for step 7 and drain thoroughly for serving


### Step 5

Once the onion is soft, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of sugar, the red wine vinegar, the Henderson's relish and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(4 tbsp)</span> of water


Turn the heat down to the lowest setting and simmer the onions gently for a further 10-15min, or until they're sticky and most of the water is absorbed


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the garlic for step 7


Chop the dill finely (including the stalks)


Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into wedges


Reserve the dill and lemon for serving


### Step 7

Add the tahini, 200ml <span class="text-danger">(300ml)</span> of pasta water and the garlic to the aubergine already in the processor


Tip: Using the starchy pasta water helps to bind the sauce


Blitz everything until you reach the consistency of a chunky dip-this is your baba ganoush

### Step 8

Set aside half of the onions and toss the pasta and baba ganoush through the remaining onions in the pan, and season generously with salt and pepper


Plate and top with the remaining aubergine pieces and onions, toasted walnuts, chopped dill and nigella seeds


Serve with lemon wedges and enjoy!
