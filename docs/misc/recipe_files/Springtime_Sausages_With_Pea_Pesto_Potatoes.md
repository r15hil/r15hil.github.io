## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Proper Porker sausages (3pcs) x0
- Proper Porker sausages (6pcs)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Rocket (20g)
- Flaked almonds (15g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Add your sausages to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

While the sausages are in the oven, add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 17-18 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are fork tender, drain then return them to the pot and crush gently


### Step 3

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Chop your Italian hard cheese into small bite-size pieces

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them


### Step 4

Add the crushed garlic, chopped Italian hard cheese, flaked almonds and half the refreshed peas (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until a coarse paste remains – this is your pea pesto

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!


### Step 5

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a crack of black pepper – this is your dressing


### Step 6

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad


### Step 7

Add a small knob of butter to the crushed potatoes with the pea pesto and remaining refreshed peas and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – these are your pea pesto potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the cooked sausages over the pea pesto potatoes

Top with the dressed salad and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
