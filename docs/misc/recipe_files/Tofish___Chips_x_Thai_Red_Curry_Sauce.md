## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips

Add the chunky chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and cooked through – these are your chunky chips


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add half the creamed coconut and your red Thai curry paste to a pot with a lid with half your soy sauce, your ginger & garlic paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, your lime leaf[ves] and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick curry-like consistency, then cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your Thai red curry sauce


### Step 3

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your cornflour and 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g] </span>flour to a large bowl with the turmeric, the remaining soy sauce and a squeeze of your lime juice

Add half the chopped coriander and 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>very cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your batter


### Step 4

When the chips are almost done, drain your tofu, and cut the block[s] into three then each third in half again on a diagonal to create 3 pieces per person

Pat the tofu pieces dry with kitchen paper, sprinkle with flour, then tap off any excess

Dip the floured tofu into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden and crispy – this is your tofish


### Step 6

Add your blanched peas, remaining chopped creamed coconut and a splash of cold water to a separate pot over a medium heat

Once warm, mash the peas roughly until you have a mix of mushed and whole peas


### Step 7

Once mashed, add the remaining chopped coriander, a squeeze of lime juice and a pinch of salt to the pot

Give everything a good mix up – these are your coconut & lime mushy peas

cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Return the Thai red curry sauce to a low heat to reheat gently

Serve the tofish with the chunky chips, coconut & lime mushy peas and Thai red curry sauce to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
