## Ingredients

- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Red potato x2
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Leek
- Parsley (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Pierce your red potato[es] with a fork, then add them to a plate and cook in the microwave for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 2

While the potato is in the microwave, chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to a pot with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling reduce the heat to medium and cook  for 4-5 min or until the fish is starting to cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Strain the fish, reserving the pot and the poaching milk


### Step 3

Chop your parsley, including the stalks

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Once the potato[es] is cooked through, carefully slice in half (it will be very hot!) and scoop the potato flesh out into a bowl, leaving a little around the edges of the skin

Combine the potato flesh with your soft cheese, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash it all together – this is your creamy mash


### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk your reserved poaching milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add the poached basa and chopped parsley to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper and gently stir until fully coated – this is your fish pie filling


### Step 6

Transfer the potato skins to a baking tray and divide the fish pie filling between them, then top with the creamy mash and the grated cheese

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until golden brown and the fish is cooked through – these are your fish pie loaded jacket potatoes


### Step 7

Add your sliced leek to the middle of a large piece of tin foil with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>butter and a splash of cold water and mix everything together

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the leek to form a sealed parcel[s] and add it to a separate baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the leek has softened

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 8

Serve the fish pie loaded jacket potatoes with the buttery leeks & peas to the side

Enjoy!
