- 400g canned red kidney beans
-  2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp Turmeric
- 50g solid coconut cream
- 10g coriander
- 80g shredded kale
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and finely chop the rest


### Step 2

Dice 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> tomatoes chop the rest into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the tomato wedges with the chopped garlic and tomato paste

Cook for a further 5-6 min or until the tomatoes have broken down


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a separate wide-based pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat.

Once hot, add the chopped red onions and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften, then increase the heat to high and add the diced tomatoes with the shredded kale and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the kale has wilted


### Step 5

Once the tomato wedges have softened, add the ground coriander, ground cumin and turmeric and stir to combine

Drain and rinse the kidney beans, then add them to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water, the Kallo vegetable stock cube and coconut cream

Give it a good mix up, then bring up to the boil

Once boiling, reduce to a low heat and cook for 5-6 min further or until the kidney beans are cooked through


### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the Swahili kidney bean stew alongside the sukuma wiki and steamed rice

Enjoy!
