## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chop very roughly

Peel and chop your garlic very roughly

Roughly separate your coriander leaves from their stalks and set them aside


### Step 4

Add the chopped onion, ginger paste, chopped garlic, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), curry powder and coriander stalks (reserve the leaves for garnish!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your Sri Lankan-style curry paste

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!


### Step 5

Add the Sri Lankan-style curry paste to the browned chicken and reduce the heat to medium-high, then cook for 3-4 min

Boil half a kettle


### Step 6

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then dissolve in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span>[425ml]</span> boiled water

Add your red wine vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock and your cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until a thick sauce remains and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

While the curry is cooking, chop the reserved coriander leaves roughly

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and season with salt and pepper – this is your Sri Lankan-style chicken curry

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style chicken curry over the basmati rice

Garnish with your crispy onions and chopped coriander leaves

Enjoy!
