- Tomato x2
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- British diced chicken thigh (250g)
- White potato x3
- White wine vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced red onion to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

Peel and finely grate your garlic


### Step 3

Add your diced chicken thigh and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, drain the sliced onion in a sieve and run under cold water until cooled

Return them to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir to combine and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled pink onion


### Step 5

Add your mayo to a bowl with the remaining grated garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix together – this is your garlic mayo

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely


### Step 6

Add the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato to the bowl with the quick-pickled pink onion, add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled onion salad


### Step 7

Once the chips are done, push them to one side and add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a final 2-3 min or until the pitta[s] is warmed through

### Step 8

Cut the warmed pitta in half and fill with the cooked chicken, quick-pickled onion salad and some of the garlic mayo – this is your chicken thigh shawarma pitta

Serve the chicken thigh shawarma pitta with the chips, remaining quick-pickled onion salad and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
