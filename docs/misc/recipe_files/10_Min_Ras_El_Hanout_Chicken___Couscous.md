### Step 1

Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready


Skim through these steps


Wash your fruit and veg


Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!


Boil <span class="text-highlight">half a <span class="text-danger">[full]</span> </span>kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat 


Once hot, add the diced chicken breast with the roasted garlic paste, ras el hanout and harissa paste <span class="text-highlight">(can't</span> handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the <span class="text-highlight">Knorr</span> chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in a heatproof bowl in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water


Add the couscous, stir, cover and set aside until later


### Step 4

Drain the chickpeas


Slice the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely


### Step 5

Add the drained chickpeas and sliced courgettes to the chicken with a splash of boiled water


Cook, covered, for a further 4-5 min or until the chicken <span class="text-highlight">is cooked through</span>


Note: <span class="text-highlight">Please</span> ensure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

<span class="text-highlight">While your chicken is cooking, squeeze</span> the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon into the chicken pan


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the cooked couscous to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your ras el hanout chicken &amp; couscous
