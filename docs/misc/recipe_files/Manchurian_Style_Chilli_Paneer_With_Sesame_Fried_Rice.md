### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil half a kettle and cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for an initial 4 min or until beginning to golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

### Step 3

While the paneer is cooking, chop your pepper[s] roughly

Combine your tomato ketchup, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce and ginger & garlic paste in a bowl

Add your cornflour, half your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Manchurian-style sauce

### Step 4

After an initial 4 min, add the chopped pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 5

While the pepper is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1642010066441-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a separate, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your blanched peas and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once the rice is cooked, add the cooked rice to the pan with your toasted sesame oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame fried rice

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1642010081751-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the Manchurian-style sauce to the pan with the paneer and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency – this is your Manchurian-style chilli paneer

Meanwhile, trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

### Step 8

Serve the sesame fried rice in a bowl with the Manchurian-style chilli paneer to the side

Sprinkle over the chopped spring onion and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
