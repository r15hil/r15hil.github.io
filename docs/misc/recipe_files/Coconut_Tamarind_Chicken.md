## Ingredients

- 80g green beans
- 100g carrots
- 1 tbsp tamarind paste
- 1 coconut cream sachet (50g)
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 1 chicken breast fillet
- 2 spring onions
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 soy sauce sachets (16ml)
- 3 wheat noodle nests

## Instructions


### Step 1

Place a wide-based pan (ideally non-stick and with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil


When hot, add the chicken and colour on each side for 3 min or until golden


Season each side generously with salt&nbsp;


### Step 2

Once golden, add a splash of water (approx. 2-3 tbsp) and cover immediately with a lid (stand back as it will spit!)


Tip: The trapped water creates steam for even cooking


Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 7-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through, lowering the heat if necessary


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle for step 5


Peel and cut the carrots into bite-size pieces, discarding the root ends


Trim the green beans and cut them in half widthways


Soak the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in a bowl of very hot water (this softens it)


### Step 4

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board and allow to rest for 5 min


Add the carrot to the same pan with a large pinch of salt


Cook over a medium-high heat for 3 min or until coloured and caramelised


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the noodles to a pot of salted boiling water (enough to cover them) on a high heat


Boil for 5-7 min or until cooked through but with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and briefly rinse them under cold, running water until cooled slightly, then return them to the pot off the heat


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the green beans to the caramelised carrots and cover again with a lid


Cook for 5 min over a medium-low heat or until both vegetables are tender&nbsp;


Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic finely


### Step 7

Combine the tamarind paste, coconut cream, honey, soy sauce and garlic with 50ml <span class="text-danger">(100ml)</span> boiled water


Mix well - this is your tamarind sauce&nbsp;


Shred the chicken with two forks, 'pulling' at the chicken to tear it&nbsp;


Chop the spring onions finely, discarding the root ends

### Step 8

Add the noodles and shredded chicken to the pan of vegetables and dress with the tamarind sauce


Mix well and serve garnished with chopped spring onion


Enjoy!
