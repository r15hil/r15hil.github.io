### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your cauliflower[s] into 1 steak per person, approx. 3cm thick (use the middle part as it's larger!), reserve the remaining cauliflower and discard the leaves

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), cut into large chunks, then crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife, discard the skin

### Step 2

Add the cauliflower steak[s] to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, a knob of butter and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>boiled water

Scrunch the foil around the cauliflower to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper[s], peeled garlic and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pepper is slightly charred

### Step 3

Cut the remaining cauliflower into small florets

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Wash your spinach then pat it dry with kitchen paper and set aside until later

### Step 4

Add the chopped sweet potato and cauliflower florets to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and bring to the boil

Cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain, return them to the pot and cover to keep warm

### Step 5

Add your flaked almonds to a food processor with half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and your ground smoked paprika

Add your tomato paste, red wine vinegar, half your dried thyme (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Once the pepper is slightly charred, remove the tray[s] from the oven and transfer the roasted pepper and garlic to the food processor – this is your romesco mix

### Step 6

Open the cauliflower parcel[s], then add the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and remaining dried thyme with a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 5 min or until the cauliflower is golden and tender – this is your cheesy cauliflower steak

### Step 7

Meanwhile, blitz the romesco mix until smooth – this is your romesco sauce

Return the pot with the drained potato and cauliflower to a low heat with a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Once the butter has melted, mash until smooth – this is your cauliflower & sweet potato mash

### Step 8

Serve the cauliflower & sweet potato mash with the spinach to the side

Top with the romesco sauce and cheesy cauliflower steak

Enjoy!
