### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your aubergine[s] lengthways into halves (keep the green stalks on)

Place the aubergine half[ves] onto a plate and put the plate in the microwave for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 2

Whilst the aubergine is in the microwave, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then add the garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, remove the aubergine from the microwave and transfer to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 15-16 min or until cooked through, softened and tender

Boil a kettle

### Step 4

Once the shallot and garlic has softened, add your ground cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Just add a little!), ground coriander and ground cumin and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, turn the heat up to high, then add your lamb mince and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 5

Whilst the lamb mince is browning, dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water with the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1646755764191-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the lamb mince has browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 7-8 min or until the sauce has reduced to a bolognese-like consistency and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced lamb

While the sauce is reducing, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1646756090763-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add most of the chopped parsley (save a little for garnish!) and chopped tomato to the drained bulgur with your ground sumac, a grind of black pepper, a very generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and mix well – this is your tabbouleh

Once the aubergine is cooked through, remove the tray from the oven, then take a spoon and scoop one big spoonful from the roasted aubergine half[ves] (careful, it will be hot!)

Add the scooped aubergine flesh to the spiced lamb and mix everything together

### Step 8

To serve, place the aubergine half on a plate and stuff with the spiced lamb mixture

Serve the tabbouleh to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
