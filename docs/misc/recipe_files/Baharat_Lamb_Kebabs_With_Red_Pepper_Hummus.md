- 1 garlic clove
- 4 skewers

- 75g bulgur wheat

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high, then add the skewers to a bowl of cold water and set aside


De-seed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>,<span class="text-danger"> </span>cut into wedges then add them to a tin foil lined baking tray and drizzle with vegetable oil 


Put the tray under the grill for 10 min or until softened and lightly charred, then once done, transfer the roasted pepper to a food processor and reserve the tray


### Step 2

While the red pepper is cooking, add the lamb mince, baharat, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a large mixing bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully combined


Divide the lamb mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and shape into sausage shapes – these are your lamb kebabs


Skewer each lamb kebab and set aside


### Step 3

Boil a kettle


Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, cook for 7-8 min or until tender with a bite


Once done, drain and return to the pot


### Step 4

Add the lamb kebabs to the reserved baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Put the tray under the grill for 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), turning once half way – these are your baharat lamb kebabs


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the chickpeas


Peel and roughly chop the garlic


Add the chopped garlic and drained chickpeas to the food processor


<span class="text-highlight">Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> olive oil</span>, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> salt and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon


Blitz until smooth – this is your red pepper hummus


### Step 6

Strip the mint leaves from their stalks, and chop them finely


Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


Add most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish) to the drained bulgur


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and add the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon


Stir it all together – this is your herby bulgur


### Step 7

Add the wholemeal pittas to a toaster and toast until golden and crisp


Alternatively, add them to a baking tray and put them under the grill for 2 min or until crisp


Once done, chop the crispy pitta into strips


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the baharat lamb kebabs over the red pepper hummus with the herby bulgur and crispy pitta strips to the side


Garnish with the reserved chopped herbs and a wedge of lemon


Enjoy!
