## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 3

Slice a quarter of the red onion wedges finely and set aside for serving


### Step 4

Add your meat-free mince to the dish with the red onion wedges and a pinch of salt

Give everything a stir, breaking the meat-free mince up into rough, large pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

Drain and rinse your black beans

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin


### Step 5

Add your ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika and crushed garlic to the dish and stir it all up


### Step 6

Add the drained black beans to the dish with your tomato paste and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [425ml] </span>boiled water

Add your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 20 min – this is your oven baked meat-free mince & black bean chilli

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After 20 min, chop your tortillas into quarters (keep them stacked for speedy chopping!)

Add the tortillas quarters to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through and lightly golden around the edges

Remove the pot from the oven and leave it covered for 5 min (this helps the flavours to develop)

### Step 8

To serve, tear your coriander leaves all over the oven baked meat-free mince & black bean chilli and garnish with the reserved sliced red onion

Dollop over your natural yoghurt and grate your cheddar cheese all over

Serve with the baked tortilla quarters to the side for scooping

Dig in!
