## Ingredients

- 120g cheddar cheese
- 0 macaroni
- 1 butternut squash cubes
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp ground sumac
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 0 harissa paste
- 40g harissa paste
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 150g macaroni
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 5g parsley
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the squash is tender – this is your roasted butternut squash


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the macaroni reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>starchy pasta water and set aside until later, reserve the pot


### Step 3

While the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your panko breadcrumbs with your ground sumac, 1/3 of your grated cheese and a drizzle of olive oil – this your sumac crumb


### Step 4

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the onion – this is your roux


### Step 5

Gradually whisk in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk and the starchy pasta water to the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once done, add the remaining grated cheese, vegetable stock mix and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your harissa béchamel sauce


### Step 6

Add the roasted butternut squash to the harissa béchamel sauce with the drained macaroni and stir everything together – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to an oven-proof dish

Sprinkle over the sumac crumb and put the dish in the oven for 10 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your harissa mac 'n' cheese


### Step 7

While the mac 'n' cheese is cooking, wash your baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad to a large bowl with your white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressed salad

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the harissa mac 'n' cheese with the dressed salad to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
