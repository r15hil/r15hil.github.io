## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add the wholewheat tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 10-12 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 4

Once hot, add the bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp

Once done, transfer the crispy bacon to kitchen paper and set aside

Reserve the pan


### Step 5

Once the wholewheat tortiglioni has had 10-12 min, add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the broccoli is tender and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Once done, drain the wholewheat tortiglioni and broccoli, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Return the reserved bacon pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the tomato paste, pesto and soft cheese and a generous grind of pepper

Taste for seasoning, adding a pinch more salt if needed and cook for 1 min or until fully combined – this is your creamy red pesto sauce


### Step 7

Add the drained wholewheat tortiglioni and broccoli to the creamy red pesto sauce with a splash of the starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy red pesto & broccoli wholewheat tortiglioni

Top with the crispy bacon, grated cheddar and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
