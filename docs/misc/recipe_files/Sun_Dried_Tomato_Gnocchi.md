### Step 1

Boil half a kettle, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp, then transfer to a plate, reserving the pan

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half
