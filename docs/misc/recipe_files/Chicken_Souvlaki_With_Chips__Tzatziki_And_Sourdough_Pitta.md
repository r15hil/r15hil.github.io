## Ingredients

- Mediterranean style seasoning (3g)
- Sourdough pittas (2pcs)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Tomato
- British skinless chicken thighs (160g) x0
- White potato x3
- British skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove
- Skewers x4
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Soak your skewers in cold water (this stops them from burning whilst cooking!)

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put in the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s] and peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your chicken thighs, Mediterranean-style seasoning and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your marinated chicken thighs


### Step 3

Thread the marinated chicken thighs onto the soaked skewers in a snake-like fashion – these are your marinated chicken skewers


### Step 4

Remove the tray[s] with the chips from the oven and add half the sliced shallot (you'll use the rest later!), then place the marinated chicken skewers on top

Tip: This will allow your chips to soak up all the juices and give them extra flavour!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 22-25 min or until the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken souvlaki skewers


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice half of your cucumber into discs

Cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 6

Add the cucumber discs, chopped tomato and the remaining sliced shallot to a bowl with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber & tomato salad


### Step 7

Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with the remaining grated garlic, your natural yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tzatziki

When the chicken and chips are almost ready, add your sourdough pitta[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through, then slice in half

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the chicken souvlaki with the chips, cucumber & tomato salad and tzatziki to the side

Serve with the halved sourdough pitta and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
