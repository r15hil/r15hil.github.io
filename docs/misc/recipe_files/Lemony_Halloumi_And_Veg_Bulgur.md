## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Halloumi (200g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Parsley (5g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Bulgur wheat (130g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Add the chopped tomatoes and chopped onion to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until the onion is cooked and starting to crisp


### Step 3

While the tomato and onion is cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with a lid with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water over a medium heat

Cook, covered for 5-7 min or until almost all the water has absorbed

Once done, remove the pot from the heat, fluff with a fork and set aside until later


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut your halloumi into 3 pieces per person


### Step 5

Combine the juice of your lemon[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, your dried oregano and half of the chopped garlic in a medium bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herb marinade

Dip the halloumi in the herb marinade (reserve any remaining marinade)


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi to the pan and cook for 1-2 min on each side until almost browning, add the remaining herb marinade to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min

Once done, transfer to a chopping board and set aside – this is your lemony halloumi


### Step 7

Roughly chop your cucumber and add to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tzatziki

Add the roasted vegetables and chopped parsley to the pot with the cooked bulgur and give it a good mix up – this is your Mediterranean-style veg bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the lemony halloumi over the Mediterranean-style veg bulgur with the tzatziki on the side

Enjoy!
