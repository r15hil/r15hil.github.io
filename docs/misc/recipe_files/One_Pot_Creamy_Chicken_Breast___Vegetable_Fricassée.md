### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the dish with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook 4-5 min or until lightly browned

Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Chop your chestnut mushrooms into quarters

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

### Step 5

Add the onion wedges, sliced carrot, diced potatoes, chopped mushrooms and crushed garlic to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Add your chicken stock mix, Chinese rice wine and 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [455ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[650ml]</span> boiled water and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 6

Once boiling, cover the dish with a lid and put it in the oven for an initial 25 min or until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Use the rest of the cooking time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

After 25 min, add your blanched peas, soft cheese and half of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish to the oven, covered, for a final 5 min or until the peas are warmed through – this is your one-pot creamy chicken & vegetable fricassée

### Step 8

To serve, taste the one-pot creamy chicken & vegetable fricassée for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper as needed

Sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley all over

Dig in!
