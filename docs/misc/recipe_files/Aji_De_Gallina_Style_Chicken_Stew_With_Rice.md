### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml [450ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and cut the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large wedges

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the onion petals, chopped pepper and peeled garlic

Cook for 2-3 min or until starting to char

### Step 4

Chop the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Add the walnuts and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk to a food processor with 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the chicken stock mix, Italian hard cheese , 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 5

Once the veg is starting to char, transfer the charred pepper to the food processor with the garlic and half the onion petals – this is your aji de gallina mix

### Step 6

Return the pan with the remaining onion to a medium-high heat and add the chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, blitz the aji de gallina mix until smooth – this is your aji de gallina sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1683039627546-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Slice the remaining red chilli finely

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the aji de gallina-style sauce to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and thickened – this is your aji de gallina-style chicken stew

### Step 8

Serve the aji de gallina-style chicken stew with the cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Top with the chopped parsley and sliced red chillies (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
