## Ingredients

- Conchiglie (100g) x0
- Heritage tomatoes (160g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Basil (10g)
- Basil (5g) x0
- Conchiglie (200g)
- Rocket (20g)
- Lime
- Asparagus spears (120g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop your heritage tomatoes in half

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus and discard, then chop the spears in half

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!


### Step 2

Add the chopped heritage tomatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to blister and caramelise


### Step 3

Add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for an initial 7 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, roughly tear half your basil, including the stalks (you’ll use the rest later!)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 5

Add the torn basil and a large pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and bash for 1-2 min or until it looks like a purée (or pulse in a food processor)

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> olive oil with your<span class="text-danger"> </span>Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar, a generous crack of black pepper and the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s]

Stir to combine – this is your basil & lime dressing


### Step 6

Once the pasta has been cooking for 7 min, add the chopped asparagus to the pot and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the pasta is cooked with a slight bite and the asparagus is tender

Once done, drain and run both under cold water until slightly cooled

Tip: If you prefer your salad warm, don't run the pasta and asparagus under cold water!


### Step 7

Peel most of your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Chop the remaining basil finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the conchiglie & asparagus and top with the salad and roasted heritage tomatoes, then drizzle over the basil & lime dressing

Season with a grind of black pepper and sprinkle over the Italian hard cheese shavings and grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the chopped basil and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
