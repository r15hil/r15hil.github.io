## Description

This method of cooking aubergines originates from Gujarat on India's western coast. A predominantly vegetarian region, pulses and lots of fresh vegetables usually form the base for curries in this area. Here you'll create an aubergine curry known as 'ringra nu shaak', and will serve it with a cumin & cucumber raita.

### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high

Add half your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(you'll use the rest later!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray and pierce a few times with a knife, then put the tray under the grill for 20-25 min or until blackened all over and fork-tender

Once done, remove the tray from the oven and carefully (it will be hot!) scoop the flesh out of the blackened aubergine into a bowl and season generously with salt – this is your smoky aubergine

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4</span> <span class="text-danger">tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your ground coriander, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half of your ground cumin (you'll use the rest later), tomato paste and your vegetable stock mix with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chopped aubergine is cooked through

### Step 5

Dice your cucumber finely and add to a bowl

Chop your coriander roughly, including stalks

Gently mash the smoky aubergine with a spoon

Once the chopped aubergine is cooked through, stir the smoky mashed aubergine and chopped coriander through the curry – this is your Gujarati-style aubergine curry

Remove from the heat and set aside until serving
