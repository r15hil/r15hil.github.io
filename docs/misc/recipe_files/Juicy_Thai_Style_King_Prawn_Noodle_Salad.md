## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil kettle

Cut your lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] with your soy sauce, rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar – this is your dressing

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 3

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and rinse the noodles under cold water until slightly cooled and return them to the pot


### Step 4

Once the pan is hot, add your ginger & garlic paste, king prawns and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your chilli prawns


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce[s] then pat it dry with kitchen paper roughly and chop

Grate your carrot[s] (skin on)


### Step 6

Chop your coriander roughly (including the stalks)


### Step 7

Add the chopped lettuce, grated carrot and chilli prawns to the cooled noodles

Add the most of the dressing and give it a good mix up – this is your Thai-style king prawn noodle salad

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style king prawn noodle salad

Drizzle over the remaining dressing and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
