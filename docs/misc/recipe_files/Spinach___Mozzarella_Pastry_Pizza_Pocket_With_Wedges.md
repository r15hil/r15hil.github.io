## Ingredients

- Puff pastry (160g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Spinach (120g)
- Spinach (80g) x0
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water to a small bowl with your tomato paste, dried oregano and a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar

Season with a generous pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy wedges


### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Chop the drained mozzarella into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 6

Spread the tomato sauce within the border of the pastries

Add the chopped mozzarella and spinach to one half of the rectangle[s]

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)


### Step 7

Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the mixture, then press the edges down with a fork

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your spinach & mozzarella pastry pizza pocket

### Step 8

Cut the spinach & mozzarella pastry pizza pocket in half and serve with the crispy wedges and your mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
