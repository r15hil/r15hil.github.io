## Ingredients

- 0 British bacon lardons
- 80g cheddar cheese
- 0 macaroni
- 80g fine green beans
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 0 ground smoked paprika
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 100g British bacon lardons
- 1 chestnut mushrooms
- 1 chestnut mushrooms
- 150g macaroni
- 1 leek
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice your chestnut mushrooms

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until the bacon is cooked through and crisp

Transfer to a plate (reserve the pan for later!) – these are your crispy lardons & mushrooms


### Step 3

While the lardons and mushrooms are cooking, add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the macaroni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 4

While the macaroni is cooking, melt 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter in the reserved pan over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced leek, chopped garlic, half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min until softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the leek – this is your leek roux


### Step 5

Gradually whisk 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk into the leek roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-6 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains  – this is your leek béchamel sauce

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Combine half the grated cheese (save the rest for later!) with your panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl with the remaining ground smoked paprika – these are your smoky breadcrumbs


### Step 6

Add your drained macaroni to the pan with the leek béchamel sauce

Add the remaining grated cheese, crispy lardons & mushrooms, Dijon mustard, season with pepper and give everything a good mix up until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy pasta mix

Add a few splashes of starchy pasta water to loosen the mixture

Tip: You want your sauce to be quite loose as it will continue to thicken in the oven!


### Step 7

Transfer the cheesy pasta mix to an oven-proof dish, then top with the smoky breadcrumbs and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until it's golden – this is your smoky bacon, mushroom & leek mac 'n' cheese

Meanwhile, trim, then chop your green beans in half,  then add to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

### Step 8

Serve your smoky bacon, mushroom & leek mac 'n' cheese with a generous grind of black pepper and the green beans to the side

Enjoy!
