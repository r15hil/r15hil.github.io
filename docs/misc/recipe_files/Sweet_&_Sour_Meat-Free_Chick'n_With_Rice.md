### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your meat-free chick'n to a bowl with most of your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!) and mix until evenly coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy all over, reserve the bowl – this is your crispy meat-free chick'n

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Once the meat-free chick'n is crispy, transfer it to a plate and set aside for later, then return the pan to a medium heat

Add the chopped pepper and onion and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min or until fragrant
