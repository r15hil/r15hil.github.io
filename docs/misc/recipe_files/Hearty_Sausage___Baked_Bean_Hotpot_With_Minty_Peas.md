- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Mint (5g)
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- Cannellini beans (390g) x1
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Blanched peas (160g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the sliced potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, use scissors to chop your sausages into thirds into the dish and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown


### Step 3

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 4

Once slightly browned, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the drained cannellini beans with your tomato paste and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water to the dish with your Henderson's Relish, soy sauce and chicken stock mix

Season with a pinch of sugar and salt and mix it all together – this is your sausage and bean filling


### Step 6

Top the sausage and bean filling with the sliced potatoes and sprinkle over your dried thyme

Put the dish in the oven, lid off, for 20-25 min or until the potatoes and sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your hearty sausage & baked bean hotpot

### Step 7

When the hotpot is almost ready, reboil a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiling water (just enough to cover them), bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Once ready, drain and return to the pot, then stir through a small knob of butter with the chopped mint

### Step 8

Serve the hearty sausage & baked bean hotpot with the minty peas to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper
