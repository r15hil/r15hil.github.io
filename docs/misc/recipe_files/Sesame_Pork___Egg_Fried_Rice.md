## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Once the pork has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice, soy sauce and toasted sesame oil to the pan, breaking up the rice with a wooden spoon as you go

Give everything a good mix up until all the rice is coated


### Step 6

Once the rice is coated, add your blanched peas and grated carrot to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the rice is piping hot and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once done, turn down the heat to medium-high, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolks and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your sesame pork & egg fried rice


### Step 8

Serve the sesame pork & egg fried rice in bowls

Garnish with the chopped spring onion and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
