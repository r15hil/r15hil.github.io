### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil to a baking tray and put the tray on the bottom shelf of the oven to heat up

Peel and halve the potatoes, then add them to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are boiling, peel and chop the parsnips into batons

Tip: Keep the parsnip tips thick to stop them from burning!

Trim and halve the Chantenay carrots (no need to peel!)

Once the potatoes are done, drain them in a colander and shake them until they're fluffy

Reserve the pot for later

### Step 3

Add the parsnips and Chantenay carrots to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Add the turkey joint (leave the string on!) and pigs in blankets to the other side of the tray

Season the turkey with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray on the top shelf of the oven for an initial 7-8 min or until the potatoes are done

### Step 4

Carefully add the potatoes to the tray with the hot oil, turn them until they're fully coated in the oil and season with a pinch of salt

Transfer the turkey tray to the bottom shelf of the oven and return the potatoes to the top shelf and cook for an initial 25 min or until the potatoes are starting to crisp and the turkey joint is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, re-boil half a kettle

### Step 5

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the Henderson's Relish and Marmite

Return the pot to a medium-low heat with 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Gradually add the stock to the pan and cook for 10-15 min or until thickened

### Step 6

Slice the Brussels sprouts into thirds, and peel and finely slice the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced sprouts to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 10 min stirring frequently or until starting to caramelise

Combine the wholegrain mustard and honey in a bowl – this is your honey mustard glaze

### Step 7

Once the potatoes and turkey have had 25 min, remove the turkey from the oven and set aside to rest

Drizzle the honey mustard glaze over the carrots and parsnips and return them to the oven with the potatoes for 10 min further or until the potatoes are golden and crispy

Meanwhile, add the sliced garlic and pine nuts to the sprouts and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant

### Step 8

Warm up the gravy over a low heat

Remove the string from the rested turkey, and slice it

Serve with the pigs in blankets, roast potatoes, honey mustard veg and garlic & pine nut sprouts to the side

Add a dollop of cranberry sauce to the side and drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!
