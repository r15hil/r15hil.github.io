## Ingredients

- Panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Parsley (10g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Garlic clove
- Courgette
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Parsley (5g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until beginning to turn golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and dice your courgette[s]

Add the diced courgette to a bowl with your dried oregano, a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated courgette

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once the potatoes have had 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved tomatoes and the marinated courgette

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5 min


### Step 4

While the vegetables are in the oven, grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the grated cheese and panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs


### Step 5

Cover your free range chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened

Transfer the flattened chicken to a plate and drizzle with olive oil

Then press the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly into the chicken to evenly coat all over – this is your crumbed chicken


### Step 6

After the courgette and tomatoes have had 5 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the crumbed chicken

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 20 min further or until the breadcrumbs are crisp and golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Provençal-style crumbed free range chicken and roasted veg


### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and chopped parsley to a small bowl with a generous pinch of salt and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Stir it all together – this is your garlic & parsley oil

### Step 8

Serve the Provençal-style crumbed free range chicken over the roasted veg

Drizzle the garlic & parsley oil all over

Enjoy!
