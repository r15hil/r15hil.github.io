- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 190g wholewheat spaghetti

- 15ml balsamic vinegar

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the meat-free mince and dried basil to a bowl with a generous grind of pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Divide the mince mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> and shape into meatballs – these are your meat-free mince meatballs


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free mince meatballs and cook for 3 min, turning occasionally, until browned all over

Once browned, transfer the browned meat-free mince meatballs to a plate and set aside


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium heat

Tip: Add a drizzle of olive oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Once hot, add the chopped onion and grated carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until beginning to soften

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 5

Add the wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the wholewheat spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked wholewheat spaghetti and return it to the pot


### Step 6

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water

Once the carrot and onion have softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, vegetable stock, balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and stir it all together

Add the browned meat-free mince meatballs and cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until cooked through


### Step 7

Whilst everything is cooking, chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

Once the meat-free mince meatballs are cooked through, add the drained wholewheat spaghetti to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your spaghetti & meat-free mince meatballs

### Step 8

Serve the spaghetti & meat-free mince meatballs

Top with the grated Italian hard cheese, chopped basil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
