## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

<span class="text-highlight">While the rice is cooking, combine</span> the ground allspice, smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) on a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your jerk seasoning


### Step 3

Trim the fat from the pork loin steaks


Add the pork loin steaks to the jerk seasoning and turn them until they're fully coated in all the spices

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the coated pork loin steaks and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through


Transfer the cooked steaks to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 2 min<span class="text-highlight"> – these are your spicy pork steaks</span>


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onions finely


Drain and roughly chop the pineapple slices


Chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters 


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Combine the chopped pineapple and cherry tomatoes with most of the spring onion and coriander (save the rest for garnish!)


Add a pinch of salt and the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime and give it a good mix up – this is your pineapple salsa


### Step 7

Finely slice the <span class="text-highlight">rested spicy pork steaks</span>


Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the <span class="text-highlight">sliced spicy pork steaks </span>with the brown rice and pineapple salsa to the side
