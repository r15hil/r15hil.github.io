## Ingredients

- Baguettes (2pcs)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- White cup mushrooms (80g)
- Carrot
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your white cup mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter  over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 6-8 min or until browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel half your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons and grate the remaining carrot

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice half the cucumber lengthways and slice the remaining cucumber into half moons

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then finely chop half your mint and coriander and set aside the remaining leaves


### Step 4

Combine half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with the grated carrot, cucumber half moons, chopped herbs and a small pinch of salt – this is your quick-pickled salad

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with the remaining rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a small splash of cold water – this is your sriracha mayo


### Step 5

Once the mushrooms are browned, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to food processor (reserve the pan for later!) with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your mushroom pâté


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min or until warmed through and starting to brown

Once starting to brown, add your red chilli relish to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli meat-free chick'n


### Step 7

Once everything is nearly ready, add your baguette[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through and crusty

### Step 8

Slice each warmed baguette in half (without cutting all the way through) and open it out like a book

Spread over the mushroom pâté and top with the sweet chilli meat-free chick'n, carrot ribbons, cucumber slices and mint & coriander leaves – this is your sweet chilli meat-free chick'n & mushroom báhn mì

Serve the quick-pickled salad and sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!
