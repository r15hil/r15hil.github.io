### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine the chicken thighs with half the peri-peri spice mix (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, half the red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl and set aside – this is your marinated chicken

### Step 2

While the chicken is marinating, peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Heat a pot with a lid on a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!), ground smoked paprika, ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato, white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray (reserve the pan!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri-peri chicken

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining grated garlic, remaining peri-peri spice mix (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and tomato paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant – this is your peri-peri tomato mix

Once fragrant, add the peri-peri tomato mix to a small bowl with the remaining red wine vinegar, mayo and a pinch of sugar and mix until fully combined – this is your perinaise

### Step 6

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1681817598033-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a pot on a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the blanched peas and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until they're warmed through

Once warmed through, add the chopped mint and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your punchy peas

### Step 8

Once done, stir the chicken stock mix through the cooked rice – this is your spiced rice

Serve the peri-peri chicken with the spiced rice, punchy peas and perinaise to the side

Enjoy!
