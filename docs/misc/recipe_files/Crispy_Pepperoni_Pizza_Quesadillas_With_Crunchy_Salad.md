### Step 2

Combine the chopped garlic with your tomato paste, dried oregano and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl

Add a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar and stir it all together – this is your pizza sauce

### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese

Roughly chop your basil, including the stalks

### Step 4

Divide the pizza sauce between your tortillas (make sure to only cover one half of the tortilla with the sauce!)

Top the sauce evenly with the grated cheddar, chopped basil, pepperoni slices and grated Italian hard cheese

Fold each tortilla over so you're left with 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>half moon-shaped sandwiches per person– these are your loaded quesadillas

### Step 5

Add the loaded quesadillas to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Place a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 12 min, or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted

### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your creamy dressing

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1600415925308-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the quesadillas are slightly browned, remove the stacked trays from the oven and leave them to cool for 1 min

Tip: This makes it easier to transfer the quesadillas to a board without losing any filling!

Chop the quesadillas in half – these are your crispy pepperoni pizza quesadillas

### Step 8

Serve the crispy pepperoni pizza quesadillas with the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato to the side

Drizzle the creamy dressing all over the salad

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
