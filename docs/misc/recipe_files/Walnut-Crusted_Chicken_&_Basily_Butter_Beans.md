## Description

Walnuts are full of heart-healthy fats, so we've used them twice. First, you'll sprinkle them on chicken breasts for delicious crunch. Then whizz them up in a pesto and stir into quinoa and butter beans.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add the walnuts to a pestle & mortar and bash into a coarse powder (or pulse in a food processor)

Rub the chicken breasts with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and add them to a baking tray

Top the chicken with half the bashed walnuts

Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 180ml <span class="text-danger">[360ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until warmed through – these are your basily butter beans

Finely slice the cooked walnut-crusted chicken

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the sliced walnut-crusted chicken over the basily butter beans and the lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
