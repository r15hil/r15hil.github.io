## Description

To give this paella-inspired dish a wholesome twist, we've swapped rice for quinoa – which is higher in protein and fibre. Serve with lemony prawns, pan-fried cherry tomatoes and chopped parsley. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water, then add it to the pan with the ground smoked paprika and vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 6-8 min or until the quinoa has absorbed most of the liquid and is cooked through

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Drain then add your king prawns and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through

Add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], half of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and a generous grind of black pepper – these are your lemony king prawns

### Step 7

Once the quinoa is cooked, add your blanched peas and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your veg-packed quinoa

Tip: If your quinoa is looking a little dry, add a splash more water!

### Step 8

Serve the lemony king prawns over the veg-packed quinoa with a lemon wedge to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
