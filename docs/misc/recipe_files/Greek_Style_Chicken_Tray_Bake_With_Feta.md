## Ingredients

- British skin-on chicken thighs (160g) x0
- Black olives (40g)
- Red onion
- Feta (30g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Garlic clove x3
- British skin-on chicken thighs (320g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Courgette
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle them with olive oil and season generously with salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them with salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel your red onion[s] and cut into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut into wedges

Squeeze the juice of the lemon wedges into a large bowl (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Add the juiced wedges to the bowl


### Step 5

Add the crisped chicken thighs, chopped garlic, chopped courgette, your dried oregano and the onion wedges to the bowl with the lemon

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season with salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken mixture


### Step 6

Once the potatoes have had 15 min, add the chicken mixture to the baking tray

Tip: Place the chicken thighs skin-side up for extra crispiness!

Return the tray to the oven for 10 min further


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

After 10 min, add your black olives and the halved tomatoes to the baking tray and crumble your feta over the top

Return the tray to the oven for a final 5-10 min or until the potatoes are tender, the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the feta is starting to colour

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style chicken tray bake

Enjoy!
