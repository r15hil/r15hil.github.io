## Ingredients

- 1 harissa paste sachet (40g)
- 1 courgette
- 10g mint
- 15g pumpkin seeds
- 125g baby plum tomatoes
- 50g wild rocket
- 120g natural yoghurt
- 1 aubergine
- 1 lemon
- 75g bulgur wheat
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Cut the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into batons 


Chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)


Trim the green stalk off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut lengthways into wedges


### Step 2

Add the baby plum tomatoes, chopped courgette, red onion and aubergine to a baking tray


Drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the harissa paste and give it a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until softened and golden


Once done, cut off the onion root to remove the skins


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a dry pot over a high heat


Once hot, add the pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until golden and toasted


Tip: watch the seeds like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


Once done, transfer them to a plate and set aside, reserving the pot


### Step 4

Add the bulgur wheat to the reserved pot with plenty of <span class="text-highlight">boiled water </span>and a pinch of salt (the same as you <span class="text-highlight">would for pasta) </span>


<span class="text-highlight">Cook over</span> a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Combine the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and the natural yoghurt with a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your lemon yoghurt


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


### Step 6

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly


### Step 7

Wash and dry the rocket


Add the washed rocket and half the chopped mint to the drained bulgur wheat


Give everything a good mix up – this is your bulgur wheat salad

### Step 8

Serve the harissa roasted veg over the bulgur wheat salad


Dollop with the lemon yoghurt


Garnish with the remaining chopped mint and lemon wedge


Enjoy!
