## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix
- 150g rice noodles
- 25g roasted peanuts 
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 15ml tamari soy sauce
- 2 British chicken breasts
- 1 carrot
- 15g tamarind paste
- 3g cornflour
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add the rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 2

Slice the chicken breasts into strips

Add the chicken strips, cornflour and soy sauce to a bowl

Mix well and set aside to marinate


### Step 3

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely, separating the white parts from the green parts

Chop the roasted peanuts (or crush them in the bag with a rolling pin)


### Step 4

In a small bowl combine the tamarind paste, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> brown sugar, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> boiled water and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Mix well until the sugar has dissolved

Add a pinch of salt – this is your tamarind sauce


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and stir for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coated chicken and cook for 2-3 min or until browned

Once the chicken has browned, add the chicken stock and cook for a further 4-6 min


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 7

Add the sugar snap peas to the pan and cook for a further 3 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the drained rice noodles, tamarind sauce and spring onion whites and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken & sugar snap pad Thai

Serve the chicken & sugar snap pad Thai with the grated carrot to the side

Garnish with the crushed peanuts and sliced spring onion greens
