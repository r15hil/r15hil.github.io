## Description

This recipe uses a Chinese cooking technique known as 'velveting'. It involves coating the mushrooms and peppers in an egg and cornflour mixture, creating a moist, silky stir-fry. Itâ€™s surprisingly simple and makes this torn vegetable stir-fry eggstra special! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

## Ingredients

- 25g chilli jam
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 130g basmati rice
- 25g honey
- 1 British free-range egg
- 1 tbsp cornflour 
- 1 bag of cashew nuts
- 2 spring onions 
- 2 garlic cloves
- 4 soy sauce sachets (24ml)
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Add the cashew nuts to a small baking tray or heatproof dish


Put them in the oven for 5-10 min or until they have darkened slightly in colour


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, tear the portobello mushrooms into large bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and tear them into large bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Tip:&nbsp;we love tearing our veg, it creates a nice, rustic look and means you don't need knife skills!


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) or a wok with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the peppers and mushrooms and cook for 8-10 min or until starting to soften and colour&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Slice the spring onions finely, discarding the root ends


Combine the chopped garlic, chilli jam, honey and soy sauce in a mixing bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> hot water and mix thoroughly &ndash; this is your chilli&nbsp;sauce


### Step 6

Chop the cooled, toasted cashews roughly


Add the cornflour to a bowl&nbsp;


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a separate bowl and whisk lightly


Gradually whisk the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the cornflour until fully combined


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Once the mushrooms and peppers have softened, add the egg mixture and leave it to settle (don't stir) for 1 min


After 1 min, gently flip the egg mixture, add the chilli sauce and cook for a further 2 min, stirring to break up the egg a little as you go&nbsp;


Remove from the heat and stir in half of the sliced spring onion and half of the chopped cashews&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the egg fried vegetables over the rice and garnish with the remaining spring onion and chopped cashews&nbsp;


Enjoy!
