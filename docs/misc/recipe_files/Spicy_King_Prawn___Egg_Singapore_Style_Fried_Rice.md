### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Tip: Watch the garlic like a hawk to make sure it doesn’t burn!

### Step 4

Once softened, add a knob of butter with your ground turmeric and curry powder and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped creamed coconut with your soy sauce and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil, then cook for 1-2 min or until thickened

### Step 5

Once thickened, drain and add your king prawns

Cook for 6-7 min or until cooked through – these are your Singapore-style king prawns

Once cooked through, set aside until the rice is ready

### Step 6

Once the rice is cooked, return the pan with the prawns to a medium-high heat

Add the cooked rice with your blanched peas and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 1 min or until the peas are warmed through

Mix until fully combined

### Step 7

Once done, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg with a wooden spoon to break the yolk and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your spicy king prawn & egg Singapore-style fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the spicy king prawn & egg Singapore-style fried rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
