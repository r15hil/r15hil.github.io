## Ingredients

- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Sushi rice (75g) x0
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Crispy onions (15g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Sushi rice (150g)
- Lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water, your creamed coconut and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat, add your blanched peas and give everything a good mix up, until the peas are warmed through and the coconut cream is fully incorporated

Keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky coconut rice


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the your cornflour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the basa fillet[s] to the plate and press them into the seasoned cornflour until fully coated, then tap off the excess


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa fillets and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 6

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 7

Add the juice of half the lime[s] to a small bowl with your chilli relish, chopped ginger, sriracha (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> water

Stir it all together – this is your sweet chilli sauce

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge

### Step 8

Serve the crispy basa with the sticky coconut rice to the side

Drizzle the basa with the sweet chilli sauce and sprinkle over your crispy onions

Garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
