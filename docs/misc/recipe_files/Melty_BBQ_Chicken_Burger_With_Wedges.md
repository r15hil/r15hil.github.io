## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 2 brioche rolls
- 2 x 140g British chicken burger patties
- 4 white potatoes
- 40g hickory smoked BBQ sauce
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (30ml)
- 1 red gem lettuce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges


### Step 2

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Shred half of the red gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely and chop the rest roughly


### Step 4

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Once the wedges have been in the oven for 10 mins, add the chicken burger patties to a separate tray (use non-stick baking paper to prevent them from sticking!) and put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until starting to brown


### Step 6

Once the chicken burgers have had 12 min, remove the tray from the oven and top them with the grated cheese 


Add the brioche rolls, cut-side up, to the other side of the tray


Return the tray to the oven for 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your melty chicken burgers


### Step 7

Once done, spread the mayonnaise on the top and bottom of the brioche rolls

### Step 8

Assemble the brioche rolls with a handful of finely shredded lettuce, your melty chicken burger and hickory smoked BBQ sauce


Serve the potato wedges and remaining shredded lettuce to the side


Drizzle the lettuce with some olive oil


Enjoy!
