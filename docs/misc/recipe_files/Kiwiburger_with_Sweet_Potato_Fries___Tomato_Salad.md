## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 2 butter brioche buns
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 250g British beef mince
- 1 Dijon mustard pot (18g)
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 skewers
- 250g cooked beetroot
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Peel and cut the sweet potatoes into fries

Add the sweet potato fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> onion and add to a bowl

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic and add to the same bowl with the beef mince and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Shape the mixture into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> burger patties and put onto a baking tray

Put the tray into the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through


### Step 3

Grate the cheddar cheese

Slice half of the cooked beetroot

Dice the remaining beetroot and add to a bowl


### Step 4

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Add to the bowl with the diced beetroot, red wine vinegar, most of the lamb's lettuce (keeping some aside for later) and a generous pinch of salt

Add a drizzle of olive oil and the red wine vinegar and give everything a good mix up

Keep aside for later


### Step 5

Heat a medium wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan and season with a pinch of salt

Cook, covered for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Meanwhile, slice the remaining onion


### Step 6

Once the eggs are cooked, remove to a plate then return the pan to a low heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted, then set them aside until serving


### Step 7

When the burgers have 2 min left, top with the grated cheddar and put back into the oven until the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy patties

### Step 8

To assemble the burgers, spread each brioche slice with the Dijon mustard

Layer up your burger with the sliced beetroot and onion, a cheesy patty and fried egg, and a handful of the reserved lamb's lettuce

Top with the brioche lid, then skewer the burger

Serve with the sweet potato fries, salad and remaining mayonnaise

Enjoy!
