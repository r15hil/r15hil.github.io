- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Orange
- Hoisin sauce (40g)
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- British diced chicken thigh (250g)

- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Mangetout (80g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Add your diced chicken thigh to a bowl with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together until fully coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water


### Step 4

Cut your orange[s] in half

Peel half the orange (you'll use the rest later!) removing all the white pith, then slice into segments


### Step 5

Combine your ginger & garlic paste and hoisin sauce in a bowl with your rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce, the juice of the remaining orange and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your hoisin & orange sauce


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked through, add your mangetout to the pan and cook for 3 min or until slightly softened


### Step 7

Once slightly softened, add the drained noodles and orange segments to the pan with the hoisin & orange sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your hoisin chicken thigh, orange & mangetout noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin chicken thigh, orange & mangetout noodles in a bowl

Enjoy!
