### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 2

Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for 3-5 min or until beginning to golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate, reserve the pan

### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a small pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 5 min, then reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 15 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 4

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the soft inner core[s] finely

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat, discard the outer lemongrass layers and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

Mix well and cook for a further 5 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, stir through your natural yoghurt and give everything a good mix up – this is your paneer, pepper & lemongrass curry

### Step 8

Stir the chopped coriander through the paneer, pepper & lemongrass curry and serve with the lemongrass rice to the side

Enjoy!
