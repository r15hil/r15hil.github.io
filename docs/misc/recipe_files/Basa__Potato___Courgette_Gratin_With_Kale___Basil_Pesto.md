### Step 1

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs then peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Add the sliced potato and onion to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 8-10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender, then remove the cling film to allow to cool

### Step 2

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Wash your shredded kale and spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that is starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted kale & spinach under cold running water until cool, then squeeze out as much water as you can

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 4

Add the cooled wilted kale & spinach to a food processor with your basil, grated Italian hard cheese and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until very finely chopped – this is your kale & basil pesto

### Step 5

Dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add the remaining chopped garlic with your dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby stock

### Step 6

Add the sliced courgette and most of the kale & basil pesto to the bowl with the potatoes (reserve a generous dollop of pesto per person for later!)

Carefully mix together, then transfer to an oven-proof dish

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 dishes!

Pour the herby stock over the top, then put the dish[es] in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until the veg is tender and the top has caramelised – this is your potato & courgette gratin

### Step 7

Once the top of the potato & courgette gratin has caramelised, top with your basa fillet[s], a small drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of pepper

Return the dish[es] to the oven and cook for a final 12-15 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your basa, potato & courgette gratin

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the remaining kale & basil pesto and stir it all together

### Step 8

Serve the basa, potato & courgette gratin with the kale & basil pesto spooned over the fish

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
