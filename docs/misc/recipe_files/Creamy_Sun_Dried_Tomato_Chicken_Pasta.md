## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over your dried basil and dried oregano and drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give the chicken a good mix up until coated in the herbs


### Step 2

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 4

Whilst the onion is cooking, add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the conchiglie, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the garlic is fragrant, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan with your ground paprika and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted


### Step 6

Once done, slice the cooked chicken on a clean chopping board

Cut your sun-dried tomatoes in half


### Step 7

Add the drained conchiglie to the pan with your chicken stock mix, soft cheese, half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), sliced chicken and the halved sun-dried tomatoes

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato chicken pasta

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato chicken pasta and sprinkle with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
