### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Chop your tomatoes into wedges

Add the tomato and onion wedges to the dish with a generous pinch of salt

### Step 4

Crush your garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

### Step 5

Add the crushed garlic and cardamom pods to the dish with your ground turmeric, ground coriander, curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your vegetable stock mix, chopped tomatoes, a pinch of sugar and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 30 min – this is your curry sauce

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once the curry sauce has had 30 min, add your naan[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Chop any larger sized haddock bites into bite-sized pieces

### Step 7

Remove the dish from the oven and top the curry sauce with your haddock bites

Return the dish to the oven, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Once the fish is cooked through, discard the cardamom pods – this is your one-pot haddock rogan josh

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot haddock rogan josh with the warmed naan[s] to the side

Tear your coriander leaves and dollop your natural yoghurt over the top of the haddock rogan josh

Dig in!
