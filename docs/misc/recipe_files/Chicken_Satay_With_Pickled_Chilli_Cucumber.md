## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your cucumber finely


### Step 4

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of sugar and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled chilli cucumber


### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> boiled water

Once dissolved, add your peanut butter, soy sauce and red chilli relish and give everything a good mix up – this is your peanut sauce


### Step 6

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate your grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Add the peanut sauce to the pan, then reduce the heat to medium-high, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce is starting to thicken – this is your chicken satay

### Step 8

Serve the cooked brown rice and top with the chicken satay

Serve the quick-pickled chilli cucumber to the side

Enjoy!
