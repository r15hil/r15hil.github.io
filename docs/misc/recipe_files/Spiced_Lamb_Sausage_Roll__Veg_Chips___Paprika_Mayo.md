## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 250g British lamb mince
- 20g rocket
- 160g puff pastry
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 white potato
- 2 carrots
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 15ml white wine vinegar

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Top, tail, peel and chop the carrots into chips, then cut the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (skins on)  into similar sized chips

Add the carrot and potato chips to a baking tray with a little vegetable oil, half the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min


### Step 2

While the vegetable chips are cooking, combine the lamb mince, ras el hanout, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a generous pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your spiced lamb mix


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> rectangles and add them to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Add the spiced lamb mix into the centre of the pastry rectangles, lengthways in a sausage shape

Press the meat down a little with your fingers to flatten it slightly


### Step 4

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the meat with as little air trapped inside as possible

Crimp and seal the edges with a fork – these are your spiced lamb sausage rolls


### Step 5

Top the spiced lamb sausage rolls with the cumin seeds

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the lamb is cooked through and the pastry is puffed up and golden


### Step 6

Combine the mayo with the remaining smoked paprika, half the white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your paprika mayo


### Step 7

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar with a little olive oil, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to the dressing, then give everything a good mix up – this is your rocket salad

### Step 8

Serve the spiced lamb sausage roll with the roasted veg chips, rocket salad and paprika mayo to the side

Enjoy!
