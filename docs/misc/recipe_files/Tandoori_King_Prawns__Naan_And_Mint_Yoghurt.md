### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Combine your curry powder, ground paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1/4 of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your tandoori marinade

### Step 3

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the tandoori marinade and give everything a good mix up until the prawns are fully coated

Set aside until later

### Step 4

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 5

While the naan[s] are in the toaster, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Add the chopped tomatoes and sliced cucumber to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato & cucumber salad

### Step 6

Combine the remaining natural yoghurt with your mint sauce – this is your mint yoghurt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1653.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once hot, add the marinated tandoori prawns and any remaining tandoori marinade from the bowl to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your tandoori king prawns

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

While the prawns are cooking, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the warmed naan with the tandoori king prawns, tomato & cucumber salad and mint yoghurt on top

Garnish with your nigella seeds and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
