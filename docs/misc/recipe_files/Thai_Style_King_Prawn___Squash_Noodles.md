### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash cubes are fork-tender

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your rice noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-8 min or until tender

Once done, drain, stir through a drizzle of vegetable oil and set aside

Tip: The oil will stop the noodles from sticking together!

### Step 4

Whilst the noodles are cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water with your creamed coconut – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 6

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the coconut stock and butternut squash cubes

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 7

Whilst the prawns are cooking, chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!)

Add the chopped coriander, rice vinegar and lime leaf[ves] to the pan and mix everything together – these are your Thai-style king prawns & squash

### Step 8

Serve the rice noodles in bowls and top with the Thai-style king prawns & squash

Sprinkle over your crispy onions and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
