## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel half your red onion[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and slice<span class="text-danger"> </span>into thin rings

Add the onion rings to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until crisp


### Step 3

While the chips are in the oven, peel and grate the remaining red onion[s]

Add the grated onion, your panko breadcrumbs and lean beef mince to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 1 lean beef burger patty per person

Add the lean beef burger patty[ies] to a separate, lightly oiled baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the lean beef burger patties are cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your mint finely, discard the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your red chilli[es] finely


### Step 5

Add the chopped parsley and mint to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and a small splash of cold water

Grind the mix to a paste, then add your mayo, chopped garlic, chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> of your red wine vinegar from the quick-pickled onion – this is your chimichurri mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) (or griddle if you have one), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Do this is in batches!

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Once the lean beef burger patty is cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top them with the grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy lean beef burger patty[ies]

Meanwhile, separate your lettuce into leaves, then wash them thoroughly and pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To build, top each toasted brioche base with a few lettuce leaves, a cheesy lean beef burger patty, some quick-pickled onion, a dollop of chimichurri mayo and the toasted brioche lid – this is your cheesy lean beef burger

Serve the chips, any remaining lettuce leaves and remaining chimichurri mayo to the side, then top the lettuce leaves with any remaining quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!
