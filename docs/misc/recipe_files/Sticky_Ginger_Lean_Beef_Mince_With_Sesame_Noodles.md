### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water until fully submerged and stir for 10 secs until the noodles separate

Set aside to soak for 4 min, or until the noodles have softened, then drain and return them to the bowl

### Step 4

While the noodles are soaking, slice your red chilli[es] finely

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

### Step 5

Add half of the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan with your sugar snap peas and ginger paste and cook for 2 min further or until the lean beef mince has started to brown

### Step 6

Add your soy sauce, red chilli relish and rice vinegar to the pan and cook for 2 min further or until sticky and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky ginger lean beef mince

### Step 7

Season the softened noodles with a pinch of salt and stir through your toasted sesame oil – these are your sesame noodles

### Step 8

Serve the sticky ginger lean beef mince over the sesame noodles

Garnish with the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and reserved sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
