## Description

Falafel are patties, soft in the middle but crunchy on the outside, made from blitzed chickpeas, herbs and spices. Instead of deep-frying, you'll oven bake these ones and serve them with a cucumber & feta salad, herby bulgur and tahini yoghurt with crispy pitta to scoop it all up. Sure to fala-fill you up!

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Peel and roughly chop 2/3 of the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then slice the rest (as finely as you can!)


Peel and roughly chop the garlic


Drain and rinse the chickpeas


Roughly chop the parsley and cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges

### Step 2

Add the drained chickpeas to a food processor with the ground cumin, chopped red onion, chopped garlic and the juice of 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> lemon wedges


Add half the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!) with half the sesame seeds, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt 


Pulse until everything is blitzed but not smooth – this is your falafel mix

### Step 3

Boil a kettle


Line a baking tray with baking paper, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds


Shape the falafel mix into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> falafel balls


Add the falafel balls to the baking tray and press them gently into the sesame seeds


Drizzle generously with olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden brown

### Step 4

While the falafel balls are in the oven, add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, cook for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


Combine the tahini with the natural yoghurt and the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>– this is your tahini yoghurt


Tip: Add everything to the yoghurt pot to save on washing up!

### Step 5

Cut the wholemeal pitta into triangles 


Add the pitta triangles to the tray with the falafel (or a separate one!) and return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until the pitta is golden and crunchy

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely


Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


Chop the feta into small bite-sized pieces 


Combine the chopped cucumber, sliced red onion, chopped feta and half the chopped mint with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl – this is your cucumber salad

### Step 7

Add the reserved chopped parsley and mint to the cooked bulgur wheat with the juice of the remaining lemon 


Give everything a good mix up – this is your herby bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the falafel with the herby bulgur, cucumber salad and crunchy pitta to the side


Dollop with the tahini yoghurt


Enjoy!
