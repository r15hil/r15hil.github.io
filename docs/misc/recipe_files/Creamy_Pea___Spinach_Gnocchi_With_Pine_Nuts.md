## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from the stems, discard the stems

Add half your blanched peas and half your pine nuts (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with your creamy single soy and mint leaves

Blitz until smooth – this is your creamy pea & mint sauce


### Step 4

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 5

Once the gnocchi is beginning to crisp, add your roasted garlic paste to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the creamy pea & mint sauce to the pan with your vegetable stock mix and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and add it to the pan with the remaining blanched peas and the juice of half the lemon[s]

Season with a grind of black pepper and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your creamy pea & spinach gnocchi

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your rocket and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the creamy pea & spinach gnocchi with the rocket to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining pine nuts and garnish with a lemon wedge

Drizzle over a little olive oil

Enjoy!
