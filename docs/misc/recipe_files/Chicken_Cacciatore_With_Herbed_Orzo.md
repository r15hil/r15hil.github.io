## Ingredients

- 1 tomato paste sachet (16g)
- 320g British chicken thighs, skin on
- 3 dried bay leaves
- 1 can of chopped tomatoes (210g)
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 10g rosemary & thyme mix
- 1 carrot
- 150g orzo pasta
- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 Knorr chicken stock cube
- 5g parsley
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle then pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen roll and season the skin generously with salt


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skin is golden and crispy (you'll finish cooking them later!)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Top, tail and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skins on)


Chop the chestnut mushrooms roughly


Peel and finely chop the garlic


### Step 3

Once the chicken skin is crispy, transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside for later and return the <span class="text-highlight">pan and oil to a m</span>edium heat


Add the chopped onion, carrot, garlic, mushrooms, rosemary &amp; thyme sprigs and bay leaves with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


Tip: Add a drizzle of olive oil if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have softened, add the balsamic vinegar, tomato paste and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 30 sec or until fragrant


<span class="text-highlight">Add the chopped tomatoes, chicken stock and the chicken thighs (skin-side up) to the pan and cook for 8-10 min further (no pink meat!)</span> or until the sauce has thickened to a rich stew-like consistency – this is your chicken cacciatore


Tip: Keep the chicken skin above the sauce to keep them crispy


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the orzo pasta to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">Italians say the water should be as salty as the sea!</span>


Cook the orzo for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the orzo


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


Add a knob of butter and most of the chopped parsley to the drained orzo and season with a pinch of salt – this is your herbed orzo

### Step 8

Remove the rosemary, thyme and bay leaves from the stew and discard


Serve the chicken cacciatore with the herbed orzo to the side


Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley
