## Ingredients

- Gem lettuce x2
- Wholewheat noodle nest
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Smooth peanut butter (26g)
- Carrot
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Lime
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles


### Step 2

While the noodles are soaking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Once the onion is starting to soften, push it to one side of the pan and increase the heat to medium-high, then add your free range chicken breast portion[s]

Cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once browned add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, separate 6 outer lettuce leaves per person, wash and dry with kitchen paper and shred the inner core[s] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Grate your carrot[s]


### Step 6

Combine your peanut butter, red chilli relish, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a bowl

Add your soy sauce and the juice of half your lime[s] and stir it all together – this is your satay sauce

Cut the remaining lime into wedges


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the shredded chicken, cooked onion, grated carrot, shredded lettuce, chopped mint , chopped coriander and satay sauce to the pan with the drained noodles

Give everything a good mix up – this is your free range chicken satay noodle filling

### Step 8

Divide the free range chicken satay noodle filling between the lettuce leaves

Garnish with your sesame seeds and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
