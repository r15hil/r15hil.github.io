Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with your dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

### Step 4

Whilst the bulgur wheat is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> [1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Add the sliced onion, shredded kale and drained lentils to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until everything has softened

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until the butternut squash is tender and the broccoli is crispy

### Step 7

Once the butternut squash and broccoli are done, add your pumpkin seeds to the tray[s] and return to the oven for a further 2-3 min or until the seeds are toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Whilst the seeds are toasting, add the cooked bulgur wheat to the pan with the softened kale, lentils and onion and stir it all together – these are your grains

### Step 8

Serve the roasted butternut squash and Tenderstem broccoli over the grains

Drizzle over the miso dressing

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds
