### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries, then toss them in a bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Transfer the fries to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until they're cooked through and crisp

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your soy sauce and the chopped garlic to the pan with a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways until you have thin strips

Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

### Step 5

Combine your mayo and red chilli relish in a bowl – this is your chilli mayo

### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mix the pulled free range chicken into the pan juices

### Step 8

To assemble, spread the chilli mayo over the toasted brioche base, top with the pulled free range chicken, crispy onions, cucumber matchsticks and spring onion strips and top with the toasted brioche lid – this is your Asian-style free range chicken burger

Serve the fries topped with your toasted sesame seeds to the side, alongside any remaining chilli mayo, cucumber matchsticks and spring onion strips

Enjoy!
