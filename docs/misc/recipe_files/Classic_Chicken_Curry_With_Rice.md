## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, ground turmeric and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min further or until the chicken is coated in all of the spices


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and a pinch of sugar in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Add the tomato stock, chopped tomato and a pinch of pepper to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your natural yoghurt

Mix until fully combined – this is your classic chicken curry

### Step 8

Serve the classic chicken curry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
