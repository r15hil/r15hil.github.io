## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- White potato x3
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Smooth peanut butter (26g)
- Soy sauce (8ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with your toasted sesame seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your sesame chips


### Step 2

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness


### Step 3

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add your brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving, reserve the pan


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the flattened chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with your mayo, the juice of half your lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar – this is your lime slaw


### Step 6

Combine your peanut butter and soy sauce in a bowl with your red chilli relish and the juice of the remaining lime

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water and stir it all together – this is your satay sauce


### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to the bowl with the satay sauce and toss until the chicken is fully coated – this is your peanut satay chicken

### Step 8

To build your burger, add a spoonful of lime slaw to the toasted brioche base, then top with the peanut satay chicken, spooning over any remaining satay sauce and the toasted brioche lid – this is your peanut satay chicken burger

Serve the peanut satay chicken burger with the sesame chips and remaining lime slaw to the side

Enjoy!
