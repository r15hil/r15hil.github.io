## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on)


### Step 2

Top, tail and peel half of your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into a pile of ribbons, then grate the remaining carrot

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and chop your shallot[s]


### Step 3

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate and season with salt and pepper, then add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Boil half a kettle

Wash your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper then shred roughly


### Step 4

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and slice through the thickest part of the chicken being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side, then open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

Coat the butterflied chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated carrot, chopped ginger and chopped shallot and cook for 3 min

Add your curry powder and cook for a further 2 min

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the vegetables evenly


### Step 6

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to low

Add your soy sauce and stir through your mango chutney

Cook for 5-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Season with a generous pinch of salt, cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu sauce


### Step 7

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 7-8 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Combine your rice vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your dressing

### Step 8

Add the shredded lettuce and carrot ribbons to the bowl with the dressing and give it a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

On a clean board, slice the breaded chicken finely into strips

Spoon the katsu sauce onto the plate and serve the sliced breaded chicken over the sauce with the cooked rice and salad to the side

Enjoy!
