## Ingredients

- 11g beef stock mix
- 32g tomato paste
- 130g brown rice
- 400g canned red kidney beans
- 40g cheddar flavour block
- 40g chipotle paste
- 250g British pork mince
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 spring onions
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C /220°C (fan) / gas 9 and boil a kettle

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until slightly softened


### Step 3

While the onion softens, drain and rinse the red kidney beans, reserving the liquid

Add half of the drained kidney beans to a baking tray (you'll use the rest later!)

Drizzle them with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the skins have burst and are crispy – these are your popped beans


### Step 4

While the kidney beans are in the oven, dissolve the beef stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Add the ground cinnamon to the red onion and cook for 1 min


### Step 5

Increase the heat to medium-high, add the the pork mince to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Add the tomato paste and chipotle paste to the pan

Cook for 1 min, then add the beef stock and a large pinch of sugar

Cook for 10 min or until slightly thickened in consistency

Add the remaining kidney beans with the reserved kidney bean liquid and cook for a further 5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a chilli-like consistency – this is your smoky pork chilli


### Step 7

While the chilli is cooking, trim, then slice the spring onions finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Grate the cheddar flavour block

Once the rice is cooked, mix through the sliced spring onion and chopped coriander – this is your herby rice

### Step 8

Serve the smoky pork chilli over the herby rice

Garnish with the popped beans and grated cheddar flavour block

Enjoy!
