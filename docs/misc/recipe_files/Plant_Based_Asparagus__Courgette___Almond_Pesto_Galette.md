## Ingredients

- Living lettuce
- Lemon
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Basil (5g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Courgette
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Asparagus spears (120g)
- Spinach (80g)
- Ground almonds (25g)
- Basil (10g)
- Chopped dates (30g)
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/gas 7

Boil a kettle

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins


### Step 2

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool, and once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can – this is your blanched spinach


### Step 3

Add the blanched spinach and half the peeled garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with your basil, ground almonds and the juice of half your lemon[s]

Add a very generous pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of olive oil and blitz until smooth – this is your almond pesto


### Step 4

Chop (or grate) your remaining garlic finely

Combine the grated garlic with your tomato paste in a bowl with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato sauce

Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons, then dice the remaining inner stem[s]

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus


### Step 5

Line the baking tray[s] with baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to the tray[s] and prick it all over with a fork (this will stop it getting a soggy bottom!)

Spread the tomato sauce over the pastry, leaving a 2cm round border


### Step 6

Top with the courgette ribbons and diced courgette, then spread over the almond pesto

Lay the asparagus top to tail over the pesto and season with a pinch of salt and pepper then twist the pastry border over the edge of the filling (start from one corner and work around in one direction, overlapping the pastry each time)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your asparagus, courgette & almond pesto galette


### Step 7

Meanwhile, remove the base of your lettuce

Wash the lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper, and tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves

Combine the juice of the remaining lemon in a bowl with a little drizzle of olive oil and your chopped dates – this is your lemon & date vinaigrette

### Step 8

Cut the asparagus, courgette & almond pesto galette in half

Serve the halved asparagus, courgette & almond pesto galette with the lettuce leaves to the side and top with the lemon & date vinaigrette

Enjoy!
