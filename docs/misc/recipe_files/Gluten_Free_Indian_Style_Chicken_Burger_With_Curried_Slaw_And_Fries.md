- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Mango chutney (20g)

- British chicken breast portion x0
- Garam masala (1tsp)
- Gluten free brioche buns (2pcs)

- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your paprika fries


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a bowl with your ground cumin, garam masala and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Once browned, transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken


### Step 5

Combine your mango chutney and half of your mayo (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo


### Step 6

Slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half

Wipe the reserved pan, then return it to a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving


### Step 7

Add your white wine vinegar to a bowl with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> sugar<span class="text-danger"> </span>and mix until dissolved

Stir in your curry powder and remaining mayo

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your curried slaw

### Step 8

Top your toasted brioche base with a dollop of mango mayo, the spiced chicken, a handful of curried slaw and the toasted brioche lid – this is your Indian-style chicken burger

Serve the paprika fries and remaining curried slaw to the side

Enjoy!
