Add your salmon fillet[s] to a bowl with half your five-spice mix (save the rest for later!), a pinch of sugar and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and once hot, add the salmon fillet[s] (skin-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until the skin is crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips

Trim and chop your green beans and Tenderstem broccoli in half

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Once the skin is crispy, transfer the salmon to a baking tray (skin-side up), reserving the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until cooked through – this is your crispy five-spice salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Add your fine egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 5

Combine your black bean paste, cornflour and remaining five-spice mix in a small bowl

Add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and toasted sesame oil with 50ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span>[100ml] </span>cold water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and mix it all together – this is your black bean sauce


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper, green beans and Tenderstem broccoli and cook for 3-4 min or until the vegetables are starting to soften


### Step 7

Once the vegetables have started to soften, stir through the drained noodles and the black bean sauce and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce has warmed through – these are your black bean noodles

### Step 8

Serve the crispy five-spice salmon with the black bean noodles to the side

Enjoy!
