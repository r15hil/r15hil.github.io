### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the pack it and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a final 2-3 min or until the pitta is warmed through

Cut the warmed pitta in half and fill with the cooked chicken, quick-pickled onion salad and some of the garlic mayo – this is your chicken breast shawarma pitta

Serve the chicken breast shawarma pitta with the fries, remaining quick-pickled onion salad and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
