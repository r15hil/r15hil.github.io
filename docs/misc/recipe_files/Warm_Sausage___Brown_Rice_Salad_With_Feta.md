### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and your bay leaf[ves] and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it’s tender with a slight bite, then drain, return it to the pot, discard the bay leaf[ves] and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins and roots on (this helps them cook quicker)

Add your sausages and onion wedges to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a little olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion is tender

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Slice your apple[s] finely, discard the core[s] then chop into matchsticks

Once done, carefully cut off the root and remove the skins from the roast onion

Add the cooled brown rice and salad to the bowl of dressing with the sliced radishes, apple matchsticks and roast onion and toss

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your brown rice salad
