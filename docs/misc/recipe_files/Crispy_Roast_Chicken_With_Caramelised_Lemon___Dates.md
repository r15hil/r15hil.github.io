### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped, then transfer your crispy chicken to a plate, reserving the pan

### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, dried thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your thyme roasties

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your lemon[s] in half, then peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lemon halves (cut-side down) and sliced shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until the lemon has caramelised

Once caramelised, transfer the caramelised lemon halves to a plate and set aside for later

Go easy!) and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water

Bring to the boil and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened slightly – this is your date gravy

### Step 6

Once crisped, transfer the crispy chicken (skin side up) and date gravy to an oven-proof dish with the reserved lemon halves

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy roast chicken with caramelised lemon & dates

### Step 7

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite

### Step 8

Serve the crispy roast chicken with caramelised lemon & dates with the thyme roasties and Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Enjoy!
