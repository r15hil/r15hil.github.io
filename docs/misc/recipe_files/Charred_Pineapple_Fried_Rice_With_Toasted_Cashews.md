### Step 1

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then add it to a pot with your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, transfer it to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down – this is your coconut rice

### Step 2

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice half your red chilli[es] finely into rounds

Cut the remaining red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 3

Drain your pineapple, reserving the pineapple juice

Combine the chopped garlic and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>pineapple juice in a bowl with your tamari soy sauce and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy)

Add the juice of half your lime[s], 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your pineapple glaze

Add<span class="text-danger"> </span>pineapple rings for per person (save the rest for later!) to the pineapple glaze

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the glazed pineapple rings (reserving the glaze) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until lightly charred

Once lightly charred, add your cashew nuts to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until lightly toasted – this is your charred pineapple & cashew nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 5

Once lightly toasted, transfer the charred pineapple & cashew nuts to a plate and reserve the pan

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then chop your greens beans in half

Chop the remaining pineapple into bite-sized pieces

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, grated carrot, halved green beans and chopped pineapple and cook for 3-4 min or until the veg has softened

Once softened, add your ground turmeric and curry powder to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the cooled coconut rice, the reserved pineapple glaze and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the rice is warmed through – this is your fried rice

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] finely

Cut the remaining lime[s] into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the charred pineapple on top of the fried rice

Garnish with the chopped spring onion, chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and toasted cashew nuts

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
