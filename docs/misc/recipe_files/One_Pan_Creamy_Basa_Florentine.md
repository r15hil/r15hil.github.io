## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock to the pan with the softened onion


### Step 4

Add your soft cheese and orzo to the pan and give everything a good mix up until fully combined, then cook for 5 min

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop the orzo sticking to the pan!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop it roughly

Tear your basil leaves, discard the stems

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Add the chopped spinach and halved tomatoes to the orzo with half the torn basil leaves (save the rest for later!) and cook until the spinach has wilted

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spinach & tomato orzo


### Step 7

Meanwhile, season your basa with a pinch of salt and pepper

Lay the basa fillet[s] over the spinach & tomato orzo, top with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your one pan creamy basa florentine

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily!

### Step 8

Serve the one pan creamy basa florentine and garnish with the remaining torn basil

Enjoy!
