## Instructions


### Step 1

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice into small cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) your ginger


### Step 4

Add the onion wedges and peeled garlic to a food processor with the peeled ginger, tomato paste, curry powder, creamed coconut and most of your coriander (save some leaves for garnish!)

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your masala curry paste


### Step 5

Boil half a kettle and drain your sweetcorn

Once the pepper has slightly softened, add the masala curry paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water with the vegetable stock mix and drained sweetcorn

Cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your curry


### Step 6

Once the rice is ready, stir through your sultanas with a generous pinch of salt – this is your sultana rice


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the curry has thickened, add the spinach and cook for 1 min further or until the spinach has wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, remove the pan from the heat and stir through half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later) – this is your sweetcorn & pepper masala curry

### Step 8

Serve the sweetcorn & pepper masala curry with the sultana rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Drizzle over the remaining yoghurt and garnish with the reserved coriander

Enjoy!
