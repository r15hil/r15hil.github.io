Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the bacon is browning, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Boil a full kettle

Once the bacon is crisp, add the sliced leek to the pan

Stir the chicken stock into the rice and season with a grind of black pepper – this is your rice mixture

Transfer the rice mixture to an oven-proof dish (or casserole dish!)

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the rice is cooked – this is your baked risotto


### Step 6

Stir in your blanched peas

Return the dish to the oven for 5 min to warm through

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper
