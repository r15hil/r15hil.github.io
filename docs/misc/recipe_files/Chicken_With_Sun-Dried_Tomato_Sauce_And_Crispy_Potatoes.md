### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Crush your garlic cloves by pressing them down with the side of a knife (skins on!)

### Step 3

Add the chicken breasts portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped potatoes, crushed garlic and rosemary leaves

Season everything with a pinch of salt and pepper, drizzle with vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

### Step 4

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

### Step 5

Once the chicken has been cooking for 20 min, trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot and cover until serving

### Step 6

While the beans are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1 min

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1612438488318-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Stir in your soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your sun-dried tomato sauce

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced chicken over the sun-dried tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes, roasted garlic (watch out for the skins!) and green beans to the side

Enjoy!
