## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Red onion
- Proper Porker sausages (3pcs) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Proper Porker sausages (6pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Sweet pointed pepper
- Rocket (50g)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 10 min or until just fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins and roots on (this helps them cook quicker)


### Step 4

Add the pepper strips, onion wedges and your sausages to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the drained potatoes to another baking tray and crush them gently with a fork

Add your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your crispy paprika potatoes


### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and your white wine vinegar in a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your aioli


### Step 7

Once done, slice the cooked sausages diagonally into pieces

Carefully cut off the roots and remove the skins from the roasted onion wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and divide it between your serving plates

### Step 8

Serve the sliced sausages, charred pepper strips and roasted onion wedges over the salad

Sprinkle over the crispy paprika potatoes – this is your Spanish-style sausage salad with crispy paprika potatoes

Drizzle the aioli all over

Enjoy!
