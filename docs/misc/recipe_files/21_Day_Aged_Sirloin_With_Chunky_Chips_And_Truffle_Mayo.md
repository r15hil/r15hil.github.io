- British sirloin steak (200g) x0
- Red potato x4
- Tenderstem broccoli (160g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g) x0
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Red chilli

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel your red potatoes and cut them into chunky chips


### Step 2

Add the chunky chips to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min or until part-cooked

Once done, drain and lay the chunky chips flat on a baking tray (or two!) to steam dry

Tip: For extra crispy chips, carefully shake them around in a colander to fluff up the edges a little before baking


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Deseed your red chilli[es] (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice into rounds


### Step 4

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the chunky chips, season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy, turning once halfway through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your mayo with your truffle oil and a pinch of pepper in a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your truffle mayo

Pat your sirloin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, rub them with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 6

Once the chunky chips have been cooking for 15 min, heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the seasoned sirloin steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium heat and add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan's looking a little dry

Once hot, add the sliced garlic, sliced shallot and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Add your Tenderstem broccoli, season with a pinch of salt and add a splash of boiled water, then cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until tender – this is your spicy Tenderstem broccoli

### Step 8

Serve the rested sirloin steak with the chunky chips, spicy Tenderstem broccoli and truffle mayo to the side

Enjoy!
