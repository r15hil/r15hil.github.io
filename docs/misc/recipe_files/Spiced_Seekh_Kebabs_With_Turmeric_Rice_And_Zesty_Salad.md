## Description

The classic Seekh (pronounced 'Sheek') Kebab is an Indian staple. Traditionally the kebabs are cooked over coals, but this quick version uses the grill, so your delicately spiced kebabs will char lightly on the outside, but stay fabulously succulent inside. Served with turmeric rice and a side salad.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high, then add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water, your ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, soak your skewers in cold water to prevent them from burning

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Combine your beef mince and half the chopped mint (save the rest for later!) in a large bowl with the chopped shallot, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garam masala and a small pinch of sugar

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your kebab mixture


### Step 4

Divide the kebab mixture and shape onto the skewers into 2 sausage-shaped kebabs per person

Tip: Once the kebabs are on the skewers, roll, like you would a rolling pin, to help form the sausage shape


### Step 5

Place the kebabs on a tin foil-lined baking tray, put the tray under the grill and cook for 4-5 min on each side until nicely charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your spiced seekh kebabs


### Step 6

Whilst the kebabs are cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred

Dice your tomato[es]

Combine the juice of half your lime[s] in a large mixing bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the shredded lettuce and diced tomato and mix it all together – this is your zesty salad


### Step 7

Combine your natural yoghurt and remaining chopped mint in a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your mint yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the spiced seekh kebabs over the turmeric rice with the zesty salad to the side

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
