## Ingredients

- 120g black olives
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 1 sweet pointed pepper
- 1 courgette
- 20g capers
- 2 x 110g skin on salmon fillets
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small bite-sized pieces

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Slice the black olives in half

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters


### Step 3

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper

Divide the capers, chopped courgette, pepper strips, halved cherry tomatoes and black olives between the sheets and add them to a baking tray

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 4

Lay the salmon, skin-side down, over the vegetables and season with a pinch of salt

Add a lemon wedge to each parcel (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 5

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the fish to form a sealed parcel

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the fish is cooked – this is your Mediterranean-style salmon en papillote

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the waxy potatoes into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain and return them to the pot

Add the juice of the remaining lemon, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your dressed potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the Mediterranean-style salmon en papillote with the dressed potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
