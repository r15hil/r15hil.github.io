## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 160g blanched peas
- 160g quick cook spaghetti
- 250g British diced chicken breast
- 1/2 Knorr chicken stock cube
- 5g parsley
- 1 pot of Cornish clotted cream (40g)
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin... 

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken with a pinch of salt and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 4

Re-boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Add the chicken stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Whilst the chicken is cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

Slice the remaining 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wedges

Finely chop the parsley (including the stalks)


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the clotted cream, peas and half the grated cheddar cheese and cook for 1 min or until everything is warmed through

Add the drained spaghetti and chopped parsley to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony chicken & pea spaghetti

### Step 8

Serve the lemony chicken & pea spaghetti with a generous grind of black pepper

Sprinkle over the remaining grated cheddar cheese and top with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!
