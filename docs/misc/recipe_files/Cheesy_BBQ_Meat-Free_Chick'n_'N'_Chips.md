### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a grind of black pepper

Add your meat-free chick'n to the plate and turn them several times in the spices until they’re nicely coated

### Step 5

Transfer the browned meat-free chick'n to a tin foil-lined baking tray and scrunch the edges of the foil up a little around it

Tip: This will help to keep the sauce around your meat-free chick'n!

Drizzle your smoky BBQ sauce all over and put the tray in the oven for an initial 5 min

While everything's cooking, combine your white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

After 5 min, remove the meat-free chick'n tray from the oven and sprinkle over the grated cheese
