## Ingredients

- Cannellini beans (185g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Ciabatta
- British free range egg x2
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Rocket (20g)
- Tomato
- White potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt


### Step 2

Add your sausages to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the chips are golden and crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened, then remove from the heat and set aside for later – these are your homemade beans


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] in half

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 5

Once the sausages and chips have had 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and tomato halves and cook for 3 min on one side, then flip everything and cook for 3 min further

Transfer the softened mushrooms to the tray[s] in the oven alongside the chips and sausages to keep warm


### Step 6

Return the pan with the tomato halves to a medium-low heat and add another knob of butter

Crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomato has softened and the egg is done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, reheat the homemade beans over a medium-high heat

Add the ciabatta[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Spread the toasted ciabatta with butter and chop into triangles

### Step 8

Serve the sausages, homemade beans, mushrooms, chips and tomato with a fried egg, the buttery toasted ciabatta triangles and salad to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
