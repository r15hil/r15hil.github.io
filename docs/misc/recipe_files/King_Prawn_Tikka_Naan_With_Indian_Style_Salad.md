### Step 5

Once hot, add the marinated king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally until golden and cooked through – this is your king prawn tikka

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then dice roughly

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the diced cucumber and grated carrot to a bowl with your nigella seeds, a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Indian-style salad

### Step 7

Combine the remaining natural yoghurt with your mint sauce in a small bowl – this is your mint yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the warmed naan[s] topped with the king prawn tikka and Indian-style salad

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt and garnish with the remaining lemon quarters

Enjoy!
