### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small cubes, then add the potato cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half of the dried sage (you’ll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 10 min

Peel and chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Add a large knob of butter to a bowl with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water

Once the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot, panko breadcrumbs and the remaining dried sage

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and set aside to absorb – this is your stuffing mix
