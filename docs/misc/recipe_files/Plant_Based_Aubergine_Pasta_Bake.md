## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and top, tail and slice lengthways

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add the sliced aubergine and halved cherry tomatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tomatoes have started to blister

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

While the veg is roasting, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

While the onion is softening, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water and add your tomato paste, finely chopped tomatoes and balsamic vinegar – this is your tomato stock

Once the onion has softened, add the dried oregano and tomato stock to the pan with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and stir it all together, then add your macaroni, tear in your basil and cook for 2-3 min – this is your tomato macaroni


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your panko breadcrumbs and flaked almonds in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your almond crumb


### Step 6

Add a big spoonful of the tomato macaroni to an oven-proof dish, then top with some of the roasted veg

Repeat this layering process until you have used all of the roasted veg and tomato macaroni


### Step 7

Tear your cheese flavour slice[s] evenly over the top, then sprinkle the almond crumb all over

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the crumb is golden and the macaroni is cooked – this is your plant-based aubergine pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based aubergine pasta bake

Enjoy!
