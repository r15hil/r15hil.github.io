## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Add your cashew nuts to a large baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until the cashews are lightly toasted, then transfer to a plate and reserve the tray for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Chop your parsley finely, keeping the stalks and leaves separate

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) then chop into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add your beef mince to a large bowl with the chopped spring onion, chopped dates, chopped parsley stalks, half of your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands, then divide the mixture and shape into 3 meatballs per person – these are your harissa beef meatballs


### Step 4

Add the harissa beef meatballs to one side of your reserved baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Add the chopped pepper to the other side, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pepper has softened – these are your harissa beef meatballs and roasted pepper


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a large heatproof bowl

Add your couscous, cover and set aside to soften


### Step 6

Add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Chop the toasted cashew nuts coarsely (careful they may be hot!)


### Step 7

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork, season with a grind of black pepper and mix most of the chopped parsley leaves through (save some for garnish!)

Once done, add the roasted pepper to the couscous and give it a good mix up – this is your roasted pepper couscous

### Step 8

Serve the harissa beef meatballs over the roasted pepper couscous and drizzle the seasoned yoghurt all over

Garnish with the chopped cashew nuts and reserved chopped parsley leaves

Enjoy!
