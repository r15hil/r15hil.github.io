## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into thin strips

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice finely


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, then once hot, add the chicken strips, sliced pepper, curry powder, ground paprika, ground turmeric, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Cook for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tandoori-style chicken & peppers


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add most of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with your tomato paste, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper

Add 5<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> water and give it a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce


### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the pizza base[s], then top with the tandoori-style chicken & peppers


### Step 6

Top the pizza with the torn mozzarella and then put the tray[s] into the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crispy – this is your tandoori-style free range chicken pizza

Tip: Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!


### Step 7

While the pizza is cooking, combine the remaining chopped garlic with your mayo, dried oregano, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl – this is your garlic & herb dip

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori-style free range chicken pizza with the garlic & herb dip to the side

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
