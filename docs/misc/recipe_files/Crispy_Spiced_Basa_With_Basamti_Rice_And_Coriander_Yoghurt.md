Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 3

Combine the chopped basa and soy sauce in a bowl with your ginger & garlic paste and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated basa

Add your gram flour to a separate bowl with your ground cumin and most of your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your spiced gram flour

### Step 4

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

Combine the chopped cucumber and chopped tomato in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!), the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato salad

Add the marinated basa to the bowl with the spiced gram flour and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated basa

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1672755047932-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the remaining natural yoghurt and chopped coriander with a squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander yoghurt

Cut your remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy spiced basa over the basmati rice with the tomato salad to the side

Drizzle over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
