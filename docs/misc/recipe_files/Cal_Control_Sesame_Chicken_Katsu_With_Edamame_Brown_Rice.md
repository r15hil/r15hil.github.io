## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot, then rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water, add to the pot with the rice and keep covered until serving – this is your edamame brown rice


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Sprinkle over your black sesame seeds and season with a generous pinch of salt, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sesame chicken


### Step 3

Peel half your carrot[s], until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Grate the remaining carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]


### Step 4

Heat a large pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated carrot, your ginger paste and the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add your curry powder and umami seasoning and cook for 2 min further until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour, stir it all together and cook for 1 min


### Step 5

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water to the pot and reduce the heat to low

Add your soy sauce and tomato ketchup and stir it all together

Cook for 5-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency, then blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your katsu sauce


### Step 6

Combine your rice vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your dressing

Add the carrot ribbons to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed carrot ribbons


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and slice finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced sesame chicken over the katsu sauce, with the edamame brown rice and dressed carrot ribbons to the side

Enjoy!
