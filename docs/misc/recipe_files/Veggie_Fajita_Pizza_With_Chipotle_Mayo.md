## Ingredients

- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Red pepper
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Green chilli
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then chop into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your sweetcorn

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped pepper with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and a pinch of salt

Cook for 2-3 min until the shallot has softened – this is your spicy pepper mixture


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the top of the pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with the drained sweetcorn, torn mozzarella and spicy pepper mixture


### Step 6

Sprinkle the pizza[s] with your grated cheese then top with the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – this is your veggie fajita pizza

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don’t overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!


### Step 7

While the pizza[s] is cooking, combine your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your mayo and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 8

Serve the veggie fajita pizza with the chipotle mayo to the side

Enjoy!
