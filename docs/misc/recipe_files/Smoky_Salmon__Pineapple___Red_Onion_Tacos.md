## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel your red onion[s] and slice into 1 ring per person, then dice the remaining onion

Add the onion rings and red wine vinegar to a shallow bowl and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled onion rings


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic to the softened onion and cook for 1 min further, then set aside until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and separate the outer leaves, then finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain your pineapple, then finely dice

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa


### Step 4

Chop your coriander as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and the chopped coriander in a bowl – this is your herby mayo


### Step 5

Pat your salmon fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the salmon to a bowl with your soy sauce, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix until the salmon is evenly coated – this is your coated salmon


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated salmon and and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your smoky salmon

Once the salmon is cooked through, transfer to a clean board, remove and discard the skin, then break the cooked salmon into bite-sized pieces

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Drain the quick-pickled onion rings and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Top your warmed tortillas with a dollop of herby mayo and the lettuce leaves

Fill the lettuce leaves with the softened onion, top with smoky salmon, pineapple salsa and garnish with the quick-pickled onion rings – these are your smoky salmon pineapple & red onion tacos

Enjoy!
