### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4, then boil a kettle

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs on the diagonal

Add your cherry tomatoes and sliced courgette to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until softened – this is your roasted vegetables

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your walnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer the toasted walnuts to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 7

Combine your vegan mayo and ground paprika in a small bowl and set aside for later – this is your paprika mayo

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

### Step 8

Serve your Turkish-style kisir bulgur with your roasted vegetables on top

Garnish with the toasted walnuts, chopped parsley and chopped mint

Drizzle over the paprika mayo

Enjoy!
