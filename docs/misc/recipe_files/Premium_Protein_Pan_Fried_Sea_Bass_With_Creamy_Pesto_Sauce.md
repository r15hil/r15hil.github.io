### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine kernel & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a bowl and set aside until serving, and reserve the pan – these are your toasted seeds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!
