## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Walnuts (25g)
- Pomegranate molasses (15g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)

- Rocket (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Add the halved pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the pepper has softened and browned


### Step 2

While the pepper is in the oven, grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Peel your garlic


### Step 3

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine half your pomegranate molasses in a bowl with half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous drizzle of olive oil – this is your pomegranate dressing


### Step 4

Add the peeled garlic, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), walnuts, ground cumin and ground smoked paprika to a food processor with the remaining pomegranate molasses and white wine vinegar

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil with a pinch of salt and blitz  – this is your muhammara base


### Step 5

Once ready, remove the tray[s] with the pepper from the oven

Reduce the oven temperature to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add the softened pepper to the muhammara base (reserve the tray[s]) and blitz until smooth – this is your muhammara


### Step 6

Add your pizza base[s] to the reserved tray[s]

Spread the muhammara evenly over the pizza base[s] and top with the grated cheese, torn mozzarella and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy muhammara flatbread


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the salad and toasted sesame seeds to the dressing and toss – this is your pomegranate salad

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy muhammara flatbread topped with a little of the pomegranate salad

Serve the remaining salad in a bowl

Enjoy!
