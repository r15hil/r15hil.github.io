## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced brown onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened


### Step 2

Cut your lime[s] into wedges

Add your peanut butter to a bowl with your ginger & garlic paste, soy sauce, ground cumin and the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime wedge[s] and mix until fully combined

Gradually whisk in 4 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [5 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> boiled water, a little at a time, until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your peanut sauce


### Step 3

Once the onion is slightly softened, reduce the heat to low

Add your tomato paste, ground paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and the vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your tomato spiced rice


### Step 5

Whilst the rice is cooking, cut a large piece of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper

Add your hake fillets to the middle of the foil

Pour the peanut sauce evenly over the hake fillets


### Step 6

Scrunch the edges of the foil together around the fish to form a sealed parcel

Add the parcel[s] to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the hake is cooked through – this is your West African-style peanut hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is in the oven, trim your green beans and chop in half

Add the chopped beans to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Scrunch the foil around the beans to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!), then put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the beans are tender

### Step 8

Serve the West African-style peanut hake with the spiced tomato rice and cooked green beans to the side

Spoon the remaining peanut sauce from the parcel over the hake and sprinkle with your crispy onions

Garnish with the remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!
