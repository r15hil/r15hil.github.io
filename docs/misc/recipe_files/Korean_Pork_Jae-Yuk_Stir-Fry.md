### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Whilst the rice is cooking, slice your pork loin steak[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pork with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until browned

Once browned, transfer it to a plate, set aside for later and reserve the pan

Tip: You'll finish cooking this later!

### Step 4

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into batons

Top, tail, peel and finely slice your carrot[s] on a diagonal

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Add the sliced onion, carrot rounds, courgette batons and chopped garlic to the reserved pan (keep it off the heat for now!)

Add your toasted sesame oil, gochujang paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce, a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat and cook for 10-15 min or until the vegetables have softened

Tip: Add a splash of cold water if it's starting to stick to your pan

While the vegetables are softening, add your cornflour to a bowl with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1617035308094-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the vegetables have softened, increase the heat to medium-high, add the cornflour mix and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has started to thicken

Once the sauce is starting to thicken, add the browned pork with any resting juices and cook for 3-4 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork jae-yuk stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the pork jae-yuk stir-fry over the sticky rice

Enjoy!
