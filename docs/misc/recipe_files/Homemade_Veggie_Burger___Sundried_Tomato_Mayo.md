## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 20g wild rocket
- 2 Brioche rolls
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 1 soy sauce sachet (15ml)
- 1 can of sweetcorn (198g)
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 tahini sachet (40g)
- 1 sundried tomato paste pot (30g)
- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 10g basil

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips


Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and roughly chop the garlic


Chop the basil roughly, including the stalks


Drain the sweetcorn and pat the kernels completely dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add the dried sweetcorn, chopped red onion, chopped garlic and chopped basil to a food processor with the soy sauce, ground cumin, tahini and a generous pinch of black pepper


Pulse for 2-3 secs or until the mixture is roughly chopped


### Step 4

Add the panko breadcrumbs and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-highlight">flour</span><span class="text-highlight"> </span>and pulse for 2-3 secs further or until the mixture comes together to form a dough-like consistency


Shape the mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> flat <span class="text-highlight">burger patties</span>


Tip: Add a little more flour if your mixture is too wet to handle


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat 


Once the pan is hot, add the burger patties and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden then add to a baking tray (save the pan for later)


Put the tray into the oven for 10 min or until golden


### Step 6

<span class="text-highlight">While the patties are in the oven,</span> slice the cheddar cheese into thin slices


Once golden, top each burger patty with the sliced cheese, then return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the cheese is melted and the burgers are cooked through, these are your <span class="text-highlight">cheesy burger patties</span>


### Step 7

<span class="text-highlight">Wipe</span> the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the brioche rolls, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving


Add the mayonnaise and sun-dried tomato paste to a small bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your sun-dried tomato mayo

### Step 8

Assemble your burgers with a little sun-dried tomato mayo, the <span class="text-highlight">wild rocket</span> and the cheesy burger patties


Serve the chips and any remaining sun-dried tomato mayo to the side


Enjoy!
