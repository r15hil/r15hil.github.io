## Description

Our take on Sicily's sunny caponata is full of sweet, tangy Italian flavours like sultanas, zingy capers and tender aubergine. Mix in cavolo nero for nutrient-packed greens, and serve with garlic bread for dipping. Delicioso!

## Ingredients

- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 20g capers
- 2 ciabattas
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 5g parsley
- 150g cavolo nero
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine
- 30g sultanas
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Remove 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter alternative from the fridge to soften for later

Trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut into quarters lengthways, then chop into big pieces

Peel and slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into wedges


### Step 2

Add the chopped aubergine and onion wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened and starting to brown – this is your roast veg


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and add the sultanas, capers, red wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried basil – this is your sultana stock


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the chopped tomatoes and sultana stock and cook for 10 min or until thickened – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 5

Slice the ciabattas in half

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped parsley and remaining chopped garlic with the softened butter, then spread it over the ciabatta halves and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until crusty and golden – this is your garlic bread


### Step 6

Wash the cavolo nero, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop roughly, removing any tough stalks

Melt a knob of butter alternative in a pot (with a matching lid) and add the chopped cavolo nero and a generous pinch of salt

Put the lid on and cook for 2 min or until wilted – this is your buttery cavolo nero


### Step 7

Once the tomato sauce has thickened, add your roasted veg to the pan and cook for 1 min or until well combined – this is your caponata

### Step 8

Serve the caponata alongside the buttery cavolo nero with the garlic bread to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
