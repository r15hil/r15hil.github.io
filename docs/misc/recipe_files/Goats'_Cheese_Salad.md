## Description

Our favourite new grain- freekeh is a fibre-packed superfood! Freekeh undergoes a complicated harvesting process of roasting, piling, sun-drying and thrashing to get its unique taste and texture; which is nutty with a slight grassy note.

Discard the ends, peel and cut the carrots lengthwise into long strips, then into baton sized pieces 


Peel and chop the shallots finely


Remove the woody tops from the sugar snap peas


Slice the goats' cheese in half to form circular patties (approx. 1cm thick)
