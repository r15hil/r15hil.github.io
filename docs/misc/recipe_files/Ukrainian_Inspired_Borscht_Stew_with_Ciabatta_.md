Peel and finely chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves

Top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely dice the potatoes


### Step 2

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leeks, chopped red onion and bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves] </span>with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 6-8 min or until starting to soften, then add the diced potatoes and cook for a further 1-2 min

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic, tomato paste and smoked paprika to the pan with a generous pinch of sugar

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Meanwhile, grate the beetroot


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the Kallo vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, grated beetroot, pickled red cabbage and 350ml<span class="text-danger"> [650ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 20-25 until the potatoes are cooked through

Tip: Stir the stew occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan!


### Step 5

Separate a few dill fronds for garnish

Chop the remaining dill and the chives roughly, including the stalks


### Step 6

Add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray

Once the soup is almost ready, put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until hot and crusty


### Step 7

Once the stew is done, stir through the horseradish cream (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the chopped dill and chives

Tip: Taste for seasoning, adding a pinch more salt if needed!

### Step 8
