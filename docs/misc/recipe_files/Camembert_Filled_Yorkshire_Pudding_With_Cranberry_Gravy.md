### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Combine the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with 35g <span class="text-danger">[70g]</span> flour and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your batter

Put the batter in the fridge to rest

### Step 2

Peel the potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, fill a small oven-proof dish (or two) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and put the dish<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>in the oven for an initial 8 min for the oil to heat up

While the oil is heating up, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic and top, tail, and chop the carrots into quarters lengthways, then into batons

Add the carrot batons to one side of a baking tray topped with most of the thyme (save some for garnish), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

### Step 4

After 8 min, remove the dish<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> from the oven and evenly drizzle the batter into the hot oil

Tip: Be careful – the oil may splash!

Return the dish<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> to the oven with the thyme carrots and cook for 12 min or until the batter is puffed up and golden

Tip: Don't peek! Opening the oven might make your giant Yorkie collapse!

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 5

While the Yorkshire<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and carrots are in the oven, cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the Tenderstem broccoli to the middle with a few small knobs of butter, the chopped garlic, a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1667897190179-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the giant Yorkshire<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> has had an initial 12 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with the carrots from the oven and add the Tenderstem parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the other side of the tray

Remove the dish<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> from the oven and add the camembert<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to the centre, piercing the top a few times with a sharp knife

Return both the dish<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a final 8 min or until the camembert has melted and the Tenderstem is tender with a slight bite

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1667897194788-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium heat and once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs until a paste forms

Whisk in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water with the vegetable stock mix, soy sauce and cranberry sauce and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your cranberry gravy

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Cut the giant Yorkshire in half through the centre of the baked camembert

Serve with the mash, roasted thyme carrots and garlicky Tenderstem to the side

Drizzle the cranberry gravy over everything and sprinkle the reserved thyme leaves over the camembert

Enjoy!
