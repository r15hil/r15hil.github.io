### Step 1

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Add your cornflour, ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a plate and mix it all together

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Press the basa firmly into the seasoned flour, coating evenly on both sides – this is your coated basa


### Step 3

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel and grate your garlic

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked through once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter to a microwave-safe jug with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your buffalo sauce mix

Put the buffalo sauce mix in the microwave for 1 min or until the butter has melted, then mix until fully combined

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your buffalo sauce


### Step 6

Add your mayo to a small with the grated garlic, remaining cider vinegar, dried oregano, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style mayo


### Step 7

Add the drained sweetcorn to the cooked rice with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your spiced corn rice

### Step 8

Serve the crispy basa over the spiced corn rice with the shredded lettuce to the side

Add a small drizzle of olive oil to the shredded lettuce

Top with the buffalo sauce and ranch-style mayo and garnish with your crispy onions – this is your spicy buffalo basa rice bowl

Enjoy!
