## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes (skins on) in half, then add the halved potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the onion wedges to one half of a baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Line the other half of the baking tray[s] with baking paper


### Step 3

Slice your apple[s] finely, then chop into matchsticks (discard the core[s])

Chop your pumpkin seeds roughly


### Step 4

Combine your panko breadcrumbs, ground paprika, black sesame seeds, toasted sesame seeds and chopped pumpkin seeds in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your seeded breadcrumb mixture

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to roughly 1.5cm thick all over


### Step 5

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Coat the chicken in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it into the beaten egg and finally press it into the seeded breadcrumb mixture firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your seeded chicken


### Step 6

Add the seeded chicken to the other side of the baking tray[s] with the onion wedges

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), turning once halfway through


### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, add your mayo to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your creamy dressing

Once the seeded chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and slice into strips

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the roasted onion wedges, boiled potatoes and apple matchsticks over the salad – this is your potato salad

Top the potato salad with the sliced seeded chicken

Drizzle the creamy dressing all over

Enjoy!
