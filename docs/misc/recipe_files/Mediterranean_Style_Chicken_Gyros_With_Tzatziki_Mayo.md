### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook your food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with your soy sauce and the juice of half your lemon[s]

### Step 3

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika over the chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Mediterranean-style chicken

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Chop half your cucumber (you'll use the rest later!) into small, bite-sized pieces

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

### Step 5

Combine the diced tomato and chopped cucumber in a bowl with half the chopped parsley, half your ground sumac (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek-style salad

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard the inner seeds

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Combine your mayo and grated cucumber in a bowl with the juice of the remaining lemon, the remaining ground sumac and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tzatziki mayo

### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Dress the shredded lettuce with a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Load up the warmed naan with the Greek-style salad and Mediterranean-style chicken – this is your Mediterranean-style chicken gyros

Dollop over the tzatziki mayo and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Serve the dressed shredded lettuce to the side

Enjoy!
