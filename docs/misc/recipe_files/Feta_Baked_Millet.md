## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Strip the rosemary leaves from the stems and chop finely


Dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in 400ml <span class="text-danger">(800ml)</span> of boiled water


### Step 2

Add the millet and stock to a medium size pot


Bring to a boil with a lid, then reduce to a simmer, and cook for 20 min, or until the water is absorbed and there are holes on the surface


Meanwhile, pour the beetroot juice into a small pot for step 7


### Step 3

Cut each beetroot in half


Discard the tops and tails of the beans


Cut the pepper<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into chunky strips, discarding the seeds and pith


Peel and cut the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into chunky pieces


Peel the garlic and slice finely


### Step 4

Add the vegetables and garlic to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and half of the chopped rosemary


Tip: Group the beetroot and onion together as the beetroot's liquid keeps the onions moist whilst cooking&nbsp;


Season with salt and pepper


Oven-roast for 25-30 min, or until the vegetables are cooked and starting to char


### Step 5

Once the millet is cooked, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> (2 tbsp)</span> of butter and stir to melt


Then add 175ml <span class="text-danger">(350ml)</span> of milk and mash through


Add the remaining rosemary and crumble in half the feta, then season with pepper


### Step 6

Pour the cheesy millet into an oven proof baking dish (alternatively, use individual ones)


Put it in the oven for 5 min, or until bubbling around the sides


### Step 7

Add the reserved beetroot juice and balsamic vinegar to a small pot


Heat on a medium heat, adding a pinch of sugar (optional)


Reduce by half, then remove from the heat and add a drizzle of olive oil- this is your warm dressing&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the roast vegetables over the baked millet with the warm dressing spooned over and the remaining feta crumbled over


Enjoy!
