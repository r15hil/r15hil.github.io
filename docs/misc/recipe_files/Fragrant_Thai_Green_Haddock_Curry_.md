### Step 1

Add your lemongrass, basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and garlic

Slice your red chilli[es] in half and scrape the seeds out with a spoon, then chop your coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Add the ginger, garlic, half your red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry paste

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until softened

### Step 5

Once softened, add the Thai green curry paste to the pan with the shallot and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut  in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water, add your fish sauce along with your lime leaf[ves], the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your fragrant stock

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1598263113023-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!), chopped green beans and fragrant stock to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily) and the sauce has thickened – this is your fragrant Thai green haddock curry

Tip: Add an extra splash of water if the sauce thickens too quickly!

### Step 7

While the haddock is cooking, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Slice the remaining chilli finely

Discard any lime leaf[ves] from the curry

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant Thai green haddock curry over the lemongrass rice

Garnish with the sliceded chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
