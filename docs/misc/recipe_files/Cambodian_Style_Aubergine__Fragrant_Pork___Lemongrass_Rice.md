## Ingredients

- 40g hoisin sauce
- 0 British pork mince
- 0 white basmati rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 15ml soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 130g basmati rice
- 0 hoisin sauce
- 250g British pork mince
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk
- 5g coriander
- 1 garlic clove
- 0 soy sauce
- 2 aubergines

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 and boil half a kettle

Add your aubergine[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and add a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt


### Step 2

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until very tender

Once cooked, carefully cut a slit down the centre of each aubergine with a sharp knife, taking care not to cut all the way through – this is your roasted aubergine


### Step 3

Meanwhile, bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and set aside, then chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)


### Step 4

Add your basmati rice, the outer lemongrass layers, a generous pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large-wide based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 6-7 min or until nicely browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

While the pork is browning, combine your hoisin sauce with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>boiled water

Add your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your hoisin stock


### Step 7

Once the pork is browned, add the chopped garlic to the pan with the chopped lemongrass, chopped ginger and chopped coriander stems

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the hoisin stock, mix it all together and cook for 3-4 min or until it's reduced to a bolognese-like consistency and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fragrant pork

### Step 8

Top the roast aubergine with the fragrant pork – this is your Cambodian-style aubergine

Serve the Cambodian-style aubergine with the lemongrass rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
