## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your baking tray[s] and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then cut in half


### Step 3

Top, tail and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways, then into batons

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes, chopped parsnips and halved Brussels sprouts to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-18 min or until the potatoes are tender


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your soft cheese to a measuring jug with your dried thyme, roasted garlic paste, Chinese rice wine and vegetable stock mix

Mix until fully combined, then add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water

Stir it all together and set aside – this is your sauce

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, add the halved Tenderstem and your basa fillet[s] to the tray[s]

Tip: Nestle the basa in between the vegetables!

Top each basa fillet with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper, then return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a final 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your buttered basa & sprout tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the basa is cooked, put the sauce in the microwave for 1-2 min or until hot – this is your creamy garlic sauce

### Step 8

To serve, set the buttered basa & sprout tray bake in the middle of the table

Drizzle the creamy garlic sauce over the fish and season with a generous pinch of pepper

Dig in!
