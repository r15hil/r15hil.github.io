## Ingredients

- 200g pak choi
- 2 wholewheat noodle nests
- 8ml sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 15ml soy sauce
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 280g plain tofu
- 40g hoisin sauce
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 spring onion
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Grate the drained tofu

Add the cornflour and Chinese five-spice to a large bowl with the grated tofu and the smaller soy sauce sachet and mix it all together – this is your aromatic tofu mixture


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the aromatic tofu mixture and cook for 10 min stirring occasionally until golden and crisp

Once golden and crisp, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserving the pan – this is your crispy aromatic tofu


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with the rice vinegar, half the sesame seeds (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of sugar

Mix well and set aside to marinate – this is your sesame pickled cucumber


### Step 4

Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return them to the pot until serving


### Step 5

Combine the ginger & garlic paste and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with the hoisin sauce and the larger soy sauce sachet – this is your spicy hoisin sauce


### Step 6

Cut the pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops

Wash the white bases and green tops, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Cut the white base into bite-sized pieces and shred the green tops

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> lengthways


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pak choi bases and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Once softened, add the shredded pak choi tops and the drained noodles with the spicy hoisin sauce and give everything a good mix up until the pak choi tops have wilted – these are your hoisin noodles

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin noodles in bowls with the crispy aromatic tofu on top and the sesame pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the remaining sesame seeds and the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
