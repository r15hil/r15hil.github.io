## Ingredients

- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (30ml)
- 250g red cabbage
- 2 British duck breasts
- 20g onion marmalade
- 1 Knorr chicken stock cube
- 100g parsnips
- 300g potatoes
- 1 pot of crème fraîche (200g)
- 1 tsp five-spice mix 
- 1 soy sauce sachet (8ml) 
- 30g sultanas

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven and prepare the sauce for your gratin


Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 350°F/ Gas 4. Boil a kettle.


Dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water. 


Heat a pot over a medium heat with a small knob of butter (approx. 1 tsp).


Once melted, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 minutes or until a roux (sandy paste) has formed.


### Step 2

Build your potato &amp; parsnip gratin


Stir the chicken stock gradually into the roux and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the crème fraîche and stir well until combined. Season with a pinch of pepper and set aside.


Peel and slice the potatoes as finely as you can. Peel the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of parsnip 'ribbons'.


Layer the sliced potatoes and parsnip ribbons in an oven-proof dish and top with the sauce and grated Italian hard cheese.


Put the dish in the oven for 1 hour 10 min or until the potatoes and parsnips are golden and cooked through.


### Step 3

Slice your red cabbage


Slice approx. 250g <span class="text-danger">[500g]</span> red cabbage very finely. Use the root as a handle, and discard at the end.


### Step 4

Cook the braised red cabbage


Heat a pot (with a lid) with a knob of butter over a low heat.


Once melted, add the grated red cabbage, sultanas and red wine vinegar.


Season with a generous pinch of salt and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar.


Add 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>water and cook, covered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.


### Step 5

Render the duck breasts


Using a sharp knife, score the duck skin on a diagonal, being careful not to cut through to the meat. Season with a generous pinch of salt.


Add the scored duck, skin-side down, to a cold, dry pan over a low-medium heat.<span class="text-highlight"> Cook skin-side down only for 10-15 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crispy and the fat underneath it is rendered. </span>


Tip: by cooking this over a low-medium heat, you'll render all of the fat.


### Step 6

Roast the duck breasts


Once the potato &amp; parsnip gratin has been in for 50 min, transfer the duck, skin-side up, to a baking tray and sprinkle over the five-spice.


Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 minutes<span class="text-highlight"> if you prefer your duck cooked medium.</span> Cook for a further 3-5 minutes if you prefer your duck <span class="text-highlight">well done</span>. Once cooked, set the duck aside to rest for at least 10 minutes.


Re-boil a kettle.


### Step 7

Make your red wine jus


Pour the duck fat away (keep it in the fridge and use for roast potatoes!) and wipe the pan clean. Return the pan to a medium heat with a small knob of butter (approx. 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>) and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until a roux (sandy paste) has formed. 


Add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water, the onion marmalade and soy sauce to the roux and whisk until fully combined. 


Reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes or until a thick sauce remains – this is your sweet onion jus.

### Step 8

Serve up! 


Slice the duck breasts. Pour a pool of sweet onion jus onto each plate and top with the sliced duck.


Place a large spoonful of red cabbage alongside the duck.


Tip: any leftover cabbage will keep for a couple of days in the fridge! 


Serve the potato &amp; parsnip gratin in the baking dish for everyone to help themselves and enjoy!
