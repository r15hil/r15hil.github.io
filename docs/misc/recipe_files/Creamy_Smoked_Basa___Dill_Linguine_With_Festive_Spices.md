### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Cover with a lid and bring to the boil

### Step 3

Once the basa is cooked through, transfer it to a plate – this is your creamy smoked basa

Pour the milk from the pan into a jug (save the pan for later!) – this is your spiced milk

Tip: Keep the studded onion in the milk to allow it to infuse further
