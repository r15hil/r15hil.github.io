### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

### Step 4

Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic and your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 6

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and add your soft cheese with your chicken stock mix and reserved starchy pasta water and mix it all together

### Step 7

Add the drained tagliatelle to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy 'Nduja & red pepper sauce with fresh tagliatelle

### Step 8

Serve the creamy 'Nduja & red pepper sauce with fresh tagliatelle with the shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
