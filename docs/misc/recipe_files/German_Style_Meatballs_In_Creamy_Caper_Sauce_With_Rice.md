## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and grate the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the grated onion, beef mince, panko breadcrumbs, Dijon mustard, soy sauce and a pinch of salt and pepper to a large bowl

Massage thoroughly, with clean hands, until fully combined, then divide the mixture into 10<span class="text-danger"> [20]</span> and roll into meatballs

Tip: Massage the meat longer for more tender meatballs!


### Step 2

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 4 min, turning occasionally, until they are browned (they don't need to be fully cooked through yet!)

Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once browned, transfer the meatballs to a plate

Return the pan to a medium heat, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir until a sandy paste forms (if your pan is looking dry add a small knob of butter)

Whisk the chicken stock into the flour

Cook for 2-3 min or until it has thickened slightly


### Step 5

Once thickened, add the capers and clotted cream to the sauce

Return the meatballs to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency


### Step 6

Meanwhile, re-boil a full kettle

Chop the parsley leaves roughly, discarding the stems

Slice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


### Step 7

Remove the meatballs and sauce from the heat and  squeeze in the juice of 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> lemon wedges – these are your German meatballs

Add the shredded spring greens to a sieve and pour the kettle of boiled water over them until they have wilted slightly

### Step 8

Serve the spring greens and basmati rice with the meatballs to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
