## Ingredients

- 80g fine green beans
- 25g roasted peanuts
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 50g agave nectar
- 20g coconut flakes
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 130g basmati rice
- 30ml tamari soy sauce
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 15g tamarind paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 80g spinach
- 1 aubergine

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and chop lengthways into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> wedges

Transfer the aubergine wedges to a baking tray (or two) and toss in the toasted sesame oil (use tin foil to avoid a mess!)

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the aubergine is tender and lightly golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, combine the tamarind paste with the agave, ginger & garlic paste, 3/4 of the tamari soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky tamarind marinade


### Step 4

Crush the roasted peanuts in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don’t lose any!)

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

Combine the crushed peanuts, toasted sesame seeds and coconut flakes in a small bowl – this is your nut & seed mix


### Step 5

Once the aubergine is tender, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and coat the aubergine in the sticky tamarind marinade

Sprinkle over the nut & seed mix and return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 4-5 min further or until the nuts are golden – this is your sticky tamarind roasted aubergine

Tip: Watch the nuts like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim the green beans

Once hot, add the trimmed green beans and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown


### Step 7

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and the remaining tamari soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the green beans are starting to brown, add the spinach and the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has slightly reduced – this is your coconut veg

### Step 8

Serve the sticky tamarind roasted aubergine over the basmati rice

Serve the coconut veg to the side and drizzle any remaining coconut sauce from the pan all over

Enjoy!
