## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your red pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces

Crush half your garlic clove[s] (you'll use the rest later!) open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin


### Step 2

Cut a piece[s] of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and lay out

Add the chopped pepper to the middle with the crushed garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the pepper to form a sealed parcel[s] and add to one side of a baking tray


### Step 3

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to other side of the baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic and chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine your panko breadcrumbs in a bowl with half the chopped parsley, half your smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby breadcrumb mixture

Combine the chopped garlic and mayo in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your aioli


### Step 5

Pat the chicken breast portion[s] dry with kitchen paper, then add them to a separate, baking paper-lined baking tray, and season with a pinch of salt

Spread a dollop of the aioli on each chicken breast and sprinkle the herby breadcrumb mixture on top

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the crust is golden – this is your herb-crusted chicken


### Step 6

Once the potatoes & peppers have had an initial 15min, remove the softened peppers from the oven

Return the tray to the oven and cook your potatoes for a further 5-10 min or until golden and crisp

Meanwhile, add the softened pepper, garlic, remaining smoked paprika, flaked almonds and the juice of half your lemon[s] (save the rest for later!) to a food processor with a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until you have a coarse paste – this is your romesco sauce


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the potatoes are golden, transfer the potatoes to a pot over a medium heat with the romesco sauce, spinach and the remaining chopped parsley

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has warmed through – these are your romesco potatoes

### Step 8

Slice the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the herb-crusted chicken with the romesco potatoes and a dollop of aioli to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
