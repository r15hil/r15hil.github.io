## Ingredients

- Meatless Farm sausages (6pcs)
- Cannellini beans (185g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Ciabatta
- British free range egg x2
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- White cup mushrooms (80g)
- Tomato
- White potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt


### Step 2

Add your meat-free sausages to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the sausages are cooked through and the chips are golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the chips and meat-free sausages are cooking, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened then remove from the heat and set aside – these are your homemade beans


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] in half

Slice your white cup mushrooms finely

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 5

Once the meat-free sausages & chips have had 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and tomato halves and cook for 3 min on one side, then flip everything and cook for 3 min further

Transfer the softened mushrooms to the tray[s] in the oven to keep warm


### Step 6

Return the pan with the tomato to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomato is softened and the eggs are done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, reheat the homemade beans over a medium-high heat

Add your ciabatta halves to the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through, then spread the toasted ciabatta halves with butter and cut them into triangles

### Step 8

Serve the sausages, homemade beans, mushrooms, chips and tomato with a fried egg and the buttery toasted ciabatta triangles to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
