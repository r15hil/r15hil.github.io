Wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can, then chop it roughly

### Step 8

Drizzle the <span class="text-highlight">lamb's lettuce</span> with olive oil and <span class="text-highlight">season with</span> a pinch of salt
