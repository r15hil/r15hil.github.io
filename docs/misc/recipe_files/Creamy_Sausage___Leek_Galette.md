## Ingredients

- Sausage meat (150g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Leek
- Tomato
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 2

Whilst the sausage meat is cooking, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 3

Add the sliced leek and onion to the pan with a large pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 4-5 min or until the leek has softened

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic and dried thyme to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soft cheese and chicken stock mix and cook for 1-2 min further or until the cheese has melted and everything's combined – this is your galette filling


### Step 5

Line a baking tray (or two!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to the tray[s] and prick it all over with a fork (this will stop it getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 6

Top the pastry with the galette filling, leaving a 2cm border

Fold the pastry border over the edge of the filling

Tip: Start from one corner and work around in one direction, overlapping the pastry each time

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to make multiple galettes


### Step 7

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-17 min or until the pastry is golden, cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your creamy sausage & leek galette

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Combine your red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl with the chopped tomato and salad – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Slice the creamy sausage & leek galette

Serve a creamy sausage & leek galette slice with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
