## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken wings to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until slightly charred and cooked through

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, then remove the tough outer layer[s] and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core[s] roughly


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice with 1 lime leaf per person (you'll use the rest later!) to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your fragrant rice


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into small chunks

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Once the chicken is starting to brown, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chopped pepper and chopped lemongrass to the pan

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the pepper is slightly tender


### Step 5

Once the pepper is slightly tender, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Add your red Thai curry paste with your ground paprika and chopped coconut and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with your soy sauce, fish sauce and remaining lime leaf[ves]

Cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your red Thai chicken curry


### Step 6

While the curry is cooking, roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for a garnish!)

Combine half your red chilli relish (you'll use the rest later!) with your rice vinegar in a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add your mooli slaw mix with your chopped coriander and give everything a good mix up, then top with your chopped peanuts – this is your peanutty Thai salad


### Step 7

Once the chicken wings are ready, remove the tray from the oven and drizzle over the remaining red chilli relish and give everything a good mix up

Return the tray to the oven for 1-2 min or until the wings are sticky and glazed – these are your sweet chilli chicken wings

### Step 8

Serve the red Thai chicken curry and top with the reserved coriander leaves

Serve the fragrant rice, peanutty Thai salad and sweet chilli chicken wings to the side

Enjoy!
