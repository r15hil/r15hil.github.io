## Ingredients

- 250g THIS plant-based mince
- 100g smashed avocado
- 32g tomato paste 
- 100g brown rice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 15ml soy sauce
- 185g canned black beans
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 spring onion
- 1 pepper
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and the tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse the black beans


### Step 5

Once the onion and pepper have softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the plant-based mince with the ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until the meat-free mince is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Once the meat-free mince is browned, add the tomato stock with the drained black beans and soy sauce and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your meat-free mince chilli

Tip: If you like it more saucy add a splash more water!


### Step 7

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free mince chilli with the brown rice and smashed avocado to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
