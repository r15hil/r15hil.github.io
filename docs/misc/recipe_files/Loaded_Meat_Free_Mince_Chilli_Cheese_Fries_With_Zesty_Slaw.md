### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min

### Step 3

Add your meat-free mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar, then mix to combine – this is your spicy stock

### Step 4

Add the spicy stock to the meat-free mince

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meat-free mince is cooked through

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your meat-free mince chilli

### Step 6

Once the chips are done, push them into 1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with the meat-free mince chilli and then the grated cheese, and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Once done, set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly – these are your loaded meat-free mince chilli cheese fries

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Combine the grated carrot, shredded lettuce and zesty slaw dressing then give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty slaw

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the loaded meat-free mince chilli cheese fries with the zesty slaw to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
