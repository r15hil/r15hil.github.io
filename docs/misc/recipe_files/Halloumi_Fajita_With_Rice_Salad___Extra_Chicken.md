- Red onion
- Halloumi (200g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- British chicken breast portion
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Brown basmati rice (100g)
- Ground cumin (2tsp)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot


### Step 2

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Combine your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) on a plate – this is your fajita seasoning


### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut them into strips then peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Add the pepper strips and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with half the fajita seasoning (you'll use the rest later), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the vegetables are tender – these are your roasted vegetables


### Step 4

While the vegetables are cooking, zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and tear into bite-sized pieces, then set aside

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Combine your mayo with the lime zest, the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your lime dressing

Tip: Add a splash of water if the dressing is looking a little thick!

Slice your halloumi into thick strips, then add to the remaining fajita seasoning and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in all the spices – this is your coated halloumi


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the halloumi is slightly charred and crisp

Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and add the remaining honey – this is your halloumi fajita


### Step 7

Add the roasted vegetables, brown rice and torn lettuce to a large bowl

Add the lime dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your rice salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the halloumi fajita with the rice salad to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Serve the cooked chicken breast to the side

Enjoy!
