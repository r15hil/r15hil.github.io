## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Slice your baby button mushrooms finely

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with your dried oregano, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of pepper

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base


### Step 3

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza bases

Divide the tomato base between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon


### Step 4

Top with the sliced mushroom and bacon lardons

Tear over your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!), leaving a gap in the centre

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the bacon has started to crisp


### Step 5

While the pizzas are cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with your chopped tomatoes, Henderson’s Relish, chicken stock mix, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min or until thickened – these are your homemade beans


### Step 7

After an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully crack your egg[s] into the centre of the pizzas

Return the pizzas to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the egg whites have set but the yolk is runny and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Full English pizzas

### Step 8

Serve the Full English pizzas with the homemade beans to the side

Drizzle your ketchup all over the pizzas

Enjoy!
