## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the sweet potato wedges to a large baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the wedges are starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and cut your red onion[s] in half

Dice half the red onion[s] finely

Cut the remaining onion into wedges


### Step 4

Combine your lean pork mince and diced onion in a bowl with your five-spice mix

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Shape into 4 meatballs per person (they don't have to look perfect!) – these are your five-spice meatballs


### Step 5

Drain your pineapple (reserve the juice)

Roughly chop the drained pineapple into bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once the wedges have had an initial 10 min remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped pepper, onion wedges, chopped pineapple and the five-spice meatballs

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the wedges are golden


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour, soy sauce, tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the reserved pineapple juice in a pot

Cook over a medium heat for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your sweet & sour sauce

Once the meatballs are cooked through add the sweet & sour sauce to the tray[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky sweet & sour lean pork meatball tray bake

### Step 8

Serve the sticky sweet & sour lean pork meatball tray bake on plates and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
