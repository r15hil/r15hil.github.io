## Description

A simple summer salad with heaps of flavour! You'll make your own za'atar (a Middle Eastern spice mix of oregano, sesame seeds and sumac) to sprinkle over pan-fried halloumi. Serve with a bulgur and chickpea salad tossed with rocket, juicy orange and zingy fresh mint to balance the dish. Halloumi heaven!
