## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your tomato paste, chopped garlic, ground cumin, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 4

Add your chopped tomato, white long grain rice, sweetcorn cobettes and vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 20 min

Tip: Stir the pan occasionally to stop anything from sticking!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the rice has had 20 min, bring the heat to medium, then drain then add your king prawns (discard any excess liquid from the prawns!) to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through

Once done, taste for seasoning, adding a pinch of salt if needed – this is your Peruvian-style king prawn & rice chowder


### Step 7

Remove the cooked sweetcorn cobettes and carefully chop them in half with a sharp knife

### Step 8

Serve the Peruvian-style king prawn & rice chowder topped with the halved sweetcorn cobettes and chopped coriander

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
