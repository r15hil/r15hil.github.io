## Description

This easy, one-dish chicken dinner is like the top of a really good pizza â€“ without the dough. As the tomatoes break down, they release their juices to make a light, fragrant tomato sauce, and the chicken soaks up the flavours of the other ingredients.

## Ingredients

- 4 British chicken thighs
- 30g black olives
- 125g fresh mozzarella 
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 100g British mini cooking chorizo
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 75g bulgur wheat
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425F/ Gas 7


Lightly season the chicken with salt


Place a dry, wide-base pan (with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the chicken (skin-side down) and cook for 5 min or until golden and crispy, without turning


### Step 2

Once golden, transfer the chicken, skin-side up, into an ovenproof dish


Discard the oil from the chicken pan but leave behind any bits at the bottom for step 7 (to lend extra flavour to the bulgur)


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice the garlic


Toss the whole cherry tomatoes, olives, garlic and oregano in a bowl


Trickle over about 20ml/2.5 tbsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">(40ml/5 tbsp)</span>&nbsp;olive oil (preferably extra virgin) and toss the tomatoes again to coat


### Step 4

Tip the dressed tomatoes over the chicken, pushing them down well with a spoon so that everything is well mixed together


### Step 5

De-link the chorizo and slice each one in half lengthways


Peel and cut the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into 8 wedges through the root


Tip: This ensures that the onion layers stay together whilst cooking


Lay the salami and onion wedges over the chicken


### Step 6

Tear the mozzarella over the top


Bake for 30-35min, or until the chicken is cooked through, the onions are charred around the edges and the cheese is bubbling and melted


Once the chicken has been cooking for 15 min, boil a kettle


### Step 7

Add the bulgur wheat to the reserved chicken pan with 180ml <span class="text-danger">(360ml)</span>&nbsp;boiled water, cover with a lid and place on a medium-low heat


Simmer for 5 min or until almost all the water is absorbed


Remove from the heat and leave covered for 10 min or until all water has absorbed &nbsp; &nbsp;

### Step 8

Remove the dish from the oven


Serve the chicken over the bulgur with a couple of spoonfuls of the sauce over the top


Season to your taste with salt and plenty of pepper and enjoy!
