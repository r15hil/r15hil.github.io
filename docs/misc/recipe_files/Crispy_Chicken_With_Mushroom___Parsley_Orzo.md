### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chicken thighs to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, cut your leek[s] in half lengthways and wash carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 7

Once the orzo is cooked, stir half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and all the grated cheese through the orzo

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mushroom & parsley orzo

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom & parsley orzo topped with the crispy chicken

Season with a generous grind of black pepper, garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle with some olive oil

Enjoy!
