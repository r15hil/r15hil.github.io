## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then transfer the cooked rice to a plate, reserving the pot


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s] and cut the remaining brown onion into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 3

While the chicken is browning, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine 2/3 of your soy sauce and your rice vinegar in a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar<span class="text-danger"> </span>and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water – this is your Filipino-style tocino sauce


### Step 4

Once the chicken has browned, add the onion wedges and cornflour to the pan with half the chopped garlic and give everything a good mix up until the cornflour has been absorbed by any juices

Add the Filipino-style tocino sauce and bring to the boil

Once boiling, cook, covered, for 10 min or until the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Filipino-style sticky chicken


### Step 5

Heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 6

Once starting to soften, add the remaining chopped garlic and remaining soy sauce to the pan with the cooked rice and blanched peas

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once warmed through, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>onto the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your garlic & egg fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the Filipino-style sticky chicken over the garlic & egg fried rice

Spoon any remaining Filipino-style tocino sauce from the pan over the top of the chicken

Garnish with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
