## Description

Halloumi cheese has a salty, almost meaty character that lends itself perfectly to sweet caramelised vegetables such as this slow cooked pepper & onion mixture; which become sweet & sour & almost chutney-like. Our couscous and lambs lettuce salad is dressed in a tangy spicy dressing made from harissa paste (an earthy chilli paste from Morocco).
