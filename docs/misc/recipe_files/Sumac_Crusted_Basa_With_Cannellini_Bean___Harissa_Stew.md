## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely, then peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your tomatoes finely

Peel and chop your potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 min or until beginning to break down


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and 3/4 of your harissa paste (you'll use the rest later!) in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Grate your Italian hard cheese finely

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes have completely softened, add the harissa stock to the pot with the chopped potato, drained cannellini beans and a pinch of sugar

Bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender – this is your cannellini bean & harissa stew


### Step 6

Whilst the stew is cooking, combine your panko breadcrumbs and grated Italian hard cheese in a bowl with your ground sumac and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your sumac crumb


### Step 7

Spread the remaining harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over each basa fillet, then top with the sumac crumb

Add the basa fillet[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your sumac-crusted basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the cannellini bean & harissa stew topped with the sumac-crusted basa

Enjoy!
