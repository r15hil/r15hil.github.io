## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Cut your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g] </span>butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, combine your tomato paste, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) ground smoked paprika, chopped garlic, red wine vinegar and dried oregano with a pinch of salt – this is your peri-peri paste


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the peri peri paste to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour, mix everything together and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> [340ml]</span> boiled water, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> milk and your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly thickened


### Step 5

While the sauce is thickening, chop your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your peri-peri basa pie filling


### Step 6

Transfer the peri-peri basa pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the potato discs – this is your potato-topped peri-peri basa pie

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the fish is cooked through and the pie is bubbling and golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Wash your spring greens then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens with a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

### Step 8

Serve the potato-topped peri-peri basa pie with the spring greens to the side

Enjoy!
