### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop them both finely, keeping the stalks and leaves separate

Wash, then slice your pak choi in half lengthways and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 4

Add 2/3 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a pestle & mortar with the chopped shallot, chopped coriander stalks and cracked black pepper

Grind to a paste, then add your fish sauce with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and stir it all together – this is your garlic pepper marinade

Drain, then add your jumbo king prawns to a bowl with the garlic pepper marinade, give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1692890527952-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add the halved pak choi and mangetout to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Scrunch the foil around the veg to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!) and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the greens are tender

### Step 6

Whilst the veg is cooking, chop your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Combine your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in a bowl with the juice of your lime[s], the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining chopped garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your chilli dipping sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1692890536046-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Sprinkle your cornflour evenly over the marinated prawns

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated prawns and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your Thai-style garlic pepper jumbo prawns

### Step 8

Serve the sticky rice with the Thai-style garlic pepper jumbo prawns and steamed greens to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Serve the chilli dipping sauce to the side and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
