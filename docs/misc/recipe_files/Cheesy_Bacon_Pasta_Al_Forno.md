## Description

This easy, creamy bake is a real crowd-pleaser: bacon, cheese and pasta… what’s not to love? Mac 'n' cheese gets a bit of a twist, with a simple crème fraîche-based sauce and smoky, satisfying bacon. You'll top it all off with a garlic and herb cheesy crumb, adding extra crunch. Oh, and did we mention bacon?
