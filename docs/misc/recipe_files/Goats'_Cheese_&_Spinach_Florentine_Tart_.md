### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the potatoes are starting to brown

### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the oven, wash the spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop roughly

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chopped wilted spinach and chopped garlic with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has softened

Stir through half the goats' cheese (you'll use the rest later!) with a splash of water and cook for 1 min further – this is your creamy spinach

### Step 4

Meanwhile, line a separate baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

Add the pastry to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

### Step 5

Top the pastry with the creamy spinach (keep it within the borders!)

Break up the remaining goats’ cheese and sprinkle it over the top equally (leave the centre empty as this is where your egg will go!)

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 9 min or until the pastry edges have begun to puff up

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1615909501839-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the green tomato chutney, white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a small bowl – this is your chutney dressing

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-copy-1615909519520-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the tarts have had an initial 9 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and crack the eggs into the centre of each tart

Return the tarts to the oven for a final 6 min or until the eggs are cooked (the yolk should still be a little runny) and the pastry is golden and cooked through – these are your goats' cheese & spinach florentine tarts

Wash the rocket, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the goats' cheese & spinach florentine tarts with the roast potatoes and rocket mixed together to the side

Drizzle over the chutney dressing and finish with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
