## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal, then slice each individual carrot disc into matchsticks

Wash then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop the into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the carrot matchsticks and chopped pak choi white bases with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 6-8 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the vegetables are cooking, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min or until softened

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water


### Step 4

Combine your sambal with your ketjap manis, soy sauce, tomato ketchup and toasted sesame oil in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water – this is your mie goreng sauce


### Step 5

Once the veg has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the chopped pak choi green tops, drained noodles and mie goreng sauce to the pan with the vegetables and mix it all together until everything coated in the sauce – this is your vegetable mie goreng

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the vegetable mie goreng and top with a fried egg

Drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
