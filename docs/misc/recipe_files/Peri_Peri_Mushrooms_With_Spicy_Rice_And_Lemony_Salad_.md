### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, ground turmeric and half the tomato paste (you'll use the rest later!) in 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until they've softened slightly

### Step 4

Add the white long grain rice, tomato stock and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your spicy rice

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the white wine vinegar, chipotle paste, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining tomato paste with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon in a large mixing bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your peri peri sauce

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1617029469842-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the flat white mushrooms to the peri peri sauce and give it a good mix up until they are fully coated

Transfer the coated mushrooms<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a baking tray, stems facing up (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and drizzle over any remaining peri peri sauce

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until cooked through and tender – these are your peri peri mushrooms

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1617029492461-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash, then shred the lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the mayo with the juice of 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>lemon wedges and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your lemon mayo

Add the shredded lettuce to the bowl with the lemon mayo, then give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony salad

### Step 8

Once the mushrooms are cooked, slice them finely

Serve the sliced peri peri mushrooms with the spicy rice and lemony salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!
