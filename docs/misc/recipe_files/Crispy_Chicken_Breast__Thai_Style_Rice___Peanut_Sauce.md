## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is almost cooked with a slight bite

Once done, transfer the basmati rice to a plate (reserve the pot) and spread it out flat to help it cool down


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Finely slice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>red chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Add the diced chicken breast to a bowl with your ground coriander, half the grated ginger (you'll use the rest later!), half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Add your cornflour to the bowl and give everything a good stir until the chicken is fully coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your green beans in half

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!), golden and crispy – this is your crispy chicken breast


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion and halved green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until they're starting to soften

While everything is cooking, thoroughly mix your peanut butter with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 1/2 tbsp]</span> water until loosened, then stir through your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your spicy peanut sauce

### Step 7

Once softened, add the grated ginger, chopped garlic and remaining chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the green beans and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Add your sesame oil, fish sauce and cooled basmati rice with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min further, stirring frequently, or until everything is warmed through

Stir through the chopped coriander – this is your Thai-style rice

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chicken breast with the Thai-style rice and the spicy peanut sauce to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, serve the peanut sauce in a little bowl for dipping!

Garnish with the remaining chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy
