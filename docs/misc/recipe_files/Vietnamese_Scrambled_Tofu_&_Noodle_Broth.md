Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

### Step 5

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain the tofu

Once very hot, crumble the tofu into the pan and add the cornflour with a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Tip: Different shapes and sizes are good for texture!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash then cut the pak choi in half, separating the white bases and green tops

Cut the white bases into bite-sized pieces

Bash the roasted peanuts roughly with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

### Step 7

Add all of the pak choi to the spicy broth, roughly tear in the coriander, basil and mint leaves (discard the mint stems)

Increase the heat to medium and cook, covered for 1-2 min further

Meanwhile, add half the crushed peanuts (you'll use the rest for garnish!) to the tofu and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Drain the turmeric rice noodles, then serve in bowls and pour over the spicy broth & pak choi

Top with the scrambled tofu

Garnish with the remaining crushed peanuts

Enjoy!
