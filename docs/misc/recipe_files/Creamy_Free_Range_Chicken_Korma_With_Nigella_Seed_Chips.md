### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your nigella seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden – these are your nigella seed chips

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add 2/3 of the chopped onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, increase the heat to high, then add the chopped chicken and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium high, then add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and your curry powder to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Add the coconut stock, ground almonds and a pinch of sugar to the pan and cook for 5-6 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, dice your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the diced tomato, chopped coriander and remaining chopped onion to a bowl and mix to combine – this is your tomato & onion salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1709039925747-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, stir in your natural yoghurt and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your creamy free range chicken korma

### Step 8

Serve your creamy free range chicken korma with the nigella seed chips and the tomato & onion salad to the side

Enjoy!
