## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 390g black beans
- 80g soured cream
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 0 black beans
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 6 plain tortillas
- 20g chipotle paste
- 2 garlic cloves 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pot (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, add the diced onion, ground smoked paprika, cumin seeds, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 6-7 min further or until the onion has started to soften


### Step 4

Whilst the onion is softening, dissolve your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of sugar in 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [500ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[650ml] </span>boiled water – this is your spicy stock


### Step 5

Brush your tortillas lightly with olive oil

Chop the oiled tortillas into triangles (layer them up to speed up the process!)

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until golden and crisp – these are your tortilla chips


### Step 6

Drain and rinse your butter beans

Add the drained butter beans, chopped tomatoes and spicy stock to the pot and cook for 6-8 min or until the soup has thickened slightly and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your warming Mexican-style chicken soup


### Step 7

While the soup is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 8

Serve the warming Mexican-style chicken soup in bowls and dollop over your soured cream

Garnish with the grated cheese

Serve the tortilla chips to the side, ready for dipping

Enjoy!
