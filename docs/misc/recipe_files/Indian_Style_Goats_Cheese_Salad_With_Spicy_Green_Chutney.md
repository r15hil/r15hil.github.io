### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into quarters, leaving the skins and roots on (this stops them drying out and falling apart when roasting)

### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato and red onion quarters to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the onion is tender and the sweet potato is cooked and starting to crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, pick a few coriander leaves from the stalks and set them aside for garnish, then chop your remaining coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 4

Add the chopped coriander, garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a pestle & mortar and grind to a paste

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything very finely!

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and juice of half your lime[s] and mix to combine

Season with a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar – this is your spicy green chutney

### Step 5

Combine the juice of the remaining lime with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Spread your nigella seeds over a chopping board

Roll your goats' cheese into the nigella seeds until evenly coated – this is your nigella goats' cheese

### Step 7

Once the vegetables are done, carefully cut off the roots of the roasted red onions, peel off their skins, discard the roots and skins and separate them into petals

Add the red onion petals, roasted sweet potato and salad to a bowl and toss everything together with the dressing – this is your salad

Crumble the nigella goats' cheese into rough pieces

### Step 8

Serve the salad topped with the crumbled nigella goats' cheese and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves – this is your Indian-style goats' cheese salad

Dollop over the spicy green chutney

Enjoy!
