### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned aubergine and cook for 1 min on each side or until browned

Transfer the browned aubergine to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through (reserve the pan for later!) – this is your spiced aubergine

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and dice your red onion[s]

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold water

### Step 7

Once the lentils are cooked, remove them from the heat and stir in 2/3 of your cultured coconut, 2/3 of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and a grind of pepper – this is your two-lentil dal

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the two-lentil dal in a bowl topped with the spiced aubergine

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a dollop of the remaining cultured coconut

Enjoy!
