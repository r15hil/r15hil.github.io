## Ingredients

- Fine green beans (160g)
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- White potato x4
- Rosemary (5g)
- Spring onion
- Garlic clove x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Crush your garlic cloves by pressing them down with the side of a knife (skins on!)


### Step 3

Add the free range chicken breasts portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped potatoes, crushed garlic and rosemary leaves

Season everything with a pinch of salt and pepper, drizzle with vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up


### Step 4

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 5

Once the chicken has been cooking for 20 min, trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water ( just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot and cover until serving


### Step 6

While the beans are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1 min


### Step 7

Stir in your soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your sun-dried tomato sauce

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced free range chicken over the sun-dried tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes, roasted garlic and green beans to the side

Enjoy!
