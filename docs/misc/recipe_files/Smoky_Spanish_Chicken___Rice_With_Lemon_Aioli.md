Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Chop the green beans in half (cut them in one bunch for speed!)

### Step 4

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!

### Step 6

Add the smoked paprika, heated basmati rice and chicken stock to the pan and cook for a further 3 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky Spanish chicken & rice

### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, combine the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon with the mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon aioli

Squeeze the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon into the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the smoky Spanish chicken & rice and drizzle the lemon aioli all over

Garnish with the lemon wedges and a grind of black pepper

Tear the parsley leaves all over and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
