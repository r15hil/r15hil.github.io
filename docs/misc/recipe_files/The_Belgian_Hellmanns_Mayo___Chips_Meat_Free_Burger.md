### Step 2

Add the chips to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-8 min or until part-cooked

Meanwhile, add the shredded red cabbage to a large bowl with half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up

Set aside until serving – this is your pickled red cabbage

### Step 3

Once done, drain and lay the chips flat on a baking tray to steam dry

Tip: For extra crispy chips, carefully shake them around in the colander to fluff up the edges a little before baking

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy, turning once halfway through

### Step 7

After 8 min, add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return the tray to the oven for 2-4 min or until the bread is lightly toasted and the burgers are cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 8

Build your burger by topping the base with some pickled red cabbage, a vegan patty, some chunky chips, a drizzle of the Belgian Hellmann's mayo and the lid

Serve with the remaining chunky chips, pickled cabbage and Belgian Hellmann's mayo to the side

Enjoy!
