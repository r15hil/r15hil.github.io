## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 200g raclette cheese
- 40g Napoli & peppered salami mix
- 24g Serrano ham
- 50g cornichons
- 140g pickled red cabbage
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cut the waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until fork tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onions finely


### Step 3

Add the sliced spring onions to a large bowl with the pickled cabbage, mayo and a pinch of salt and give everything a really good mix up – this is your creamy winter slaw


### Step 4

For fancy presentation, cut the peppered salami in half and roll each half into cone-shapes

Roll the Napoli salami into tubes and cut in half

Tip: Too fiddly? Just break both up into smaller pieces!

Tear the Serrano ham into smaller pieces and add to a serving board with the Napoli salami and salami cones – this is your charcuterie


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are fork tender, add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Bash the potatoes with a rolling pin, or crush them with a fork


### Step 6

Season with a generous pinch of salt and top with the raclette cheese slices

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until the raclette is melted and starting to bubble around the edges


### Step 7

Slice the cornichons in half lengthways

### Step 8

Serve the raclette-topped potatoes with dollops of the creamy winter slaw, the charcuterie pieces and sliced cornichons

Season with a grind of black pepper

Let everyone dig in!
