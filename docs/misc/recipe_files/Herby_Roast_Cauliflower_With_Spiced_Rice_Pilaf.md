## Ingredients

- 1 coconut yoghurt pot (80g)
- 1 cauliflower
- 130g basmati rice
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes 
- 1 bag of ground almonds (25g)
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 20g coriander
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 brown onion
- 1 bag of sultanas (30g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the cauliflower into florets and add them to a baking tray

Drizzle the florets with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 35-40 min or until the cauliflower is starting to turn brown and crisp


### Step 2

While the cauliflower is cooking, peel and dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 3

Heat a pot with a lid with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sultanas and a pinch of salt

Cook for 3 min or until the onion has softened slightly


### Step 4

Add the basmati rice to the pot and stir to coat the grains in oil

Add 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving - this is your spiced rice pilaf


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish)


### Step 6

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and most of the chopped coriander to a food processor with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> of both salt and pepper with a pinch of sugar and blitz until blended and smooth


### Step 7

Add the ground almonds and coconut yoghurt with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the food processor and blitz again into a thick paste – this is your fresh chutney

Fluff the spiced rice pilaf with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the roast cauliflower over the spiced rice pilaf with the fresh chutney dotted around

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!
