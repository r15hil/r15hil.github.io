### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your walnuts and toast for 3-4 min, or until they've darkened in colour slightly

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 3

While the walnuts are toasting, chop your basil coarsely (including the stalks)

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Crumble your cheddar cheese into small pieces

Transfer the toasted walnuts to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop the walnuts with a knife, then add to a pestle & mortar!

### Step 4

Add the chopped basil, chopped garlic and crumbled cheddar to the food processor (or a pestle & mortar), along with your red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper, and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz together to form a coarse purée – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min on each side until golden

Tip: Grind a generous amount of pepper onto the chicken for an extra kick of spice

### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Once the chicken has browned, add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for a further 2-4 min, or until the tomatoes have softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork

Stir the fluffed bulgur and half of the walnut & cheddar pesto (reserve the rest for garnish!) through the chicken and tomatoes, until everything is lightly coated in the pan juices and pesto – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto chicken with bulgur

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the walnut & cheddar pesto chicken with bulgur over the salad

Dot the remaining walnut & cheddar pesto all over

Enjoy!
