## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice your red onion[s] finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add most of the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, rinse your brown rice and add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot with a knob of butter and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 5

Combine your chopped dates, tamarind paste, chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your date & tamarind stock

Chop your coriander finely (including the stalks), then dice your tomato[es] and cucumber and set everything aside for later


### Step 6

Add the chopped ginger, ground turmeric, curry powder and a generous grind of black pepper to the softened onion and cook for 30 secs

Add the date & tamarind stock and give everything a good mix up

Add your chicken breast strips and increase the heat to high

Cook, covered, for 13-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency


### Step 7

Combine the diced tomato, diced cucumber and remaining onion with a pinch of salt and drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl, then add the chopped coriander just before serving – this is your Indian-style salad

Remove the pan from the heat and shred the cooked chicken apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken, date & tamarind curry

### Step 8

Serve the chicken, date & tamarind curry over the brown rice with the Indian-style salad to the side

Enjoy!
