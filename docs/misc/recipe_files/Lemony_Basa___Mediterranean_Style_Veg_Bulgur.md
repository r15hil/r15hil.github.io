## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Parsley (5g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Bulgur wheat (130g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Add the chopped tomatoes and onion to a baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until the onion is cooked and starting to crisp


### Step 3

While the tomatoes and onions are cooking, add your bulgur wheat and your vegetable stock mix to a pot with a lid with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water over a medium heat

Cook, covered for 5-7 min or until almost all the water has absorbed

Once done, remove the pot from the heat, fluff with a fork and set aside until later


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your basa fillet[s] in half width ways


### Step 5

Combine the juice of your lemon[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, your dried oregano, half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herb marinade

Dip the chopped basa in the herb marinade (reserve the remaining marinade)


### Step 6

Roughly chop your cucumber and add to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and remaining chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Just add half!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tzatziki

Once the tomatoes and onions are crisp, add them to the cooked bulgur with the chopped parsley and give it a good mix up – this is your Mediterranean-style veg bulgur


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa pieces to the pan and cook for an initial 3-4 min

After 3-4 min, turn the basa, add the remaining herb marinade to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the basa is cooked through - this is your lemony basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the lemony basa over the Mediterranean-style veg bulgur with the tzatziki on the side

Enjoy!
