## Ingredients

- 1 mild curry paste sachet (30g)
- 160g fine green beans
- 280g cooked brown long grain rice
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 vegetable stock mix sachet (5.5g)
- 50g solid coconut cream
- 200g haddock bites
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop the green beans in half

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 3

Add the halved green beans to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5 min or until fork-tender

Drain and return the cooked green beans to the pot


### Step 4

While the green beans are cooking, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and the chopped coconut cream in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir through the mild curry paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of sugar – this is your korma sauce


### Step 5

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed brown basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

Once done, add the heated brown basmati rice to the cooked beans with a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the korma sauce and cook for 2 min


### Step 7

Add the haddock bites and cook for 4-5 min until the fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your fish korma

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the fish korma over the cooked brown rice and green beans

Garnish with the chopped spring onion and nigella seeds

Enjoy!
