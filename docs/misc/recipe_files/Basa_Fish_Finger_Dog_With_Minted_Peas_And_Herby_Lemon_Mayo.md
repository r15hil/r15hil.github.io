### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Slice your basa fillet[s] in half lengthways

### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a small bowl

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and mix together (this will make your breadcrumbs golden!)

Season the basa strips with salt, then coat them in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

### Step 4

Add the coated basa to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 14-15 min or until cooked through and golden – these are your basa fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped dill and mayo in a small bowl with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby lemon mayo

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 6

Boil a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with the mint sauce, a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your minted peas

### Step 7

Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s]

Once the fish fingers are nearly done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the cut hot dog bun[s] to the baking tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build, spread a spoonful of the minted peas in the warmed hot dog bun and top with the basa fish fingers and a drizzle of the herby lemon mayo – these are your basa fish finger dogs

Serve the basa fish finger dogs with the chips, remaining minted peas, and tomato ketchup to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
