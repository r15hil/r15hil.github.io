## Ingredients

- Conchiglie (100g) x0
- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Conchiglie (200g)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the conchiglie, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

Reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, drained sweetcorn, ground smoked paprika and dried oregano and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and your soft cheese to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the cooked conchiglie and half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy corn conchiglie

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy corn conchiglie topped with the remaining grated cheese

Enjoy!
