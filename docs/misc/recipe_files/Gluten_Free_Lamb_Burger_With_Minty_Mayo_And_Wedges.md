## Ingredients

- British lamb mince (250g)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Mint (5g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- Gluten free brioche buns (2pcs)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Tomato
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your lamb mince in a bowl with the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper

Massage the lamb mince mixture with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patty[ies] hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the lamb mince mix into 1 per person, shape into a thin patty[ies] and refrigerate


### Step 3

Peel your cucumber, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Squeeze out the excess liquid from the cucumber ribbons (over the sink is the easiest place)

Tip: You want to get rid of the excess liquid so that the cucumber absorbs the pickling vinegar


### Step 4

Add your white wine vinegar to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and the cucumber ribbons

Mix to combine and set aside to pickle until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 5

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Combine your mayo and chopped mint in a bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil – this is your minty mayo

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the lamb patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Whilst the lamb is cooking, slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To assemble, layer your warmed brioche base with a pile of quick-pickled cucumber, a lamb patty, sliced tomato and a generous dollop of minty mayo, then top with the brioche lid – this is your lamb burger

Serve the lamb burger with the wedges and any remaining minty mayo to the side

Enjoy!
