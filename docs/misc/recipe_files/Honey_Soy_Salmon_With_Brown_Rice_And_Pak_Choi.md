## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it’s opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

While the salmon is cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the base off the pak choi and discard, then chop the rest roughly


### Step 4

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 5

Once the pan is hot, add the chopped pak choi and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your lime[s] in half

Combine your ginger paste, soy sauce, honey and the juice of half your lime[s] in a bowl – this is your honey soy sauce

Once the salmon is cooked, add the honey soy sauce to the pan with the salmon and cook for 2 min or until slightly thickened – this is your honey soy salmon


### Step 7

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the honey soy salmon with the brown rice and pak choi to the side

Drizzle with any remaining honey soy sauce

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds, chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
