## Ingredients

- Shredded spring greens (120g)
- Creamy single soy (200ml)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Butternut squash cubes (160g)
- Dried sage (1tsp)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- White potato x2
- Carrot
- Spinach (80g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your potatoes into small bite-sized cubes

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes, carrot batons and butternut squash cubes to the pan with your dried sage and cook for 3-4 min, or until the veg begins to lightly colour

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Add your creamy single soy and vegetable stock mix with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Add the spinach to the pan and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 20-25 min or until the potatoes and squash have softened and the sauce has reduced – this is your winter squash & sage pie filling


### Step 6

Meanwhile, line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 per person

Add the pastry to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your pie lids


### Step 7

Wash your shredded spring greens, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to a large piece of tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around the greens to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until the greens are tender

### Step 8

Serve the pie lids over the winter squash & sage filling with the spring greens to the side

Enjoy!
