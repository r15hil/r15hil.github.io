## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your dried ancho chilli[es] roughly and discard the stem[s]

Add your chopped ancho chilli to a bowl, cover with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and set aside to soak


### Step 2

Cut half of your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Chop the remaining potato[es] (skins on) into small cubes

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the potato cubes and diced chorizo to the pan with a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for an initial 6-7 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and slice half your red onion[s] as finely as you can

Dice the remaining onion

Combine your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a bowl with a small pinch of salt and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and mix it all together

Add the sliced onion to the bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled onion


### Step 5

Add the soaked ancho chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and all of the soaking liquid to a food processor with your tomato paste and blitz until smooth – this is your pambazo sauce

Once the potato has had an initial 6-7 min, add the diced onion and dried oregano with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 7-8 min or until the potato is cooked through

Once cooked through, add 2/3 of the pambazo sauce (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant – this is your pambazo filling


### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Brush the brioche lid[s] with the remaining pambazo sauce

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!), then put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Crumble your feta into a bowl

Add your mayo to the bowl with a splash of cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your feta mayo

Drain the quick-pickled onion (save the pickling liquid!)

### Step 8

To assemble, fill each warmed brioche bun with a little shredded lettuce, the pambazo filling, quick-pickled onion and a dollop of feta mayo – this is your Mexican-style pambazo

Serve the chips and remaining shredded lettuce to the side with the reserved pickling liquid drizzled over the top

Enjoy!
