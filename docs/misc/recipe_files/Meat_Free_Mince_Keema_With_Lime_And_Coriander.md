## Ingredients

- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 0 tomato paste
- 0 white basmati rice
- 32g tomato paste 
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 0 curry powder
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 130g basmati rice
- 2 carrots
- 10g coriander
- 0 coriander
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lime
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s], then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3 min, or until starting to soften, then add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for a further 3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrots into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Tip: Take the meat-free mince off the heat if you need longer to chop to avoid burning!


### Step 3

Add the chopped carrot, grated ginger and grated garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min


### Step 4

Add your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and curry powder into the pan and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Stir your basmati rice into the pan


### Step 6

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the rice is cooked and the water has been absorbed

Check and stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice looks a little dry!


### Step 7

While the rice is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Stir the chopped coriander and juice of half your lime[s] through the cooked rice – this is your meat-free mince keema

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Chop the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free mince keema in bowls

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!
