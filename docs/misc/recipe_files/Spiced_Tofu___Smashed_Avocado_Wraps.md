## Ingredients

- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Black beans (185g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Plain tortillas (4pcs)
- Avocado
- Plain tofu (280g)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Shallot
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 2

Heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add half of the diced shallot with half your smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and your ground cumin

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your drained black beans to the pot with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [75ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the beans have softened

Once the beans have softened, gently crush them with a masher a few times and set aside – these are your refried beans


### Step 4

While the beans are cooking, cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways around the stone[s], remove the stone[s] using a spoon then scoop out the avocado flesh

Add the avocado flesh to a small bowl with half of your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and the remaining diced shallot

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash with a fork until smooth – this is your smashed avocado


### Step 5

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut it into strips

Add the tofu strips to a bowl with your soy sauce

Add the remaining smoked paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Coat the tofu strips in the flour mix – this is your coated tofu


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 6 min, turning often or until crispy all over, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper – this is your crispy smoky tofu

Meanwhile, combine the remaining white wine vinegar with your mayo – this is your tangy mayo


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Top half of each warmed tortilla with some of the refried beans, smashed avocado, crispy tofu, shredded lettuce and a drizzle of tangy mayo

Fold the sides of each tortilla in and roll until you have a tight wrap

Slice them in half – these are your spiced tofu & smashed avocado wraps

Enjoy!
