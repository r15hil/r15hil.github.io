## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and cut into rounds, approx. 1cm thick

Add the aubergine rounds to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Combine half your white miso paste (save the rest for later!) with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar in a bowl, then divide it equally between the aubergine rounds and put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until golden and caramelised


### Step 4

While the aubergine is in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince to the pan and roughly break it up with a wooden spoon so you're left with bite-sized pieces

Cook for 6-7 min turning once halfway until browned all over


### Step 5

While the pork mince is browning, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the remaining white miso paste with 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water, your tamari soy sauce, rice vinegar, chicken stock mix and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your miso stock


### Step 6

Once the pork has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the chopped ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated


### Step 7

Once the pork is coated, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for for 30 secs or until evaporated, then add the miso stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add it to the pan with half your toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted – this is your fragrant lean pork broth

Meanwhile, finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

Serve the sushi rice in a bowl to the side and spoon in the fragrant lean pork broth

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top the broth with the miso aubergine, the remaining toasted sesame oil and the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
