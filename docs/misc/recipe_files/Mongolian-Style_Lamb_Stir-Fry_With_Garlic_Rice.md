### Step 1

Peel and finely chop (or grate) half your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Heat a pot with a matching lid over a low heat and add a knob of butter

Once melted, add the chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 2

Once fragrant, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your garlic rice

### Step 3

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Slice each individual carrot disc into matchsticks

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until nicely browned all over, breaking it up into large chunks with a wooden spoon as you go

Boil half a kettle

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1685605009725-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, keeping the whites and greens separate

Peel and finely slice (don’t chop!) the remaining garlic

Once the mince is browned, add the onion petals and carrot matchsticks to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min, stirring frequently until starting to soften and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1685605013273-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve your hoisin sauce and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, five-spice mix and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar – this is your hoisin stock

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1685605017758-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the onion petals are starting to soften, add the spring onion whites (save the spring onion greens for garnish!), sliced garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the hoisin stock to the pan and reduce the heat to medium

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your Mongolian-style lamb stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the Mongolian-style lamb stir-fry over the garlic rice

Garnish with the reserved spring onion greens, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and plenty of black pepper

Enjoy!
