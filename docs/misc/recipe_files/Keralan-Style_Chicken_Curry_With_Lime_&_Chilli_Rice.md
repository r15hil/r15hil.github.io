### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, then once hot, add your coriander seeds and fennel seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and toasted, then transfer to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 2

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 3-4 min or until browned

Once browned, add your ground turmeric and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the browned chicken to a plate, reserve the pan and juices

### Step 3

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughy chop your garlic

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

### Step 4

Add the chopped shallot, tomato, ginger and garlic to the food processor with the toasted spices

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your spice paste

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the reserved pan and juices to a medium-high heat

Add the spice paste and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the browned chicken, halved green beans and coconut stock and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Keralan-style chicken curry

### Step 7

Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s]

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Add the lime zest and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the cooked rice and give it a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli rice

Squeeze the juice of half the lime[s] over the Keralan-style chicken curry, then cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Keralan-style chicken curry over the lime & chilli rice

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
