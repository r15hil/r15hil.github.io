### Step 2

Add a pinch of sugar and salt to a bowl with a splash of boiled water and give everything a good mix up until dissolved

Add the red wine vinegar and sliced red onion and set aside to pickle – these are your pickled onions


### Step 3

Add the basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, combine the achiote paste, smoked paprika, ground cumin, soy sauce, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your achiote marinade

Add the basa fillets to the achiote marinade and give everything a good mix up until the fish is completely covered


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated fish and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through and slightly charred


### Step 6

Whilst the fish is cooking, dice the remaining red onion

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>using a spoon and roughly chop

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your avocado salsa

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the achiote fish over the rice with the avocado salsa to the side

Top with the pickled onions and garnish with a wedge of lime

Enjoy!
