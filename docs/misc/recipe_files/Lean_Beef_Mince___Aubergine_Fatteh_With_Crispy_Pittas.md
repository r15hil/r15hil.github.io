## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion with a small pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened (you'll use the rest later!)

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your lean beef mince to the pan and cook for a further 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add your ground cumin, ras el hanout and the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add the tomato stock and cook for 7-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Whilst the sauce is thickening, cut your wholemeal pittas into triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a tray

Put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until crisp and starting to brown


### Step 6

Add the remaining sliced onion to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and your white wine vinegar and mix well

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Add the chopped tomato to the bowl with most of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato & mint salsa


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the roasted aubergine with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your lean beef mince & aubergine stew

### Step 8

Serve the lean beef mince & aubergine stew over the crispy pittas – this is your lean beef mince & aubergine fatteh

Scatter over the tomato & mint salsa and crumble your feta all over

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint

Enjoy!
