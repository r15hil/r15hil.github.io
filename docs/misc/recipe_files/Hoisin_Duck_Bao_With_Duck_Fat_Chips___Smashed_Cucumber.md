### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Separate your duck leg[s] from the white duck fat and duck jelly (you'll use these in different parts of the recipe!)

Add the duck leg[s] and half the duck jelly (you'll use the rest later!) to a baking paper-lined oven proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Add the duck fat to a baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 2-3 min or until melted and hot

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Once hot, carefully add the chips to the baking tray with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your duck fat chips

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your hoisin sauce to a pot with the remaining duck jelly, half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook over a low heat for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened, then set aside – this is your hoisin glaze

### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into thirds, then slice each third into thin strips

### Step 5

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin then chop it into large bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Add the smashed cucumber to a medium bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper – this is your smashed cucumber salad

### Step 6

Warm the hoisin glaze over a low heat

Once cooked, remove the duck legs from the oven and shred apart using two forks (watch out for any bones!) – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Discard all the bones and mix the duck with the juices – this is your shredded duck

### Step 7

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build, fill each warmed bao bun with the shredded duck

Drizzle with the hoisin glaze then top with the shredded spring onion – these are your hoisin duck bao buns

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin duck bao buns with the duck fat chips and smashed cucumber salad to the side

Enjoy!
