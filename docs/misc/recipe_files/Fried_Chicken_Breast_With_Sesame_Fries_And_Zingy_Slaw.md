### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into thin strips

### Step 2

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and soy sauce to a medium bowl – this is your marinade

Add the chicken strips and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until they're cooked through and crisp

### Step 4

While the fries are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways and slice finely

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

### Step 5

Add the sliced spring onion, grated carrot and sliced cucumber to a small bowl

Add your rice vinegar and mix to combine – this is your zingy slaw

Combine your mayo with your hoisin sauce in a separate bowl – this is your hoisin mayo

### Step 6

Add your cornflour to a large bowl

Add the marinated chicken strips, leaving most of the marinade behind, discard the leftover chicken marinade

Stir it all together so the chicken strips are fully coated in cornflour – this is your coated chicken

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken breast

Sprinkle the fries with your toasted sesame seeds – these are your sesame fries

### Step 8

Serve the fried chicken breast with the sesame fries, zingy slaw and hoisin mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
