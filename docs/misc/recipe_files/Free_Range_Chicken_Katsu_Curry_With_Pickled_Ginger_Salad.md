### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs, then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

Remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

### Step 2

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and peel half your ginger into lengths

Finely chop (or grate) your remaining ginger

Add the peeled ginger to a small bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside for later – this is your soaked ginger

### Step 3

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a separate pot with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger, onion, garlic and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, ground turmeric and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water, chopped creamed coconut, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and soy sauce to the pot

Cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency, then blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your curry sauce

### Step 5

Cover your free range chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness then season with salt

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat lightly, add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour to a plate, then add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate with a generous pinch of salt

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, then add to the beaten egg and firmly press into the seasoned breadcrumbs

### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan!) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded free range chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the outside is golden

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1687858776220-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Drain the soaked ginger, then add it to a large bowl with your red wine vinegar, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your quick-pickled ginger salad

On a clean board, slice the breaded chicken finely into strips – this is your free range chicken katsu

### Step 8

Return the curry sauce to a medium heat to reheat

Top the sushi rice with the free range chicken katsu, then spoon over the curry sauce

Serve the quick-pickled ginger salad to the side

Enjoy!
