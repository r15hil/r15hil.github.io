- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 30g 3 seed mix

- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 2 tbsp tomato paste

- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Top, tail and chop the&nbsp;courgette<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into bite-sized chunks


Deseed the yellow&nbsp;pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>


Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the&nbsp;garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the sliced red onion and yellow&nbsp;pepper with a pinch of salt&nbsp;and cook for 5-8 min or until softened


Once softened, add the courgette chunks and garlic slices and cook for a further 5 min until beginning to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Dissolve the vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>in 450ml <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water


Once the vegetables&nbsp;have softened, add the dried&nbsp;oregano and tomato paste&nbsp;and cook for 1 min


### Step 4

Add the&nbsp;vegetable stock and&nbsp;balsamic vinegar&nbsp;to the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low


Cook for 10-15 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the liquid has reduced by half&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the&nbsp;basil&nbsp;finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Add the&nbsp;chopped&nbsp;basil to a&nbsp;pestle &amp; mortar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;warm water&nbsp;and a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt


Grind to a paste, then add 1 tbsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]&nbsp;</span>olive oil&nbsp;and mix to combine &ndash; this is your&nbsp;basil oil


### Step 6

Once the stock has reduced, pat the&nbsp;basa fillets&nbsp;dry with&nbsp;kitchen paper


Add the basa fillets to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min, or until cooked through &ndash; this is your ratatouille fish stew


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily!

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the 3 seed mix and mini baguette rolls to a baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until the seeds&nbsp;are toasted&nbsp;and the&nbsp;baguette rolls are warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the ratatouille&nbsp;fish stew in bowls


Drizzle over the&nbsp;basil oil and serve the&nbsp;warm baguette roll to the side


Garnish with the toasted seeds


Enjoy!
