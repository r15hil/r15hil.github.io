- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Chives (5g)
- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Spring onion x2
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 6-8 min or until starting to crisp

Whilst the chorizo is crisping, trim, then chop your spring onion[s]


### Step 3

Once the potatoes are done, drain them and return to the pot to steam dry

Mash the potatoes until smooth

Add half the cooked chorizo (reserve the pan, remaining chorizo and any oil for later), chopped spring onion and a pinch of<span class="text-danger"> </span>salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your chorizo & potato mixture


### Step 4

Shape the chorizo & potato mixture into 2 cakes per person

Add the chorizo potato cakes to a lightly oiled baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden

Tip: If the potato cake mix is a little wet and not sticking together nicely, add a spoonful or two of flour


### Step 5

While the potato cakes are cooking, add your white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your dressing

Wash your salad then add it to the dressing and give it a gentle mix up


### Step 6

Chop your chives finely


### Step 7

Return the pan with the remaining chorizo to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan on the opposite side to the chorizo

Cook, covered for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo potato cakes with your smashed avocado and salad to the side

Top with a fried egg and the crispy chorizo

Garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!
