### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Combine your cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with the sliced onion and set aside – this is your quick-pickled onion

### Step 3

Combine your natural yoghurt and mint sauce in a bowl – this is your mint yoghurt

### Step 4

Slice your paneer in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

### Step 5

Combine your cornflour and curry powder on a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your curried flour

Add the halved paneer to the curried flour and turn them several times until they're fully coated – this is your coated paneer

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1667909389857-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until lightly toasted

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove leaves from the lettuce for 1 per person and set aside

Chop the inner core[s] into quarters, lengthways – these are your lettuce wedges

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1667909393525-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated paneer and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy spiced paneer

Spread your mango chutney over the toasted brioche lid

### Step 8

To build, top the toasted brioche base with a reserved lettuce leaf, the crispy spiced paneer, a dollop of the mint yoghurt, some quick-pickled onion and a toasted brioche lid – this is your crispy spiced paneer burger

Serve the sweet potato fries and lettuce wedges to the side, then spoon the remaining quick-pickled onion and mint yoghurt over the lettuce wedges

Enjoy!
