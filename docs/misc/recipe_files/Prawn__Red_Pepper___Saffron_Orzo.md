### Step 1

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the red pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube in 500ml<span class="text-danger"> [900ml] </span>boiled water and add the saffron – this is your saffron stock

### Step 3

Once the pepper is beginning to soften, add the smoked paprika, sliced garlic and orzo pasta and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Add the saffron stock, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the orzo is cooked

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking!

### Step 5

Once the orzo is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

### Step 6

Season the orzo with a generous grind of pepper and squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed – this is your red pepper & saffron orzo

### Step 7

Add the chopped parsley to the pan with the cooked prawns and give everything a good mix up – these are your parsley prawns

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the red pepper & saffron orzo topped with a handful of rocket and the parsley prawns

Drizzle the rocket with some olive oil, garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
