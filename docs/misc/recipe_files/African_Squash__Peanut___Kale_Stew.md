## Description

This West African inspired stew is packed with butternut squash, shredded kale and two types of nuts – ground almonds thicken the stew, while peanut butter gives it a delicious sweet, rich & satisfying flavour. It's plant-based too, so you'd be nuts to miss out! (Gluten and dairy-free, suitable for coeliacs).
