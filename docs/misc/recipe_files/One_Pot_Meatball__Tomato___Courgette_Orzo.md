## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 1 courgette
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 150g orzo pasta
- 250g pork & beef ragù mince
- 1 can of tomato frito (200g)
- 1/2 Knorr beef stock cube
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add the pork & beef ragù mince to a bowl with the panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly to combine

Divide the mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> and shape them into meatballs


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, until browned all over

Once done, transfer the browned meatballs to a plate and set aside

Reserve the pan


### Step 3

Whilst the meatballs are browning, peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add the chopped onion with pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Whilst the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters, then into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 400ml<span class="text-danger"> [750ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped courgette and orzo and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat everything in the oil

Add the beef stock with the tomato frito, balsamic vinegar and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Top the orzo with the browned meatballs and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the orzo is tender and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your meatball, tomato & courgette orzo

Tip: Keep an eye on the orzo and stir it to stop it from sticking!


### Step 7

Whilst everything is cooking, chop the basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the meatball, tomato & courgette orzo in bowls topped with the grated Italian hard cheese, chopped basil and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
