### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside (reserve the pan!), these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Once the onion has started to soften, add your chopped tomatoes and beef stock mix to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

Return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork & beef meatballs with tomato sauce
