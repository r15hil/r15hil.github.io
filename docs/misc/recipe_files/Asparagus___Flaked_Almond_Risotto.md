## Ingredients

- 160g arborio rice
- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 15g flaked almonds
- 240g asparagus
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 2

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L] </span>boiled water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Slice the asparagus into rounds until you reach the tips, keeping the tips whole


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Add 1/3 of the vegetable stock and stir continuously until the stock has been absorbed into the rice

Add the asparagus rounds, then continue to add the remaining vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto


### Step 5

Meanwhile, roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges

Grate the Italian hard cheese


### Step 6

Add the reserved asparagus tips to one side of a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until the asparagus tips are nearly cooked and tender

After 5-6 min add the flaked almonds to the other side of the tray and cook for a further 2-3 min or until golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheese and a knob of butter

Add the juice of 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> lemon wedges

Season generously with salt and pepper

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the risotto in bowls topped with the toasted almonds and asparagus tips

Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
