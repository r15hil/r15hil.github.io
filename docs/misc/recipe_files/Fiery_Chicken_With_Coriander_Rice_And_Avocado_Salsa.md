### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water with your chicken stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] with cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground allspice to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and mix it all together

Add the flattened chicken to the plate and turn until well coated

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fiery chicken

Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and reserve the oil in the pan – this is your spicy oil

### Step 4

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and mash roughly

### Step 5

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the outer leaves and shred the inner core[s]

### Step 6

Add the mashed avocado and diced shallot to a bowl with half the coriander (you'll use the rest later!), your red wine vinegar, a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your avocado salsa

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the remaining chopped coriander and the shredded lettuce to the rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander rice

### Step 8

Slice the fiery chicken on a clean board and serve it over the coriander rice with the lettuce leaves to the side

Spoon over the avocado salsa and drizzle over the spicy oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
