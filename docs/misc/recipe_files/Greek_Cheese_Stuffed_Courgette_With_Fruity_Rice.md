## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 2 courgettes
- 100g greek salad cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 130g white long grain rice
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 25g honey
- 5g mint
- 25g pistachio nuts
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tsp coriander seeds
- 30g dried cranberries

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice the courgettes in half lengthways then scrape out the inner seeds using a teaspoon – these are your courgette boats

Chop the inner seeds roughly


### Step 2

Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

Crumble the Greek cheese into small pieces

Combine the chopped courgette and chopped garlic in a bowl with the crumbled Greek cheese, honey, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and panko breadcrumbs

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek cheese stuffing


### Step 3

Transfer the courgette boats to a baking tray and fill them with the Greek cheese stuffing

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until the courgette has softened and the Greek cheese stuffing is golden – this is your Greek cheese-stuffed courgette


### Step 4

While the courgette is cooking, add the basmati rice, the vegetable stock mix and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pistachio nuts and coriander seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer to a pestle & mortar


### Step 6

Add the ground turmeric and a pinch of salt to the pestle & mortar and grind to a fine crumble – this is your pistachio dukkah


### Step 7

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Combine the chopped mint and natural yoghurt in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your mint yoghurt

Once the rice is cooked, add the dried cranberries and a pinch of salt to the pan and stir it all together until fully combined – this is your fruity rice

### Step 8

Serve the fruity rice with the Greek cheese-stuffed courgette on top

Add a dollop of mint yoghurt to the side and sprinkle over the pistachio dukkah

Enjoy!
