## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain into a sieve and set aside (save the pot for later!)


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Dice your cucumber

Add the diced cucumber and sliced radishes to a bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled salad


### Step 3

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 4

Combine the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato ketchup, soy sauce and honey in a bowl – this is your soy and honey sauce


### Step 5

Drain your king prawns, then add them to a separate bowl with your five-spice and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Not a fan of five spice? Just add half!


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned prawns and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown slightly

Once browned add the soy and honey sauce to the pan and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the prawns are cooked through and a sticky sauce has formed, then remove from the heat


### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat

Wash your shredded kale

Add the drained rice with the shredded kale and cook for 2 min or until the kale is mixed through and beginning to wilt

Remove from the heat and season with a pinch of salt – this is your brown rice & kale

### Step 8

Serve the sticky king prawns over the brown rice & kale with the quick-pickled salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
