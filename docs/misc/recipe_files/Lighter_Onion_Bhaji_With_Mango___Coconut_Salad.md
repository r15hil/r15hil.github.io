## Ingredients

- 1 mango
- 2 tomatoes
- 80g cultured coconut
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 390g chickpeas
- 20g mint sauce
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 30g gram flour
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 10g coriander
- 1/2 cucumber
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(as finely as you can!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the coriander roughly (including the stalks)


### Step 2

Combine the gram flour and curry powder in a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water

Add the sliced onion to the bowl with the chopped coriander, chopped ginger and garlic and a drizzle of vegetable oil and mix until the onion is well coated – this is your onion bhaji mixture

Massage the mixture for 30 secs, squeezing the onions to form a thick mixture


### Step 3

Divide the onion bhaji mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, then shape into rough patties and add to a baking paper-lined baking tray and drizzle with vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min, turning once halfway, or until the bhajis are golden and crispy – these are your onion bhajis


### Step 4

Drain and rinse the chickpeas and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the drained chickpeas to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray with the smoked paprika, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until slightly crisp – these are your smoky chickpeas

Once done, remove the tray from the oven and allow to cool


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the cultured coconut and mint sauce in a bowl with a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your coconut raita

Top, tail and peel the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Stand the peeled mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone!


### Step 6

Slice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomatoes roughly

Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely


### Step 7

Wash the lamb's lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the lamb's lettuce to a bowl with the sliced cucumber, chopped tomato, sliced mango and smoky chickpeas

Add half of the coconut raita (save the rest for later!) and toss everything together – this is your mango & coconut salad

### Step 8

To serve, top the mango & coconut salad with the onion bhajis

Drizzle over the remaining coconut raita

Enjoy!
