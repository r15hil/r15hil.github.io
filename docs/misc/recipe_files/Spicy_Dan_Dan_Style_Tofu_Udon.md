A Sichuan classic, these fiery dan dan noodles aren’t for the faint of heart. You’ll crisp up tofu in Chinese 5 spice and soy before adding udon noodles and coating the lot in a sticky-spicy dan dan sauce. Now that packs a punch.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Crumble the drained tofu very finely

Combine the crumbled tofu and five-spice mix in a bowl with your umami seasoning and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt  – this is your umami tofu


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the umami tofu (reserve the bowl!) to the pan and cook for 12-14 min or until golden and crispy, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go – this is your crispy tofu


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour and remaining soy sauce in the reserved bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat go easy!), hoisin sauce, tahini and rice vinegar

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of salt – this is your dan dan-style sauce


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 5

When the tofu is nearly ready, add your udon noodles to a bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside to soak for 1-2 min, then stir to separate the noodles

Drain the soaked noodles


### Step 6

Once the tofu is crispy, reduce the heat to medium

Add the dan dan-style sauce and cook for 30 secs or until thickened


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the drained noodles and blanched peas and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy dan dan-style tofu udon

### Step 8

Serve the spicy dan dan-style tofu udon and top with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
