## Description

This super simple lamb dish is inspired by the Greek island of Paros. You'll caramelise the lamb mince, courgette and butter beans with stock and honey so that it crisps up and goes sweet and salty. Served over dill-flecked bulgur wheat, with fresh mint to garnish. Make sure you drizzle it with olive oil at the end.

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chopped courgette and&nbsp;sliced red onion&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften and brown&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of salted boiled water (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 3

Once the courgette and onion&nbsp;are&nbsp;done,&nbsp;transfer them to a plate and set aside


Return the pan to a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;lamb mince&nbsp;and cook&nbsp;for 3-4 min or until&nbsp;browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, drain&nbsp;and rinse the butter beans


Add the drained butter beans to the pan and cook for a further 2 min or until the beans have started to caramelise and brown


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the mint leaves finely, discarding the stalks&nbsp;


Cut the cherry tomatoes in half


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Stir the&nbsp;dried&nbsp;dill&nbsp;and cherry tomatoes&nbsp;into the drained bulgur&nbsp;wheat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper &ndash;&nbsp;this is your dill-flecked&nbsp;bulgur&nbsp;


### Step 7

Return the courgette&nbsp;and onion to the pan with the lamb&nbsp;


Add the honey and stir to coat the mince evenly, then remove from the heat


Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed
