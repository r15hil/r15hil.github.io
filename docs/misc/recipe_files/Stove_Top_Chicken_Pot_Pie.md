## Ingredients

- 0 chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 160g puff pastry
- 50g soft cheese
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 2 white potatoes
- 160g blanched peas
- 1 carrot
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Heat a medium-sized pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the diced onion and chopped potato to the pot with the diced carrot and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has started to soften

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for a further 1-2 min

Add the chicken stock mix and soft cheese to the pot with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then carefully score inside the border in a criss-cross pattern


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the scored puff pastry and cook, covered, for 8-10 min on each side or until the pastry is cooked through, puffed up and golden

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!


### Step 7

Once cooked through and golden, transfer the cooked puff pastry to a clean chopping board and slice in half – these are your pie lids

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add the blanched peas and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your stove-top chicken pot pie

### Step 8

Serve the stove-top chicken pot pie with a pie lid on top

Enjoy!
