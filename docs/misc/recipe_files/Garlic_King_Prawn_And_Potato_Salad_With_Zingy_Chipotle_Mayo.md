Add the chopped onion and chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with the dried oregano, ground cumin and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and golden and the onion has softened

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail, peel and grate you carrot[s]

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 5

Drain your sweetcorn

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char

Once starting to char, transfer to a bowl to cool slightly, reserving the pan – this is your charred sweetcorn

### Step 7

Meanwhile, drain the quick-pickled red onion and reserve the pickling liquid

Combine your mayo and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the pickling liquid in a small bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your zingy chipotle mayo

Once the potatoes and onion are cooked, add them to the salad mix with the charred sweetcorn and give everything a good mix up – this is your potato & sweetcorn salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the potato & sweetcorn salad in bowls and top with the garlic king prawns and quick-pickled red onion

Drizzle over the zingy chipotle mayo and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
