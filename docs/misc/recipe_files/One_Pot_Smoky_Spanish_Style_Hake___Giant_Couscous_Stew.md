## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into rings


### Step 3

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin, then chop roughly

Add the sliced pepper and chopped garlic to the dish with your ground smoked paprika, bay leaf[ves] and cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 4

Drain and rinse your chickpeas and add them to the dish with your chopped tomatoes and black olives and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and add 450ml<span class="text-purple"> [580ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [760ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven, add your giant couscous and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Top with your hake fillet[s]


### Step 7

Return the dish to the oven for 12-15 min further or until the couscous is tender and the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

To serve, break the fish up into rough bite-sized pieces and tear your parsley & dill all over – this is your one-pot smoky Spanish-style hake & giant couscous stew

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Dig in!
