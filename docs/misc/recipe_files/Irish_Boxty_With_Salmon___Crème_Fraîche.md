## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 100g crème fraîche
- 100g salmon flakes
- 3 white potatoes
- 5g chives
- 1 pot of honey (25g)
- 1 British free-range egg
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop half of the potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Grate the remaining potatoes (skins on)

Peel strips of zest from the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with a peeler

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot and mash until smooth


### Step 3

While the potatoes are boiling, add the grated potato to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can

Add the grated potato to a bowl with the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and 40g<span class="text-danger"> [80g]</span> flour<span class="text-danger"> </span>and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your potato mixture


### Step 4

Chop the chives finely

Combine the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemony dressing


### Step 5

Cut 2 pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper

Place 1 piece on a baking tray and add the salmon flakes to one side

Drizzle the honey over the salmon flakes

Add the cherry tomatoes and lemon zest to the other side with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with the other piece of foil and scrunch the edges to form a sealed parcel


### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until the tomatoes have softened

Meanwhile, add the potato mixture, egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 1.5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>milk to the mashed potatoes and mix until well combined – this is your batter


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, dollop 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> spoonfuls of batter into the pan then and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the mixture looks set on top

Tip: Cooking for 4? Do this in batches!

Once set, flip and cook for 1-2 min on the other side – these are your boxty

### Step 8

Serve the boxty stacked on top of each other with the salmon flakes, crème fraîche and chopped chives over the top

Wash the lamb's lettuce and serve it to the side with the roasted tomatoes

Drizzle the lemony dressing over the lamb's lettuce

Serve the remaining lemon wedges to the side

Enjoy!
