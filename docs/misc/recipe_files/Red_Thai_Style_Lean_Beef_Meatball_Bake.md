## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop half your shallots into wedges, then slice the remaining shallot[s] finely

Chop your potatoes[s] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel then chop your sweet potato[s] into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] at an angle


### Step 2

Add the shallot wedges, sliced carrot and all the chopped potatoes to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the potatoes have started to brown

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

While the potatoes are in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut half your red chilli[es] into rounds

Cut the remaining chilli in half, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 4

Add your lean beef mince to a bowl with the chopped shallot, half the chopped garlic, half the chopped ginger (you'll use the rest later!) and a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the lean beef mince into 3 per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape them into meatballs


### Step 5

Dissolve your coconut cream and red Thai curry paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add your fish sauce, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining chopped garlic and ginger and stir everything together – this is your red Thai curry stock

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 6

Remove the tray from the oven and spoon away any excess oil

Add the meatballs, halved green beans, cardamom pods and lime leaves to the tray and pour the red Thai curry stock over everything

Return the tray to the oven for 15 min further or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce is thick and rich – this is your red Thai-style beef meatball bake


### Step 7

Once done, remove the lime leaves and give the red Thai-style lean beef meatball bake a good mix up in case the sauce has separated a little

### Step 8

Serve the red Thai-style lean beef meatball bake and garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!
