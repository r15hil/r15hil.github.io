## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice, sultanas, half the ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana rice


### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your chickpeas

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 3

Add the drained chickpeas to a food processor with 3/4 of your curry powder, remaining ground turmeric and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> cold water

Add your tahini, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] with a very generous pinch of salt and blitz for 1-2 min or until fully combined and smooth – this is your curried hummus

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash is fork-tender


### Step 5

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a large bowl with your white wine vinegar, ginger paste and chopped coriander

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your ginger slaw


### Step 6

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 7

Add a small knob of butter to the cooked squash with the remaining curry powder and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your curried squash

### Step 8

Serve the curried squash with the sultana rice, curried hummus, ginger slaw and wilted spinach to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge, flaked almonds and coriander leaves

Enjoy!
