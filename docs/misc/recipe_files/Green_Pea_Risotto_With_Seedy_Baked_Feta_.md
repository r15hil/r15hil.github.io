## Ingredients

- 160g arborio rice
- 1 soft cheese pot (50g)
- 100g Feta Cheese
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 160g blanched peas
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 leek
- 15g pumpkin seeds 
- 5g dill
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water

Once the leek is beginning to soften, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the Chinese rice wine, then slowly add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for an initial 15 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle

Tear the dill roughly, including the stalks

Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them

Add most of the peas (save some for garnish!) to a food processor with the torn dill, soft cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz into a purée – this is your pea purée


### Step 5

Cover a baking tray with a thin coat of olive oil

Tip: Use some kitchen paper to help you spread it evenly!

Cut the feta in half and add it to the oiled tray

Top the halved feta with the pumpkin seeds (don't worry if some of them spill over the side!)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden – this is your seedy baked feta


### Step 6

Once the rice has been cooking for approx. 15 min, add the grated Italian hard cheese to the pan, give everything a good stir and cook for 2-3 min further

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 7

Add the pea purée and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Continue to cook for a final 7-8 min or until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your green pea risotto

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the green pea risotto in bowls

Break the seedy baked feta over the top and garnish with the reserved peas and lemon wedges

Enjoy!
