### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray

Drizzle the chicken breast portion[s] with olive oil and sprinkle over your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 2

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add most of the diced onion (save some for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened

Once thickened, stir through your soured cream and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your creamy chipotle salsa
