## Ingredients

- 11g beef stock mix 
- 80g cheddar cheese
- 6 lasagne sheets
- 32g tomato paste 
- 250g British lean beef mince (<5% fat)
- 15ml Henderson's Relish

- 15ml balsamic vinegar

- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened

Boil half a kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the lean beef mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Dissolve the beef stock mix, tomato paste, Henderson's Relish, dried oregano and a pinch of sugar in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Once the beef has browned, tear the chestnut mushrooms into the pan with your hands

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your ragù


### Step 6

Meanwhile, melt 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir through half the grated cheese – this is your béchamel


### Step 7

Layer some of the ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with 3 lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets (you may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish)

Cover with the béchamel, top with the remaining grated cheese and cook in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked

### Step 8

Combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Wash the mixed leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the lean beef lasagne with the mixed leaf salad to the side and the dressing drizzled over and enjoy!
