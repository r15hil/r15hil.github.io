## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the mince is cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half your lime with your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime yoghurt


### Step 4

Once the beef has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your honey and cook for 2-3 min or until the beef becomes crispy, sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky lean beef mince chilli


### Step 5

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Fluff the brown rice with a fork and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Build your burritos by layering up a warmed tortilla with some brown rice, a spoonful of chopped tomato and shredded lettuce and a dollop of the sticky lean beef mince chilli

Sprinkle over some grated cheese and a drizzle of lime yoghurt, then roll your burritos up tightly

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
