## Description

You might normally associate Chinese food with greasy takeaways or hangover grazing. Not so with this dish inspired by Chef Remi's favourite New York-style Chinese meal, Ma Po Tofu. The texture is soft and nourishing, with a hint of garlic and ginger, and a silky black bean sauce. Chinese food has never felt so healthy!
