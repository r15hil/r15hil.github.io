- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Cod fillet x0
- Curry powder (1tbsp)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp) x0
- Ground turmeric (0.5tsp)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 18-20 min


### Step 2

Pat your cod fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle 2/3 of your curry powder (save the rest for later!) over the fish and rub it into both sides until evenly coated

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – these are your curried cod fillet[s]


### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Once the potatoes have had an initial 18-20 min, add the pepper strips and cherry tomatoes to the tray[s]

Sprinkle over the remaining curry powder and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Place the curried cod fillet[s] on top of the veg

Return the tray[s] to the oven and increase the heat to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 for a further 12 min or until the fish is cooked through, the potatoes are crisp and the vegetables have softened – this is your one tray curried cod bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Whilst everything is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt with your ground turmeric, a small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your turmeric yoghurt


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the one tray curried cod bake with the turmeric yoghurt drizzled over the top

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
