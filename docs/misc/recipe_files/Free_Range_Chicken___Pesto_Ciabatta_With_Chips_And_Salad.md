### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, add the chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Once everything is ready, wash and pat your salad dry with kitchen paper

Add half your salad (you'll use the rest later!) to the pesto dressing with the tomato wedges and give it a good mix up – this is your pesto dressed salad

### Step 8

To assemble, fill the warmed ciabatta halves with the seasoned chicken, pesto mayo and the remaining salad – these are your free range chicken & pesto ciabatta

Serve the pesto dressed salad and chips to the side

Enjoy!
