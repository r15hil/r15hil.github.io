## Description

Sometimes the most comforting dishes are the best, and this one is a pub classic for a reason! You'll serve sweet and salty roast ham with chunky chips, a perfectly gooey egg, creamy mustard mayo and a side salad, using the coolest salad leaf around: baby kale. (Gluten and dairy-free, suitable for coeliacs.)

## Ingredients

- 21g wholegrain mustard
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (30ml)
- 1 x 300g British baby gammon joint
- 25g honey
- 300g potatoes 
- 50g baby kale
- 2 British free-range eggs

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Pat the baby gammon dry with kitchen paper


Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the gammon and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over


### Step 2

<span class="text-highlight">While the gammon is cooking, cut</span> the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips


Add the chunky chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Once the gammon has browned, cut out a large sheet of tin foil, place the gammon in the middle and scrunch up the edges so that any cooking juices can be collected


Add the tin foil to the baking tray with the chips


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and the gammon is cooked through (you will be glazing it halfway through with the honey)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, wholegrain mustard and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your mustard mayo


### Step 5

Once the gammon has been cooking for 15 min, drizzle the honey over and return it to the oven for the remaining cooking time


Once cooked, transfer the gammon to a clean board and leave to rest for 5 min, keep any cooking juices for later


### Step 6

Only continue with this step once the gammon is resting!


Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat 


Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan


Cover with a lid and cook for 2 min or until done to your liking


Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!


### Step 7

<span class="text-highlight">While the eggs are cooking,</span> combine the baby kale and the honey gammon juices in a bowl <span class="text-highlight">and toss it all together</span>

### Step 8

Slice the rested honey glazed gammon finely


Serve the sliced gammon with the eggs, chips, dressed baby kale and mustard mayo


Enjoy!
