## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the shallot is softening, pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Chop the smoked basa into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Once the shallot has softened, add the chopped garlic and curry powder with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 80ml<span class="text-purple"> [120ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> milk and cook for 2 min further or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your curried béchamel


### Step 5

Once the curried béchamel has thickened, add the grated cheddar, drained sweetcorn and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 2 min further or until the cheese is melted – this is your curried cheesy corn


### Step 6

Line a separate baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork


### Step 7

Top the pastry with the chopped basa then spoon over the curried cheesy corn

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the filling is bubbling and golden – this is your curried, cheesy corn & smoked basa tartlet

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drizzle a little olive oil and your white wine vinegar over the salad – this is your dressed salad

Top the curried, cheesy corn & smoked basa tartlet with the sliced spring onion and serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
