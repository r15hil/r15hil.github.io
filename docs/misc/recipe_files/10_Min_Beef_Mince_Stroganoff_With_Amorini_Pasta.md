## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef mince to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the mince is cooking, add the quick cook amorini pasta to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the amorini for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the amorini and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 4

Once the mince has started to brown, roughly tear the chestnut mushrooms into the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your beef stock


### Step 6

Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the smoked paprika and roasted garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the beef stock and cook for 1-2 min further

Meanwhile, roughly chop the chives


### Step 7

Add the Dijon mustard and sour cream and cook for 1 min until everything is warmed though

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your beef mince stroganoff

### Step 8

Serve the beef mince stroganoff over the amorini pasta

Sprinkle with the chopped chives and enjoy!
