### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips to the dish and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

### Step 7

After an initial 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Serve the oven baked Greek cheese, tomato & chicken farfalle seasoned with a generous pinch of pepper
