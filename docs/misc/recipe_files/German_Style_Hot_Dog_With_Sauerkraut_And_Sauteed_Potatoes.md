## Ingredients

- 0 mayonnaise
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 200g jolly dog pork sausage
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 18g Dijon mustard
- 2 hot dog buns
- 0 Dijon mustard
- 0 cider vinegar
- 3 white potatoes
- 3.8g yellow mustard seeds
- 5g chives
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chives finely


### Step 2

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your yellow mustard seeds and cook for 30 secs or until sizzling

Once sizzling, add the sliced red onion and your shredded red cabbage and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a separate pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

Once the onion and cabbage have softened, add half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot, cook for a further 30 secs then set aside to cool

Combine your mayo and Dijon mustard in a separate bowl – this is your mustard mayo


### Step 5

Add your pork sausage[s] to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sausage[s] is cooked through


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min, stirring occasionally, or until golden and crisp

Once golden, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 30 secs or until fragrant – these are your sauteed potatoes


### Step 7

Add the remaining cider vinegar to the cooled cabbage with a grind of black pepper and half the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your sauerkraut

Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun

Remove the tray with the sausage[s] from the oven

Add the cut hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the tray, then return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill each warmed hot dog bun with some mustard mayo, a sausage and some sauerkraut

Serve the sauteed potatoes to the side with the remaining sauerkraut and remaining mustard mayo

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
