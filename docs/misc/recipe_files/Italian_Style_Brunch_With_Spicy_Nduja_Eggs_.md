### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until beginning to brown

### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 3

Slice your ciabatta[s] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, tomato and pepper to the pan with your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften

### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Once the pepper has begun to soften, add the stock to the pan with the spinach, half the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up

Season with a grind of pepper and cook for 7-8 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened – this is your 'Nduja pepper sauce

### Step 6

Once the chopped potato is slightly brown, remove from the oven, then add the ciabatta slices to the other side of the baking tray[s] with a generous drizzle of olive oil and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – these are your cheesy ciabatta slices

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1643201883281-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a separate, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan, then cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Season with a grind of black pepper

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

### Step 8

Serve the 'Nduja pepper sauce with the crispy potatoes and cheesy ciabatta slices to the side

Top with the fried eggs and garnish with the remaining chopped basil – this is your Italian-style brunch with spicy 'Nduja eggs

Enjoy!
