## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and boil a kettle

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges and slice the cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the onion wedges and halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 4

Once starting to soften, add the ginger & garlic paste and curry powder to the pan with the tomatoes and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 5

Dissolve the creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 400ml<span class="text-danger"> [750ml] </span>boiled water

Add the coconut stock to the pan and bring to the boil


### Step 6

Chop the pollock fillets into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped pollock to the pan and cook for an initial 2-3 min


### Step 7

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan with the pollock and cook, covered, for a further 2 min or until the spinach has started to wilt and the pollock is cooked through â€“ this your curried pollock, cherry tomato & spinach soup

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the medium egg noodles in bowls, pour over the curried pollock, cherry tomato & spinach soup and garnish with the crispy onions

Enjoy!
