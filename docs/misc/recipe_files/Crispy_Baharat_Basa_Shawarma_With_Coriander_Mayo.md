### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped potatoes and half your baharat (you'll use the rest later!) to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your spiced potatoes

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

### Step 3

Combine the sliced shallot and half your white wine vinegar in a large bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar and mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Combine the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and chopped coriander in a small bowl with your mayo, the remaining white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander mayo

### Step 4

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper, then chop in half, lengthways

Add your cornflour to a plate with the remaining baharat and a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Firmly press the chopped basa into the cornflour mixture, making sure to evenly coat on both sides – this is your coated basa

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy baharat basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are almost done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your naan[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3 min further or until warmed through

Meanwhile, add the shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and a drizzle of olive oil to the bowl with the quick-pickled shallot and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1681381408260-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Cut 1 large piece of tin foil per person, then lay each warmed naan onto a piece of foil

Add the crispy baharat basa down the middle of each naan, then top with some of the tomato salad and drizzle over the coriander mayo

Fold the naan around the filling, widthways, using the tin foil to hold everything together – this is your crispy baharat basa shawarma

### Step 8

Serve the crispy baharat basa shawarma with the spiced potatoes, the remaining tomato salad and any remaining coriander mayo to the side

Enjoy!
