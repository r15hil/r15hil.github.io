## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 1 tomato paste sachet (16g)
- 1 can of black beans
- 30g Greek feta cheese
- 1 avocado
- 6 seeded tortillas
- 10g coriander
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 lime
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Chop the cherry tomatoes roughly


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)


### Step 2

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways and remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon


Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon and add it to a food processor with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime


Blitz until smooth, then stir through the chopped tomatoes with 3/4 of the chopped onion, half the coriander, half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt – this is your chunky guacamole


### Step 3

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the remaining chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


Drain and rinse the black beans


### Step 4

Once softened, add the drained black beans to the onion with the tomato paste, ground cumin, smoked paprika, and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) 


Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-8 min or until thickened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the seeded tortilla wraps to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, crack the eggs<span style="color:#e86754;"> </span>into the pan


Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking


### Step 7

Once the beans have thickened, add the juice of the remaining lime with a pinch of salt


Add the remaining chopped coriander and stir it all together – these are your spicy beans

### Step 8

Serve the spicy beans over the crispy seeded tortillas


Dollop over the chunky guacamole and top with a fried egg


Crumble the feta cheese all over and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves 


Enjoy!
