## Description

Here’s an easy twist on an Italian classic. You’ll swap rice for orzo pasta, and simmer tomatoes and garlic until you get a rich, jammy sauce. Add sliced courgette and juicy prawns, before sprinkling with feta to serve. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dice your tomatoes roughly


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and diced tomato with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 7-8 min or until the tomato has completely softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs on the diagonal


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once softened, add your tomato paste and orzo to the pan with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the grains are fully coated


### Step 6

Add the courgette discs with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 12-15 min, stirring continuously, or until the stock is almost fully absorbed and the orzo is cooked with a slight bite


### Step 7

Drain your king prawns, increase the heat to medium-high, then add them to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until cooked through – this is your king prawn, tomato & courgette orzotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little dry

While the prawns are cooking, chop your chives finely

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn, tomato & courgette orzotto and crumble your feta over the top

Sprinkle over the chopped chives and season with a very generous grind of black pepper

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and enjoy!
