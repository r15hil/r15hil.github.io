## Ingredients

- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Meatless Farm sausages (6pcs)
- Marmite (8g)
- Sweet potato x2
- Spring greens (150g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Drizzle a baking tray with vegetable oil and add your meat-free sausages

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 3

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the foil around the spring greens to form a tightly sealed parcel


### Step 4

Once the sausages have had an initial 10 min, add the spring greens parcel[s] to the tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min further or until the spring greens are tender and the meat-free sausages are cooked through


### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and your Marmite in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your Marmite stock


### Step 6

Heat a small pan with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Add the Marmite stock to the pan, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your Marmite gravy


### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is cooked, drain and return to the pot

Add a knob of butter and mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free sausages over the sweet potato mash with the spring greens to the side

Drizzle over the Marmite gravy

Enjoy!
