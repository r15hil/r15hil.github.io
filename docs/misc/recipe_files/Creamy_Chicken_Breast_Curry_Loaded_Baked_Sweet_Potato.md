## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Pierce your sweet potato[es] with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 6-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the softened sweet potato[es] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt


### Step 2

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the skin is crispy

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for an initial 2-3 min or until slightly browned

Once slightly browned, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until softened


### Step 4

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and curry powder to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min

While the onion is softening, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste and stir it all together – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach


### Step 6

Once the curry has thickened, add the wilted spinach and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your creamy chicken breast curry

Once the potatoes are cooked, add your cashew nuts to the tray and return it to the oven for a further 2-3 min or until the cashews are golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 7

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Cut the baked sweet potato[es] in half, lengthways, and fill with the creamy chicken breast curry

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted cashew nuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
