## Ingredients

- 45g free-from mayonnaise
- 15ml tamari soy sauce
- 10g coriander & parsley
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 1 cauliflower
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 50g rocket
- 1 shallot
- 3 spring onions
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 30g pumpkin seeds

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>thick steaks from the centre of the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(keep any leftovers, chop them into florets, then roast for a tasty snack!)

Add the cauliflower steaks to a baking tray, then drizzle the tamari soy sauce all over and put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden and tender, turning once halfway


### Step 2

Chop the waxy potatoes in half and add them to one side of a separate baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 3

Chop the parsley and coriander roughly

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then chop the spring onions in half

Cut the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then chop each half into 3 pieces


### Step 4

Once the potatoes have had 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the chopped pepper and halved spring onions with a drizzle of olive oil

Return the tray to the oven for 15 min further or until the peppers are softened and charred and the potatoes are crisp


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the chopped herbs to a pestle & mortar with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt

Grind to a course paste, then add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with the red wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the chopped shallot

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir – this is your chimichurri


### Step 6

Combine the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with the mayo – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 7

Once the cauliflower steaks are almost done, sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over the tray and return it to the oven for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the cauliflower steaks with the rocket, charred veg and crispy potatoes to the side

Drizzle the chimichurri all over the steaks, garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds and serve with a dollop of garlic mayo and enjoy!
