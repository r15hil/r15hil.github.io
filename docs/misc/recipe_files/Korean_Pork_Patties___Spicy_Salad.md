## Description

These Korean pork patties are inspired by tteok-galbi, small oblong beauties flavoured with miso and onion and cooked in a sweet, sticky sauce. We've served this with fragrant basmati rice and a kimchi-inspired spicy salad. Seoul food! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 carrot
- 100g basmati rice
- 250g British pork mince
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 2 mayonnaise sachets
- 25g honey
- 1 tbsp chipotle paste 
- 1 tbsp white miso paste
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 2 spring onions
- 4 soy sauce sachets (32ml)
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and grate the&nbsp;brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Combine the pork mince with the grated onion, miso paste and panko breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up until fully combined


Divide the pork mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>&nbsp;and shape into&nbsp;patties&nbsp;


Pop them in the fridge until later


Tip: chilling the patties will help them hold their shape when you cook them


### Step 3

Add the basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the chilled patties and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until browned on both sides


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, chipotle paste (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted sesame oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl &ndash; this is your Korean dressing


Combine the soy sauce and honey in a separate bowl


### Step 6

Shred the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Trim, then slice the spring onions finely


### Step 7

Once the patties&nbsp;have browned, add the soy &amp; honey&nbsp;to the pan


Cook for a further 3-4 min, turning the patties frequently so that they are coated in the sticky glaze


Add the shredded lettuce, carrot ribbons and spring onions to the Korean dressing and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Serve the Korean patties over the rice, spoon over any remaining sauce and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds


Serve the spicy&nbsp;salad to the side


Enjoy!
