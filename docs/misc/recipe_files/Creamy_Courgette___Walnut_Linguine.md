## Instructions


### Step 1

Bash your walnuts in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don’t lose any!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat, once hot, add the bashed walnuts, panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until golden, then set aside (reserve the pan!)

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 2

While the breadcrumbs are cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat the reserved pan with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add the sliced courgette and sliced garlic to the pan

Cook for 10-12 min or until the courgette is beginning to soften, stirring occasionally


### Step 5

Once the courgette is nearly softened, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Once the courgette has softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min or until the liquid has evaporated

Once evaporated, add your single creamy soy, vegetable stock mix, Dijon mustard and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 5-6 min, or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream-like consistency


### Step 7

While the sauce is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Once thickened, add the drained linguine, half the basil (save some for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy courgette linguine

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy courgette linguine topped with the walnut crumb

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
