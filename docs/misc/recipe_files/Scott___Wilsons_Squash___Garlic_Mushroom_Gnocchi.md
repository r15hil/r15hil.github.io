### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Add the butternut squash cubes to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt, a drizzle of olive oil and a splash of water

Tip: The water helps to cook the squash quicker!

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until fork-tender
