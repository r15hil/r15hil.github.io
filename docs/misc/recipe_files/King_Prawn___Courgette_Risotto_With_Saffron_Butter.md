Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

When the rice is almost cooked, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with your Chinese rice wine and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through


### Step 7

Once the prawns are cooked through, stir through your grated Italian hard cheese, a small pinch of salt and a knob of butter – this is your king prawn & courgette risotto
