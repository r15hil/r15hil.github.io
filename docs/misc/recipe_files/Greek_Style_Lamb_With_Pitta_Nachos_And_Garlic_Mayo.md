## Ingredients

- British lamb mince (250g)
- Red onion
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Baharat (1tsp)
- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- Ground sumac (1tsp)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened


### Step 2

While the onion is cooking, chop your wholemeal pitta[s] into triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over your dried oregano

Season with a large pinch of salt and drizzle generously with olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until crisp and golden – these are your pitta nachos


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add your lamb mince with your baharat, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 7-8 min or until the lamb is browned all over and cooked through (no pink meat!), breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go – this is your Greek-style lamb


### Step 4

While the lamb is cooking, halve your cucumber lengthways then scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon, discard the seeds

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Add half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your ground sumac, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, a pinch of salt and a splash of boiled water and stir until dissolved

Add in the sliced cucumber and remaining sliced onion, give it a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled salad


### Step 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your mayo to a bowl with your chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), the remaining red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give it a good stir – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 7

Add the chopped tomato to the quick-pickled salad and gently mix together

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style lamb, with the pitta nachos, quick-pickled salad and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
