## Ingredients

- Tomato ketchup (30ml)
- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Mayonnaise (25ml)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Spring onion x2
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- Basa fillet x0
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your paprika wedges


### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, chop your basa fillet[s] lengthways into finger-width strips

Pat dry with kitchen paper – these are your basa goujons


### Step 3

Add your cornflour to a bowl with your vegetable stock mix, dried oregano, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining ground smoked paprika

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your spiced cornflour


### Step 4

Add the basa goujons to the spiced cornflour

Give everything a good mix up until the basa goujons are fully coated, then set aside – these are your coated basa goujons


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 6

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a large bowl with your mayo and the sliced spring onions and mix it all together – this is your creamy slaw


### Step 7

When the wedges are almost ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa goujons and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your southern fried basa goujons

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the southern fried basa goujons with the paprika wedges, creamy slaw and a dollop of ketchup to the side

Enjoy!
