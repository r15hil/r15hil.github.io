### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 2

While the pine nuts are toasting, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chop into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large chunks

### Step 3

Heat the reserved pan with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine and onion wedges with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the veg is starting to brown

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the veg is starting to brown, add the chopped pepper, tomato wedges and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your dried oregano, sultanas and red wine vinegar and cook for 1 min or until the vinegar has evaporated

### Step 5

Once the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the veg is tender

### Step 6

While the veg is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add your couscous and a generous pinch of salt to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1684234890413-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the veg is tender, add your capers to the pan and cook, uncovered, for a final 2 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your Sicilian-style aubergine stew

While the sauce is thickening, fluff the cooked couscous with a fork, then stir most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and the toasted pine nuts through the couscous with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your pine nut couscous

### Step 8

Serve the Sicilian-style aubergine stew over the pine nut couscous

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
