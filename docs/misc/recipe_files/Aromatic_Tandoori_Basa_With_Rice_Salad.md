## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 0 basa fillet
- 0 white basmati rice
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 0 curry powder
- 130g basmati rice
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Pre-heat the grill to a high heat

Add your basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, rinse the rice under cold running water until cool and leave to drain


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Combine your curry powder, half of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a very generous pinch of salt in a bowl

Add the basa pieces and give everything a good mix up until the fish is evenly coated – this is your coated basa


### Step 3

Drizzle a baking tray with vegetable oil (to prevent the fish from sticking)

Add the coated basa to the tray and put it under grill for 6-7 min or until the fish is cooked through and starting to char – this is your tandoori basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the remaining natural yoghurt and mayo to a small bowl

Zest your lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(try to grate lightly and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half

Peel and finely grate (or chop) the garlic

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), lime zest and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the yoghurt – this is your lime & garlic yoghurt


### Step 5

Slice your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out the inner seeds using a teaspoon and discard

Slice the cucumber halves finely


### Step 6

Pick your coriander and mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Chop your mint and coriander leaves roughly


### Step 7

Add the rinsed rice, nigella seeds, sliced cucumber, shredded red cabbage and most of the chopped coriander and mint (save the rest for garnish!) to a large bowl

Squeeze the juice of the lime[s] into the bowl with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori basa over the rice salad

Drizzle the lime & garlic yoghurt all over and garnish with the remaining chopped mint & coriander

Enjoy!
