- 300g potatoes 
- 1/2 tsp spicy cayenne pepper
- 5g fresh mint 
- 60g panko breadrcrumbs
- 1 shallot
- 15g caper buds
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)
- 1 lemon 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Cut the potatoes&nbsp;(skins on) into thick chips and add them to a lightly oiled baking tray


Drizzle with vegetable&nbsp;oil and season with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> of the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Chop the capers finely


Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half&nbsp;


Add the chopped shallot,&nbsp;capers and&nbsp;mayonnaise to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;lemon juice&nbsp;


Mix to combine - this is your tartare sauce&nbsp;


### Step 3

Roughly chop the green beans&nbsp;


Add them to a pot of salted boiled water and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and rinse them under cold water and set aside and keep the pan for later&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the panko breadcrumbs and cayenne pepper&nbsp;to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and mix it up


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl


Add 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> flour to another plate


Place all of the prawns in the flour (tap off any excess), add them to the beaten egg, then put them all into the bowl of panko and&nbsp;give them a good old mix up until they're coated


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and set aside them aside


Slice the remaining shallot finely


Return the pot to a medium heat with a knob of butter


Once hot, add the sliced&nbsp;shallot&nbsp;and cook over a medium-low heat for 4 min or until softened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the breaded prawns and cook for 1-2 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through (you may have to do this in batches) - this is your&nbsp;prawn scampi


Tip: add extra oil if your pan is looking dry


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Add the&nbsp;chopped green beans to the shallots


Rip the mint leaves into the pan and season with a pinch of salt


Cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through - these are your minted beans&nbsp;

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


Serve the prawn scampi with the chips and minted beans to the side&nbsp;


Garnish with a lemon wedge, and put your tartare sauce in a bowl for dipping!


Enjoy!
