### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, lets get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

While the chicken is cooking, combine your balsamic sundried tomato paste and your mayo in a small bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your balsamic tomato dressing

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, add the cooked potatoes and chopped tomato to a bowl with the torn lettuce and half of the balsamic tomato dressing (reserve the rest for later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this your dressed salad

### Step 7

Once the chicken is nearly ready, add your pumpkin seeds to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted and lightly golden – these are your toasted pumpkin seeds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 8

Serve the cooked chicken and torn mozzarella over your dressed salad – this is your chicken caprese salad

Drizzle with the remaining balsamic tomato dressing and sprinkle with the toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!
