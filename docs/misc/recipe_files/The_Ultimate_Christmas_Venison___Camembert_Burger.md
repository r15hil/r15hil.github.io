## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (30ml)
- 2 brioche rolls
- 100g Brussels sprouts
- 1 camembert (125g)
- 1 Dijon mustard pot (5.5g)
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 x venison & pork burgers (227g)
- 1 cranberry sauce pot (40g)
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 bag of dried cranberries (30g) 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips


Add the chunky chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Trim the Brussels sprouts and chop them in half


<span class="text-highlight">Add the chopped sprouts to a food processor and blitz for 30 secs or until finely shredded</span>


Tip: Don't have a food processor? Slice them finely instead!


Add the dried cranberries to a small bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soak

### Step 3

Add the shredded sprouts to a colander and pour the remaining boiled water all over them until bright green and wilted, then set aside to steam dry


Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pot and cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until golden and caramelised

### Step 4

<span class="text-highlight">Whilst the onions are cooking, line a baking tray with baking paper</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Add the venison &amp; pork burgers to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!)</span>

### Step 5

Whilst the burgers are cooking, drain the soaked cranberries and chop them finely 


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Add the chopped cranberries and shredded sprouts to a bowl with the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt and pepper 


Give everything a good mix up – this is your sprout &amp; cranberry slaw

### Step 6

<span class="text-highlight">Once the burgers are cooked, slice the mini camembert<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces</span>


Tip: Run your knife under hot water to stop it sticking to the cheese!


<span class="text-highlight">Top each venison &amp; pork burger with a camembert half and add the brioche rolls to the other side of the tray</span>


Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 7

<span class="text-highlight">Once the onions have caramelised, add the balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to the onion and cook for 1-2 min further or until the vinegar has been absorbed and the onions are sticky – these are your balsamic onions</span>

### Step 8

<span class="text-highlight">Fill each brioche roll with the balsamic onions, a venison &amp; pork camembert burger and a dollop of cranberry sauce</span>


Serve the sprout &amp; cranberry slaw and chunky chips to the side


Enjoy!
