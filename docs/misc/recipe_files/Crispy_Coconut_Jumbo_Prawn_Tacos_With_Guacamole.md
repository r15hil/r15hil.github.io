### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Add a pinch of salt and sugar to a bowl with a splash of boiled water and stir everything together until dissolved

Once dissolved, add the cider vinegar and sliced green chilli and set aside to pickle – this is your pickled chilli

### Step 2

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon

Add the avocado to a bowl and mash it with a fork

Season with a pinch of salt, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime – this is your guacamole

### Step 3

Wash and chop the lettuce roughly, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Chop the coconut flakes finely

### Step 4

Drain, then pat the jumbo prawns dry with kitchen paper

Add a handful of flour to a bowl

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a separate bowl and beat with a fork

Combine the panko breadcrumbs and chopped coconut flakes in another bowl – these are your coconut breadcrumbs

### Step 5

Coat the jumbo prawns in the flour, tap off any excess, then add into the beaten egg and finally press into the coconut breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your breaded jumbo prawns

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1594128263934-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded jumbo prawns and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your crispy coconut jumbo prawns

Tip: Do the prawns in batches if you need to so you don't overcrowd the pan!

### Step 7

Whilst the prawns are cooking, add the tortillas to a baking tray (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)

Put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

To serve, pile the warmed tortillas with the guacamole, chopped lettuce, diced tomato and the crispy coconut jumbo prawns

Top with the pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
