## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper[s] and your ginger & garlic paste to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the pepper starts to soften


### Step 4

While the pepper is softening, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your black sesame seeds, then crack your egg[s] into the pan over the top of the seeds, then cook covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking – this is your sesame fried egg[s]

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 5

Once the pepper has softened, add your udon noodles and grated carrot to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until the carrot has softened slightly

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your mirin, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), cornflour and 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix until smooth – this is your spicy soy sauce


### Step 7

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Once the carrot has softened, add the edamame beans and spicy soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2-3 min until everything is warmed through and fully coated in the sauce – this is your veggie udon stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the veggie udon stir-fry with a sesame fried egg on top

Tear over your coriander and top with a grind of black pepper and any remaining black sesame seeds from the pan

Enjoy!
