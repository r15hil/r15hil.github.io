## Ingredients

- 2 x 200g British sirloin steak
- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 80g crème fraîche
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 8ml truffle flavoured extra virgin olive oil
- 3 white potatoes
- 2.5g cracked black pepper
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 2 shallots
- 150g cavolo nero

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 14-16 min or until very tender, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once hot, add the panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently – these are your crumbs

Once golden, transfer the crumbs to a bowl until ready to serve and reserve the pan for later


### Step 3

Return the cooked potatoes to a low heat with half the double cream (save the rest for later!), 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk and 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> knob<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of butter

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your pomme purée

Tip: For extra smooth pomme purée add to a food processor and blitz until very smooth

Set the pomme purée aside (keep it in the pot!), ready to reheat later


### Step 4

Remove the tough stalks from the cavolo nero, then wash and chop roughly

Line a baking tray with a large piece of tin foil

Add the chopped cavolo nero to the middle of the foil with a few small knobs of butter and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the cavolo nero to form a sealed parcel then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a high heat and pat the sirloin steaks dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with salt

Once very hot, add the seasoned steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a plate to rest (reserve the pan)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the shallots

While the steaks are resting, return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot with 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> knob<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of butter and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Add the remaining double cream, beef stock mix, cracked black pepper, Chinese rice wine and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[90ml] </span>boiled water

Cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your peppercorn sauce


### Step 7

Pour any resting juices from the steaks into the peppercorn sauce

Gently reheat your pomme purée, stirring frequently

### Step 8

Serve the sirloin steak and peppercorn sauce with the cavolo nero and pomme purée to the side

Sprinkle the crumbs over the pomme purée and drizzle with the truffle oil

Enjoy!
