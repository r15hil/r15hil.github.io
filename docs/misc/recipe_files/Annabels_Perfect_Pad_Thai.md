## Ingredients

- 80g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 bag of roasted peanuts
- 25g chilli jam
- 1 leek
- 25g honey
- 1 British free-range egg
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 British chicken breast fillet
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 24ml soy sauce
- 100g Thai rice noodles
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Add the rice noodles&nbsp;to a shallow dish and cover them with&nbsp;cold water&nbsp;until they're fully submerged


Set the rice noodles aside to soak and soften&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin strips&nbsp;


Combine the cornflour, honey and 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> soy sauce sachets in a large bowl


Add the chicken breast strips&nbsp;to the bowl, then set aside to marinate


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the brown&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of sugar and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning&nbsp;to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Add the soaked noodles to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook for 4-7 min or until tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and run them under cold water (this will stop them from sticking together!), then set aside&nbsp;


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the garlic and chicken and&nbsp;cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through


Meanwhile, wash the&nbsp;leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


Add the&nbsp;egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>to a bowl with a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and beat with a fork


Once the chicken is cooked, transfer everything to a plate and keep the pan


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil&nbsp;


Once hot, add the Tenderstem broccoli&nbsp;and sliced leek and cook for 4-5 min or until tender


Meanwhile, crush peanuts with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)


Once tender, push the vegetables to one side of the pan, add the beaten egg and stir for 1 min or until the egg is scrambled&nbsp;


### Step 7

Return the chicken and onion to the pan with the drained noodles, remaining soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar and&nbsp;chilli jam&nbsp;and give everything a good mix up


Cook for 2-3 min or until the noodles have warmed through&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the Perfect Pad Thai&nbsp;garnished with the&nbsp;crushed peanuts


Enjoy!
