- 400g potatoes
- 1 bag of pistachio nuts

- 30g sultanas

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Chop the pistachios coarsely


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Combine the lamb mince, garlic, sultanas, cumin and pistachios in a mixing bowl


### Step 2

Season the mixture generously with salt and pepper

Divide and roll into 6 <span class="text-danger">(12)</span> even balls, then refrigerate until step 5


Tip: Chilling the meat helps it hold its shape when cooking


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (with skins on) into bite-size chunks


Add the potatoes to a pot (with a matching lid) of salted boiling water


Boil on a high heat, covered, for 10-15 min or until you can pierce them easily with a fork


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Continue to peel lengths off the carrot until you have a pile of carrot 'ribbons' and grate the remaining core&nbsp;


Place the ribbons in a bowl of cold water &nbsp;


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> vegetable oil on a medium-high heat&nbsp;


When hot, add the meatballs and cook for 4 min or until browned&nbsp;


Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 8-10 min&nbsp;


Shake them about a bit for even cooking!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the pomegranate molasses in a large mixing bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(4 tbsp)</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


This is your pomegranate dressing


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are tender, drain and return them to the cooking pot&nbsp;


Add a knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth


Season generously with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Add the carrot ribbons (drained) and coriander to the dressing bowl and mix well


Serve the meatballs over the mash with the carrot salad to the side


Enjoy!
