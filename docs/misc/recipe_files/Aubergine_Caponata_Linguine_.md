## Ingredients

- 60g black olives
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 190g linguine 
- 20g capers
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 10g basil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine
- 1 pepper
- 30g sultanas 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put in the oven for 16-18 min or until the aubergine is golden


### Step 2

Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Chop the sultanas roughly

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and add the chopped sultanas – this is your sultana stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper and red wine vinegar to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften

Whilst softening, chop the olives, capers and basil roughly

Reboil a full kettle


### Step 5

Once the pepper has slightly softened, add the chopped tomatoes and sultana stock and give everything a good mix up

Add the chopped olives, capers, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has started to thicken


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the roasted aubergine to the pan with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and mix everything together – this is your aubergine caponata

Tip: Add more of the starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine caponata over the linguine and sprinkle over the grated cheddar cheese

Garnish with the remaining basil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
