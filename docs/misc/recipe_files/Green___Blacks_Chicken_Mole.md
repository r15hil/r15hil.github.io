### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6&nbsp;


Peel one whole onion and slice a few rings off it (as finely as you can)


Separate the onion rings, place them in a bowl of cold water and set aside


Tip: the cold water removes some of the harsh flavour from the raw onion&nbsp;

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]&nbsp;</span>vegetable oil, add the chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side until golden&nbsp;


Meanwhile, dice the remaining onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Transfer the coloured chicken to a baking tray, put it in the oven for 7-10 min or until slightly under cooked, then return the pan to a low heat, add a knob of butter and the diced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook until step 5

Transfer the chicken to the mole sauce and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened&nbsp;

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half

### Step 7

Shred the cooked chicken while in the pan (we like to use a knife and fork!)&nbsp;


Fluff the cooked rice and squeeze the juice of half the <span class="text-danger">[whole]</span>&nbsp;lime&nbsp;into it and mix in the coriander&nbsp;


Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the chicken mole over the rice&nbsp;


Garnish with the drained onion rings, a big dollop of Greek yoghurt and the lime wedges&nbsp;


Enjoy!
