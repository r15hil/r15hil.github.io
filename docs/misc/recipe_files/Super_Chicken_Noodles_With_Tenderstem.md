## Description

Big on flavour yet easy to make, this satisfying chicken noodle fix is all about the sweet, herby marinade. You'll create a simple umami-rich sauce, with extra zing coming from fresh ginger and crunch from the Tenderstem broccoli. Serve with sliced spring onion on top. (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Trim, then slice the spring onions finely


Strip the thyme leaves from the stalks and chop them finely (or if your stalks are soft, then just chop them up too)


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> chicken stock cube in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water


Combine the chicken stock,&nbsp;honey, soy sauce,&nbsp;chopped thyme, chopped&nbsp;ginger and half the spring onion&nbsp;(save the rest for later!) in a mixing bowl &ndash; this is your super&nbsp;marinade&nbsp;


Chop the&nbsp;Tenderstem broccoli into rough, bite-sized pieces &nbsp;


### Step 3

Chop the chicken thighs into thick strips


Add&nbsp;them to a mixing bowl with the cayenne pepper <span class="text-highlight">(Can't</span> handle the heat? Go easy!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil


Mix well and set aside


Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the chicken strips and cook for 5 min or until they're coloured


Tip:&nbsp;don't overcrowd the pan with the&nbsp;chicken or it will sweat instead of brown


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the wheat noodles to a pan and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged


Boil over a high heat for 5-7 min until cooked, then drain and set aside


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Stir half of the super&nbsp;marinade and 70ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water into the chicken, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 6 min&nbsp;


Add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min or until the chicken is cooked through and the broccoli is tender with a slight bite


### Step 7

Once done, add the drained noodles&nbsp;and remaining marinade to the pan with the&nbsp;cooked chicken and broccoli&nbsp;


Cook,&nbsp;uncovered, for a final 1-3 min or until the sauce sticks to the noodles

### Step 8

Serve the noodles and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion


Enjoy!
