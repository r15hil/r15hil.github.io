## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray(or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your nigella wedges


### Step 2

Combine your lamb mince and curry powder in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patties hold their shape whilst cooking) then shape into 1 patty per person– these are your curried lamb patty[ies]


### Step 3

Line a baking tray with tin foil

Add the curried lamb patty[ies] to the tray and put it in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 5

Combine the grated carrots and chopped coriander in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chopped salad


### Step 6

Slice your bread roll[s] in half

Once the potatoes are almost done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved bread roll[s] to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the bread has warmed through


### Step 7

Combine your natural yoghurt and your mango chutney in a bowl – this is your mango raita

### Step 8

To build, spread the mango raita over each bread roll base

Top with the curried lamb patties, some chopped salad and a bread roll lid

Serve the spiced wedges, remaining chopped salad and any remaining mango raita to the side

Enjoy!
