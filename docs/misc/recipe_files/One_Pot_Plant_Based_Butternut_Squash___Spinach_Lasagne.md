### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a medium-high heat

Once the lasagne is almost done, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Add your balsamic vinegar to a large bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the shredded lettuce to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

Pick your basil leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Garnish the lasagne with the basil leaves
