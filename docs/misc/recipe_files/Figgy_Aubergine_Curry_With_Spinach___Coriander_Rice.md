While the aubergine is in the oven, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered for an initial 10 min

Wash your spinach, then add and cook covered for a further 2-5 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Roughly chop your creamed coconut (if required!)

Combine your fig relish, chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your figgy coconut stock
