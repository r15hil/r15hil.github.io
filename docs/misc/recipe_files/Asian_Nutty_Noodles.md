## Description

Broccoli loves being dressed. Not in a suit, tie and jacket; cute as that might be. No, we’re talking about lusciously thick, sweet and salty dressings. Like this honey-ed sesame number with tahini. It’s naturally creamy and has an oaty, nutty base flavour, perfect for this simple, warm noodle dish.
