## Ingredients

- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Plain tofu (280g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- Cider vinegar (30ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain your tofu, pat it dry with kitchen paper and slice into 2 flat pieces per person

Add 80ml<span class="text-purple"> [120ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> milk to a shallow bowl with half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add the sliced tofu to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later


### Step 3

Slice your cucumber finely into discs

Add the cucumber discs and the remaining cider vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 4

Heat a small pot with 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together until fully combined with a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce


### Step 5

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Peel and grate your garlic

Add your mayo to a small bowl with your dried oregano, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style dip


### Step 6

Discard all the excess marinade from the tofu

Add your ground smoked paprika and cornflour to the bowl with the marinated tofu

Season with generous a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is fully coated


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crispy – this is your fried tofu

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread a little of the ranch-style dip on the base of the warmed brioche halves, top with a handful of the quick-pickled cucumber and the fried tofu, then drizzle the buffalo sauce over the top

Top with the warmed brioche bun lid and serve the fries with the remaining quick-pickled cucumber and ranch-style dip to the side

Enjoy!
