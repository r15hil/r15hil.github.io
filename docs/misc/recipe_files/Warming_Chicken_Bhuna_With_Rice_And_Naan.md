### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until starting to break down
