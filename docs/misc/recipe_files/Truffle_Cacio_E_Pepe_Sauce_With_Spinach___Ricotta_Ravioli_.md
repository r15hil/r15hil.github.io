## Ingredients

- 250g spinach & ricotta ravioli
- 60g grated Italian hard cheese
- 8ml truffle flavoured extra virgin olive oil 
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 2.5g cracked black pepper
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 40g Cornish clotted cream

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble in the chestnut mushrooms using your hands and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spinach & ricotta ravioli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Once the mushrooms are beginning to soften, add the cracked black pepper and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 5

Add the vegetable stock mix and clotted cream to the mushrooms and cook for 1 min or until the cream has melted


### Step 6

Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water to the sauce and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in most of the grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) – this is your cacio e pepe sauce

Add the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cacio e pepe sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli and drizzle over the truffle oil

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
