## Ingredients

- 80g mature cheddar 
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 200g linguine 
- 30g 3 seed mix
- 80g chestnut mushrooms 
- 40g basil
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to a high heat, then boil a kettle


(For a more interesting texture) rip the portobello and chestnut&nbsp;mushrooms&nbsp;into bite-sized pieces onto a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil&nbsp;then season generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Put the tray directly under the grill and cook for 12-15 min or until they're nicely caramelised


### Step 2

Add the 3 seed mix to a large pot&nbsp;over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted


Once toasted, set aside on a plate and keep the pot for later


### Step 3

Return the pot to a high heat


Add the linguine with plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Chop the basil finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Grate the cheddar cheese finely&nbsp;


### Step 5

Grind the chopped&nbsp;basil, chopped&nbsp;garlic and a pinch of salt in a pestle &amp; mortar to form a smooth paste


Add 2-3 tbsp olive oil and mix well


Tip: if you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop the basil very finely, then mix with olive oil


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Add the grated cheese to the basil with 2-3 tbsp olive oil


Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly &ndash; this is your pesto


### Step 7

Return the drained linguine to the pot with a splash of your reserved starchy cooking water


Stir the pesto and half of the caramelised&nbsp;mushrooms&nbsp;through and cook for 1 min or until the pesto has coated the pasta and the cheese has melted&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the linguine in bowls and garnish with the toasted 3 seed mix


Top with the remaining caramelised&nbsp;mushrooms


Enjoy!
