### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Take your lamb leg joint[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot (with a matching lid) with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges

While the potatoes are boiling, strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] into batons

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Add the drained potatoes to a baking paper-lined tray with half the chopped rosemary, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your roasties

Reboil the kettle

### Step 4

Meanwhile, remove the string from the lamb leg joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rub the lamb leg joint[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with the remaining chopped rosemary and a pinch of salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned lamb to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned on all sides

### Step 5

Once browned, transfer it to a baking tray and reserve the pan

Once the potatoes have been cooking for 20 min, put the tray with the lamb in the oven for 8-9 min for rare, 10-12 min for medium-rare and 12-14 min for medium

Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board to rest for 3 min before slicing – this is your roast lamb

### Step 6

While the lamb is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix and red wine paste in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your beef stock

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter and once melted, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and mix until a paste forms, then whisk in the beef stock and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened – this is your red wine gravy

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1677845818086-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the carrot batons with a large knob of butter, a small pinch of salt and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until the carrots are tender with a slight bite

Once tender, add your blanched peas and half your mint sauce (save the rest for later!) and stir until warmed through – these are your minty peas & carrots

### Step 8

Serve the roast lamb with the roasties and minty peas & carrots to the side and pour the red wine gravy all over

Serve the remaining mint sauce to the side

Enjoy!
