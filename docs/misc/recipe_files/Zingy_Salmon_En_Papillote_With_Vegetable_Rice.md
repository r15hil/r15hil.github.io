### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 3

Combine the chopped ginger, mirin, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl and give it a good mix – this is your zingy marinade

### Step 4

Cut 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>A3 size sheets of baking paper (or tin foil) per person

Lay your salmon fillet[s] in between 2 sheets (doubling it up prevents any leakages!) and add the parcels to a baking tray

Spoon the zingy marinade over each fillet evenly

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 5

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the salmon to form a sealed parcel[s]

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through – this is your zingy salmon en papillote

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then slice the spring onion[s] finely

Peel the carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

### Step 7

Once the rice is nearly tender, add the chopped garlic and your sugar snap peas to the same pot

Cook for a further 5 min before draining everything

Once drained, season lightly with salt and pepper and stir through the carrot ribbons until they've softened slightly – this is your vegetable rice

### Step 8

Serve the zingy salmon en papillote with the vegetable rice to the side

Pour any remaining zingy marinade all over and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
