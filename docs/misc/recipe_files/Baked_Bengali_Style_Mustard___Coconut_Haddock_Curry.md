## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Peel and slice your shallot[s]


### Step 3

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Once the shallot is slightly softened, add your curry powder and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and chopped creamed coconut to the dish with your wholegrain mustard and ginger & garlic paste


### Step 5

Add your fish sauce with your vegetable stock mix and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven and cook, uncovered, for an initial 22 min or until thickened – this is your mustard & coconut curry sauce


### Step 6

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, making sure all the rice is fully submerged

Cover very tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the curry sauce has thickened, remove the dish from the oven and stir through the spinach, then add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and a pinch of pepper

Gently stir it all together and return the dish to the oven for 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through – this is your baked Bengali-Style mustard & coconut haddock curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the baked Bengali-Style mustard & coconut haddock curry with the baked rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Dig in!
