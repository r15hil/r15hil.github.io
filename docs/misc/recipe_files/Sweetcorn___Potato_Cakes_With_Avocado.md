Season with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweetcorn potato mixture

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the patties to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp – these are your sweetcorn & potato cakes

Tip: You may need to do this in batches!

While the patties are cooking, cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>in half lengthways and remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of its skin using a spoon and slice finely

Wash the lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Divide the lamb's lettuce between plates and top with the sliced avocado, sweetcorn & potato cakes and tomato salsa

Drizzle over the chilli lime dressing and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
