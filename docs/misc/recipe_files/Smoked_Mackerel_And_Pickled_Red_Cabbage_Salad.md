## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Drain and rinse your butter beans

Once hot, add the drained butter beans to the pan with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your shredded red cabbage in a bowl with your cider vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up and set aside until later – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage

Remove the skin from your smoked mackerel fillet[s] and discard

Tear the mackerel into small, bite-sized pieces directly into the pan with the butter beans and cook for 1-2 min further or until warmed through

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside


### Step 4

While the mackerel is cooking, cut your lemon[s] into quarters

Add the juice of 1/4 of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon quarter[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a bowl along with your tamari soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your tamari dressing


### Step 5

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Slice your apple[s] (no need to peel!) finely, discard the core[s]


### Step 6

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain the quick-pickled red cabbage, discard the liquid

Add the sliced apple to a bowl with the quick-pickled red cabbage and salad

Pour in the tamari dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage & apple salad


### Step 7

Add the chopped parsley and juice of 1/4 of the lemon quarter[s] to the pan with the mackerel and mix it all together – this is your lemony mackerel & butter beans

### Step 8

Serve the quick-pickled red cabbage & apple salad with the lemony mackerel & butter beans over the top – this is your smoked mackerel and pickled red cabbage salad

Garnish with the remaining lemon quarters, season with a grind of black pepper and top with a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
