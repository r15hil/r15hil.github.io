## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tofu to a large bowl with half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), a good grind of black pepper and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your marinated tofu


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated tofu and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Once golden, transfer the tofu to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped pepper and the tomato wedges with a pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add your tomato paste, ginger paste and the chopped garlic, cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your remaining soy sauce with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water, a squeeze of lime juice and the golden tofu

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your fragrant Vietnamese-style tomato tofu


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant Vietnamese-style tomato tofu with the cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the chopped coriander and a wedge of lime

Enjoy!
