## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 tomato paste sachet (32g)
- 1 agave nectar pot (25g)
- 1 can of jackfruit (565g)
- 1 free-from mayonnaise pot (45g)
- 1 can of black beans (185g)
- 4 large tortillas
- 100g basmati rice
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 soy sauce sachet (8g)
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Add the basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Drain the jackfruit and tear into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the torn jackfruit with the smoked paprika, ground cumin, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), agave nectar, soy sauce and pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min

Add the tomato paste with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened to a pulled pork consistency


### Step 4

Whilst the jackfruit is cooking, chop the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly

Combine the free-from mayo with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime and season with a pinch of salt


### Step 5

Once the rice is cooked, stir the drained black beans through the rice and season with a pinch of salt – this is your beany rice

Once the jackfruit is almost done, add the large tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 6

Top each warmed tortilla with the beany rice, pulled jackfruit, shredded lettuce and lime mayo (the filling should be just off of the centre of the tortilla!)

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!


### Step 7

To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you're left with a burrito – these are your pulled jackfruit burritos

Use sheets of tin foil to hold everything together

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the pulled jackfruit burritos and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
