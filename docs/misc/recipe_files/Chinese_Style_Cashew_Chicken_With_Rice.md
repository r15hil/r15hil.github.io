### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] in half lengthways then slice diagonally into half-moons

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into small, bite-sized pieces, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and garlic

Add your diced chicken thighs to a bowl with your cornflour and and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken thighs and your soy sauce to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until the chicken has started to brown and crisp

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 5

Once the chicken is lightly browned, add the sliced carrot[s], chopped pepper[s] and half of the chopped spring onion[s] (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2-3 min until softened

Once the carrot and red pepper have softened, add the chopped ginger, garlic and your cashew nuts and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add another splash of water if it's looking a little thick!

### Step 7

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style cashew chicken over the cooked rice

Enjoy!
