## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and boil a kettle

Add most of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried oregano to a large bowl

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and give it a good mix up – this is your spicy marinade


### Step 2

Drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the spicy marinade and gently mix together until the prawns are fully coated – these are your marinated prawns

Set aside for later


### Step 3

Whilst the prawns are marinating, rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot until serving


### Step 4

Meanwhile, roughly chop your cherry tomatoes

Wash and shred your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon, scoop the avocado out of the skin[s] using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways

Add it all to a bowl and give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad


### Step 5

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] in half


### Step 6

Add the chopped coriander, remaining chopped garlic, natural yoghurt and the juice of half your lime[s] to a food processor

Add a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your lime & coriander yoghurt

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the coriander and garlic as finely as you can then mix it all together in a small bowl


### Step 7

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated prawns and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your spicy jumbo king prawns

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Add a pinch of salt to the cooked quinoa and give it a good mix up

Serve the spicy jumbo king prawns with the quinoa and salad

Drizzle the lime & coriander yoghurt all over and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
