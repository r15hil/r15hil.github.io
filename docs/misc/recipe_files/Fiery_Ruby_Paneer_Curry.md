## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped paneer and cook for 3-5 min or until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring


### Step 3

While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 4

Once the paneer is golden, reduce the heat to medium-low and add a drizzle of vegetable oil with the chopped garlic and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your ground smoked paprika, garam masala and curry powder and cook for 1 min or until very fragrant


### Step 5

Add the stock and your chopped tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 6

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice lengthways finely – this is your julienne chilli

Wash your spinach


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the spinach and your clotted cream (save a generous drizzle for a garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a final 1 min or until the spinach was wilted – this is your ruby paneer curry

### Step 8

Serve the ruby paneer curry and top with the julienne chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
