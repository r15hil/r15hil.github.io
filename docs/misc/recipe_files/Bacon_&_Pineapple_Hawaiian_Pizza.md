### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Drain your pineapple chunks

Tip: Keep the pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!
