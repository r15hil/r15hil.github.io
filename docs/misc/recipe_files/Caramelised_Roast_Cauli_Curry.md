## Description

By roasting the cauliflower rather than boiling, you caramelise its flavour into something milky, nutty and addictive. This is the base ingredient for our delicate vegetable curry which is naturally low G.I. and full of goodness. (Naturally gluten-free, but unsuitable for coeliacs).
