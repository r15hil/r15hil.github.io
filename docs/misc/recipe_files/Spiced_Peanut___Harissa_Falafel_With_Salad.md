## Ingredients

- 1 harissa paste sachet (40g)
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 25g agave nectar
- 200g sweet potatoes
- 80g spinach 
- 1 can of chickpeas
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 26g peanut butter
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 soy sauce sachet (8ml)
- 30g pumpkin seeds
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6


Drain the chickpeas


Add the drained chickpeas, panko breadcrumbs, harissa paste, peanut butter, ground cumin and a very generous pinch of salt to a food processor and blitz until smooth


Tip: if you don't have a processor, mash everything with a potato masher until smooth


### Step 2

Divide the chickpea mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> portions and shape them into falafel balls<br />


Add the falafel balls to one side of an oiled baking tray<br />


### Step 3

Chop the sweet potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized cubes


### Step 4

Add the sweet potato cubes to the falafel baking tray 


Drizzle the falafel and sweet potato cubes with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sweet potatoes and falafel are soft and starting to brown


Tip: gently turn the falafel and potato halfway through so they cook evenly


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


Peel and grate the garlic 


Combine the soy sauce, grated garlic (Don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, agave nectar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon dressing


### Step 6

Trim and slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Halve the cherry tomatoes


### Step 7

Wash, then pat the baby leaf spinach dry


Once the falafel and sweet potato cubes are ready, drizzle the spinach with the lemon dressing and give everything a really good mix up


Tip: use clean hands to toss the salad to make sure every leaf is coated!

### Step 8

Divide the dressed spinach between bowls and top with the cherry tomato halves, sweet potato and falafel 


Garnish with the sliced spring onion, pumpkin seeds and a lemon wedge


Enjoy!
