## Ingredients

- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 6 porky black pudding sausages
- 15ml Henderson's Relish 
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 apple
- 150g spring greens
- 2 spring onions
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel, core and roughly chop your apple[s]

Add your pork & black pudding sausages to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put them in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the chopped apple to a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 80ml <span class="text-purple">[105ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook, covered, over a medium heat for 10-12 min or until the apple has softened

Once done, transfer the softened apple to a bowl with a knob of butter (reserve the pan) and mash until smooth – this is your apple sauce


### Step 3

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and set aside, reserve the pot for later


### Step 4

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into small pieces


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a knob of butter and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then stir in 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with your Henderson's Relish, beef stock mix and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy


### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add a large knob of butter

Once melted, add the sliced spring onions, sliced spring greens and a small splash of cold water and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite


### Step 7

Once the greens are tender, return the drained potatoes to the pot with a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of pepper and mash until the potatoes are smooth – this is your colcannon

### Step 8

Serve the pork & black pudding sausages over the colcannon with the apple sauce to the side

Pour the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!
