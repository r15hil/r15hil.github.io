## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 160g butternut squash cubes
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 100g salmon flakes
- 130g giant couscous
- 15g flaked almonds
- 20g harissa paste
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 5g parsley
- 1 brown onion
- 30g sultanas

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash is fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the ground coriander, ground turmeric and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the cooked butternut squash, sultanas, giant couscous and veg stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the giant couscous is tender – this is your Morrocan-style pilaf


### Step 5

While the pilaf is cooking, heat a separate large dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add the flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 6

Combine the natural yoghurt and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your harissa yoghurt

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once the couscous is tender, top the Morrocan-style pilaf with the salmon flakes and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the salmon is warmed through – this is your Morrocan-style salmon & giant couscous pilaf

### Step 8

Serve the Morrocan-style salmon & giant couscous pilaf with a dollop of the harissa yoghurt

Sprinkle over the toasted flaked almonds and chopped parsley

Enjoy!
