### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Add your pepper[s] (leave them whole!) to a baking tray (no need for oil) and cook for 20-25 min or until the skin is slightly blackened

Tip: This gives the pepper a nice smoky flavour!

Once done, remove the blackened pepper from the oven, slice in half and set aside to cool

### Step 2

While the pepper is cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Add the chopped garlic, ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), pomegranate molasses and half of your walnuts (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon

Chop the remaining walnuts roughly

### Step 5

Once cooled, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) the halved blackened pepper and discard the top[s]

Peel off the skin (clean hands is the best way!), then roughly chop the peeled pepper

Add the chopped peeled pepper and panko breadcrumbs to the food processor with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and a pinch of salt and blitz until a smooth thick paste has formed – this is your muhammara dip

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 7

Fluff the cooked, drained bulgur wheat with a fork

Add the juice of the remaining lemon and half of the chopped herbs (save the rest for garnish!)

Season with pepper – this is your herby bulgur

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the herby bulgur with the salad and muhammara dip to the side

Tip: Use the back of a spoon to spread the dip on the plate

Top with the golden halloumi

Garnish with the remaining chopped herbs and walnuts and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
