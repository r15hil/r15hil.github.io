- British skinless chicken thighs (160g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Roasted garlic paste (15g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0

- Garlic clove x3
- Soft cheese (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your garlic to a piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil, then scrunch the foil around the garlic to form a tightly sealed parcel

Add the parcel to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the garlic has softened – this is your roasted garlic


### Step 2

While the garlic is cooking, boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and roasted garlic paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy garlic stock

Once the chicken has browned, add the creamy garlic stock to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for a further 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dice your tomato[es]

Combine your white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your dressing


### Step 6

Carefully squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins and mash with a fork, discard the skins


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken back to the pan with the mashed roasted garlic, drained tortiglioni and a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy roasted garlic & pulled chicken tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the creamy roasted garlic & pulled chicken tortiglioni

Serve the salad and diced tomato to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!
