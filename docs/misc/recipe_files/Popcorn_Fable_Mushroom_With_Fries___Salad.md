### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Combine your vegan mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with half your honey and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)– this is your sweet & spicy mayo

### Step 3

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar and remaining honey in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressing

Add the chopped fable mushrooms and mix until fully combined

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with a pinch of salt and stir it all together – these are your coated mushrooms

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until crisped and cooked through

Once cooked through, season with a generous pinch of salt – these are your popcorn Fable mushrooms

### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the lettuce into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the popcorn Fable mushrooms with the fries and sweet & spicy mayo to the side

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side, drizzle over the dressing and top with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
