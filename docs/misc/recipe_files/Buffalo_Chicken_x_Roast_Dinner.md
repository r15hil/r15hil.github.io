### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air 

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper then coat them with the smoked paprika, ground coriander, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 6 min or until the skins have slightly crisped

### Step 2

Peel your potatoes and cut into quarters

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped potatoes to one side of a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 3

Add the sliced leek to the middle of a large piece of tin foil with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a small knob of butter and mix everything together

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the leek to form a sealed parcel and add it to the baking tray

Once the chicken is slightly crispy, transfer it to the baking tray, reserve the pan and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Fill 2 holes per person of a muffin tray with a very small drizzle of vegetable oil (about 1 tsp per hole) and put it in the oven for 8 min to heat up

Tip: No muffin tray? Fill a small oven-proof dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to make one giant Yorkshire!

Meanwhile, combine your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with 35g <span class="text-purple">[50g] </span><span class="text-danger">[70g]</span> flour and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk in a jug, then whisk in your dried oregano, remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt – this is your batter

### Step 5

After 8 min, carefully remove the muffin tray from the oven and evenly drizzle the batter into the hot oil

Return the tray to the oven for 20 min until puffed up and golden – these are your ranch Yorkshires

### Step 6

Boil half a kettle

Chop your chives finely

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[260ml]</span> boiled water with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your Henderson's Relish – this is your buffalo stock

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1660751703383-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a generous knob of butter

Once melted, add your cornflour and cook for 30 secs

Add the buffalo stock with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 2-3 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your buffalo gravy

### Step 8

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean chopping board and cut into strips – this is your roast chicken

Serve the roast chicken with the roast potatoes and ranch Yorkshires

Sprinkle the chopped chives over the leeks and serve to the side

Drizzle the buffalo gravy all over

Enjoy!
