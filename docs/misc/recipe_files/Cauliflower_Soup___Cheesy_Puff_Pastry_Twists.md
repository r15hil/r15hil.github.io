### Step 3

While the cauliflower is in the oven, boil a kettle

Heat a large pot with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, crumble in the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and pour in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Carefully remove the skins from the roasted garlic cloves (beware, they will be hot!)

Add most of the roasted cauliflower (save some florets for garnish!) and roasted garlic to the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-7 min or until everything has softened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the puff pastry lengthways into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> strips

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Twist each pastry strip from the ends in opposite directions until they look like a spiral and add them to the baking paper

Roughly sprinkle over the grated hard Italian cheese

### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven and cook the pastry twists for 5-6 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your cheesy puff pastry twists

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1581614793557-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the vegetables have softened, add the crème fraîche to the pot and stir to combine

Remove the pot from the heat and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Tip: For the smoothest results, use a food processor!

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy cauliflower soup

Tip: Add a splash of water if you think the soup is a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy cauliflower soup in bowls, garnished with the reserved cauliflower florets, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Serve with the cheesy puff pastry twists to the side

Enjoy!
