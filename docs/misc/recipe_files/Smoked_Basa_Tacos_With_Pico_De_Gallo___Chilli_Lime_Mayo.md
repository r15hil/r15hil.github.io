## Ingredients

- 2 tomatoes
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 6 plain tortillas
- 400g canned black beans
- 20g chipotle paste
- 10g coriander
- 2 x 100g smoked basa fillets
- 1 shallot
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Chop the tomatoes roughly

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 3

Drain and rinse the black beans

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 4

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat 

Once hot, add the drained black beans with the chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a splash of cold water and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the basa fillets with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your pan-fried smoked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, add the chopped tomatoes, sliced shallot and chopped coriander to a large bowl with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your pico de gallo

Combine the mayo with the chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the juice of the remaining lime in a small bowl – this is your chilli lime mayo


### Step 7

Once the beans have softened, add a generous knob of butter or butter alternative and mash them until smooth – these are your quick refried beans

Add the tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

### Step 8

To assemble your tacos, divide the quick refried beans, pan-fried smoked basa and pico de gallo equally between the warmed tortillas

Enjoy!
