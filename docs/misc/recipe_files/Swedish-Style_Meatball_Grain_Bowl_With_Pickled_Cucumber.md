### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with your dried cranberries and plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving – this is your cranberry brown rice

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, slice your cucumber finely into discs

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your cider vinegar, half the chopped dill (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt

Mix it all together and set aside to pickle – this is your dill quick-pickled cucumber

### Step 3

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and half the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 5 meatballs per person – these are your pork meatballs

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pork meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, reserving the pan

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining diced onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, Henderson's Relish and Dijon mustard in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1702388123169-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min

Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and cook for 2-3 min until slightly thickened

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1702388127178-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15<span class="text-danger"> </span>min further or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Swedish-style meatballs & gravy

### Step 8

Serve the Swedish-style meatballs & gravy with the cranberry brown rice and dill quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Pour any remaining gravy over the meatballs and add a dollop of your cranberry sauce on top

Garnish with the remaining chopped dill

Enjoy!
