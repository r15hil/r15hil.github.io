## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Add the spelt to a pot of boiled water over a high heat


Cook for 15-20 min or until cooked through but with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water until cool


### Step 2

Meanwhile, zest the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a bowl


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces


Add the sliced chicken to the bowl of lemon zest with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


Give everything a good old mix up


### Step 3

Add the chicken with any&nbsp;remaining marinade to a baking tray&nbsp;


Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, top and tail the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel lengths of courgette until you end up with a pile of courgette 'ribbons'


### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Cut the&nbsp;red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop Ô¨Ånely


Strip the mint leaves and chop them finely, discarding the stems&nbsp;


### Step 6

Combine the chopped garlic, chopped chilli (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 1 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp]</span> olive oil


Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and half the mint leaves (save the rest for later!) &ndash; this is your lemony dressing&nbsp;


### Step 7

Gently wash and pat the lamb's lettuce dry


Add the lamb's lettuce, courgette ribbons, cooked spelt and remaining mint leaves to a very large mixing bowl


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, pour over the lemony dressing and give everything a good old mix up


Remove the cooked chicken from the oven and slice it finely

### Step 8

Serve the courgette, chilli &amp; mint salad topped with the sliced chicken


Garnish with the pumpkin seeds


Enjoy!
