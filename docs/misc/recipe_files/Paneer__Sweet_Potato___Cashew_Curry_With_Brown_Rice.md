### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 4-5 min or until the potato is fork-tender

### Step 3

Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped paneer to a bowl with your cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated paneer to the pan with your cashews and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

Boil half a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Once the paneer and cashews are starting to brown, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic to the pan

Add your curry powder and ground turmeric and stir it all together

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix to the pan with your chopped tomatoes

Add a generous pinch of sugar and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Add the cooked sweet potato to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your paneer, sweet potato & cashew curry

### Step 7

Whilst the curry is cooking, squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the paneer, sweet potato & cashew curry over the cooked brown rice

Chop your coriander roughly over the curry with scissors

Enjoy!
