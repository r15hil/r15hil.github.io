## Ingredients

- Spring greens (150g)
- Red wine paste (10g)
- Mint (5g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Thyme (5g)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your turkey breast joint[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray, top with a knob of butter and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 36-38 min or until cooked through (when the juices run clear and there's no pink meat!)

Tip: Set a timer because your turkey will rest until everything else is ready!


### Step 2

While the turkey is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip the thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs


### Step 3

Melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40]</span> butter in a medium sized pot over a medium heat, then once melted, add half the chopped garlic and half the chopped thyme (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pot from the heat, add the potato discs and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the potatoes are coated in the butter mixture

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Divide the buttered potato discs between 3 holes per person of a muffin tray (or two!)

Pour over any remaining butter mixture and press the potatoes down (reserve the pot)

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – these are your pommes Anna

Tip: No muffin tray? Fill a small oven-proof dish to make one giant pomme Anna!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, melt a knob of butter in the reserved pot over a medium heat

Add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your red wine paste

Gradually add the stock and remaining chopped thyme to the pan and cook for 10-12 min, stirring frequently, until thickened – this is your thyme gravy


### Step 6

Wash your spring greens, then rip the leaves off, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Once the turkey is cooked through, transfer it to a clean chopping board to rest until everything else is ready

Add any remaining juices from the tray to the thyme gravy


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced spring greens and your blanched peas with the chopped mint and remaining chopped garlic

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the spring greens are tender – this is your spring veg

Warm up the thyme gravy over a low heat, then slice the roast turkey finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced roast turkey with the pommes Anna and spring veg to the side and pour over the thyme gravy

Enjoy!
