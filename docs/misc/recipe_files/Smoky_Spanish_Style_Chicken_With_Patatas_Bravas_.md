## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 1 tomato
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 4 white potatoes
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut them into thick strips

Peel and roughly slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the veg is soft and tender


### Step 3

While the veg is in the oven, boil half a kettle

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy tomato stock


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced tomato with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes have broken down

Add the spicy tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened – this is your bravas sauce


### Step 5

While the sauce thickens, cut the chicken breast portions in half lengthways

Combine the ground coriander, smoked paprika, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your smoky spice mix

Add the halved chicken breasts to the smoky spice mix and mix until they are fully coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until the chicken is slightly blackened on the outside and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky Spanish-style chicken


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the mayo, chopped garlic, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your aioli

### Step 8

To serve, top the roasted veg with the smoky Spanish-style chicken with the crispy potatoes to the side

Spoon the bravas sauce over the crispy potatoes – this is your patatas bravas

Drizzle the aioli all over the patatas bravas

Enjoy!
