### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, lets get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

### Step 3

While the noodles are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the turkey mince with the ginger & garlic paste and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop the mangetout in half roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed)

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Once the noodles are almost cooked, add the halved mangetout and cook for 1 min or until just cooked with a bite

Once cooked, drain the noodles & mangetout and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water
