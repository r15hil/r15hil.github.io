### Step 1

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the onion softens, boil a kettle

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 750ml<span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the sultanas to a small bowl, cover them with boiled water and set them aside


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and ras el hanout and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Rinse the red lentils and add them to the pan with the coconut stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are cooked and the sauce has thickened – this is your Moroccan-style lentil stew


### Step 5

While the stew thickens, drain and rinse the chickpeas

Add the drained chickpeas to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Sprinkle over the ground sumac and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – these are your roasted chickpeas


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discarding the stems

Drain the soaked sultanas and chop them roughly

Combine the halved tomatoes, chopped mint and chopped sultanas with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato & sultana salsa


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style lentil stew in bowls, topped with the roasted chickpeas and tomato & sultana salsa

Garnish with a wedge of lemon

Enjoy!
