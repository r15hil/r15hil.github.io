## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar, reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 6-7 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 2

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 3

Combine your soft cheese in a bowl with your wholegrain mustard, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>boiled water, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your soft cheese mix

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Line half a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry to the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife (the border will puff up and form a nice crust)


### Step 5

Spread your soft cheese mix over the pastry within the border and top with the caramelised onion (save the pan), chopped spinach and pumpkin seeds, then crumble over your feta

Add the chopped potatoes to the other side of the tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your dried oregano and a pinch of salt, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up, and the potatoes are golden – this is your spinach & feta tart and crispy potatoes


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add your cherry tomatoes with your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have started to blister – these are your balsamic tomatoes


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your dressing

Once the tart is done, add the salad to the dressing and give it a good mix up

### Step 8

Cut the spinach & feta tart in half

Serve the spinach & feta tart with the crispy potatoes, dressed salad and balsamic tomatoes to the side

Enjoy!
