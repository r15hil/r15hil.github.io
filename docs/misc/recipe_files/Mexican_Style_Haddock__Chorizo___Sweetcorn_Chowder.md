## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crispy


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the chorizo is crispy, add the chopped onion, diced pepper and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[330ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[330ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock


### Step 4

Once the red onion has softened, add the chopped sweet potato, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and cornflour to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy stock and cook for 10-12 min over a medium heat or until slightly thickened


### Step 5

Whilst the sweet potato is cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once slightly thickened, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the pan and cook, covered for a further 10-15 min or until the sweet potato is tender and the haddock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the haddock is cooked, add the drained sweetcorn with the juice of half your lime[s] and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your Mexican-style haddock, chorizo & sweetcorn chowder

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style haddock, chorizo & sweetcorn chowder with the toasted ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
