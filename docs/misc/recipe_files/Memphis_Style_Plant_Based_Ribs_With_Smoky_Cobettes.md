### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-16 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Soak the skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking) and take 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter alternative out of the fridge and set aside to warm up

Combine 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), with half the smoked paprika and half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your vinegar mop

Tip: In Southern BBQ a mop sauce is used to baste barbecued meats to infuse the meat (or meat-free!) with flavour while it cooks

### Step 3

Cut each meat-free burger into 3, so you end up with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> meat-free portions

Shape the meat-free portions into rib shapes, then thread 3 meat-free ribs onto 2 skewers so that you are left with a rack of meat-free ribs

Follow the same process with the remaining meat-free ribs and remaining skewers until you end up with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> meat-free rib racks

### Step 4

Add the meat-free rib racks to a baking paper-lined baking tray and drizzle over half the vinegar mop (or use a cooking brush!)

Add the sweetcorn cobettes to the side of the baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until beginning to char

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 5

While everything's in the oven, add the agave and smoked sea salt flakes to the remaining vinegar mop and stir it together – this is your smoky glaze

Combine the remaining cider vinegar, mustard ketchup and mayo in a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and whisk everything together – this is your potato salad dressing

Add the remaining smoked paprika to the warmed butter alternative and mix together – this is your smoky butter alternative

### Step 6

Trim then finely slice the spring onions and chives

After an initial 15 min, remove the meat-free ribs from the oven and pour the smoky glaze all over (or use a cooking brush!)

Add half the smoky butter (you'll use the rest later!) to the cobettes and return the tray to the oven for a final 5-6 min

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1650985782658-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While everything is in the oven, add the cooked potatoes, sliced spring onions and half the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) to the potato salad dressing and gently stir everything together – this is your potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the Memphis-style meat-free ribs with the potato salad and smoky cobettes to the side

Add the remaining smoky butter alternative to the cobettes and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
