## Ingredients

- 250g gnocchi
- 400g canned butter beans
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 5g chives
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 80g baby leaf spinach
- 2 garlic cloves
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add the portobello mushrooms to a tray and drizzle over the soy sauce

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the mushrooms are cooked through and tender


### Step 2

Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, peel and roughly chop the garlic

Drain and rinse the butterbeans

Dissolve the veg stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add half the drained butterbeans and the chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has softened


### Step 4

Once softened, transfer the butterbeans & garlic to a blender, reserving the pan

Add the veg stock and a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your 'creamy' sauce

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Return the pan to a high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, tear the chestnut mushrooms straight into the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown

Add the remaining butterbeans and the gnocchi and cook for a further 5-6 min or until everything is starting to crisp


### Step 6

Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min

Add the spinach, 'creamy' sauce and Dijon mustard and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened

Season to taste, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your 'creamy' mushroom gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash more water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 7

Chop the chives finely

### Step 8

Serve the 'creamy' mushroom gnocchi in bowls and top with a roasted portobello mushroom

Garnish with the chopped chives and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
