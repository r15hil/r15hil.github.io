### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a pinch of both salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until they're browned

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds, then cut the remaining red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, add your wholewheat noodles to a large pot, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles, and reserve the pot

### Step 5

Wash your spring greens, then rip the leaves off, discard the tough stalks, and layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and shred the chicken apart with two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Once pulled, return the pan to a medium heat and add the chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), hoisin sauce, half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>water and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken is coated in a sticky sauce – this is your pulled hoisin free range chicken thigh

### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until starting to wilt

Add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 2 min or until completely wilted, then stir in the cooked noodles, toasted sesame oil and remaining soy sauce – these are your sesame noodles

### Step 8

Serve the pulled hoisin free range chicken thigh over the sesame noodles

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds, chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
