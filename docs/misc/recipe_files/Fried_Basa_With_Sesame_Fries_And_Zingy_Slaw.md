### Step 2

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and soy sauce to a medium bowl – this is your marinade

Add your basa strips and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later – this is your marinated basa

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until they're cooked through and crisp

### Step 4

Grate your radishes

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

### Step 5

Add the sliced spring onion, grated carrot and grated radish to a small bowl

Add your rice vinegar and mix to combine – this is your zingy slaw

Combine your mayo with your hoisin sauce in a small bowl – this is your hoisin mayo

### Step 6

Drain and discard any excess marinade from the marinated basa

Add your cornflour to the bowl and stir it all together so the basa strips are fully coated in cornflour – this is your coated basa

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side until browned and cooked through – this is your fried basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Sprinkle the fries with your toasted sesame seeds – these are your sesame fries

### Step 8

Serve the fried basa with the sesame fries and zingy slaw to the side and the hoisin mayo for dipping

Enjoy!
