- 1 pot of creme fraiche (100g)
- 1 roasted garlic paste sachet (15g)
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 100g British shredded ham hock

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready


Skim through these steps


Wash your fruit and veg


Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!


Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


Trim, then slice the spring onions roughly


Tip: Chop them in a bunch for speed!


### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the sliced spring onion and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 sec or until fragrant


Add the gnocchi and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 4

Dissolve the crème fraîche in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock


### Step 5

Once the gnocchi has browned, add the creamy stock and cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until the gnocchi has softened


Tip: Don't worry if your sauce looks a bit thin, the cheese and ham will thicken it later!


### Step 6

While the gnocchi softens, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your balsamic dressing


### Step 7

Once the gnocchi has softened, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the ham hock and half the grated Italian hard cheese 


Season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your creamy ham hock gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the creamy ham hock gnocchi with the baby leaf salad to the side


Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad and sprinkle the gnocchi with the remaining cheese


Enjoy!
