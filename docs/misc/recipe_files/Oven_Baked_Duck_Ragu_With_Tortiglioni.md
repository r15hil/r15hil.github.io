## Ingredients

- 11g beef stock mix
- 1 tomato
- 10g red wine paste
- 32g tomato paste
- 150g tortiglioni
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 2 cooked British duck legs
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add the duck legs (including the duck fat and duck jelly!) to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until the duck legs are golden and crispy


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thick slices

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Cut the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges


### Step 4

Add the chopped onion to the dish with the tomato wedges and crushed garlic

Season with a pinch of salt and stir everything together


### Step 5

Add the tomato paste, bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves] </span>and 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> flour to the pot with 600ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water

Stir in the red wine stock, beef stock mix and tortiglioni and give everything a good mix up

Nestle the pasta into the water as much as you can, then stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked through – this is your ragu base

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the duck legs to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Discard all the bones

Add the pulled duck to the ragu base with a generous grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your oven-baked duck ragu with tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the oven-baked duck ragu with tortiglioni in the centre of the table

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and season with black pepper

Let everyone dig in!
