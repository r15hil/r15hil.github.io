## Description

Tabbouleh, pronounced 'tab-boo-lay', is a bulgur wheat salad, traditionally served as part of a mezze. We love the wholesome feel from the spiced beef mince, bulgur, fresh cucumber, cherry tomatoes, parsley and lemon all tumbled together. The perfect quick and easy meal!

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Carefully discard any excess oil from the pan, then stir in your ras el hanout and cook for 1 min

Sprinkle in your beef stock mix and add a splash of cold water, then give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 4-6 min or until the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the mince is cooking, dice your cucumber finely

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Add your honey to the cooked beef and continue to cook for 1 min further before removing the pan from the heat to cool slightly – this is your spiced beef mince


### Step 6

Add the cooled bulgur to a mixing bowl with the diced cucumber and halved cherry tomatoes

Add a drizzle of olive oil and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon[s], then gently mix it all together


### Step 7

Add the spiced beef mince and most of the chopped parsley (save a pinch for garnish!) to the bulgur and gently fold through

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your tabbouleh-style spiced beef salad

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the tabbouleh-style spiced beef salad and top with the reserved chopped parsley

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
