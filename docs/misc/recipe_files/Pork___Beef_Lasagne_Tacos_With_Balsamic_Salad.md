## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork & beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the chopped onion and diced carrot and cook for a further 4 min or until the veg has softened and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Whilst the veg is softening, grate your cheddar cheese

Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the veg has softened, add the chopped garlic, dried oregano and bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the pan and and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and Henderson's Relish with a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your bolognese filling


### Step 5

Meanwhile, melt 10g<span class="text-purple"> [15g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [20g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat and once melted, add 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 125ml<span class="text-purple"> [190ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[250ml]</span> milk into the roux and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once thickened, add half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 30 secs or until melted – this is your cheese sauce


### Step 6

Add a thin layer of the bolognese filling to an oven-proof dish

Divide the remaining bolognese filling evenly between your tortillas and fold over into half-moon shapes

Place the folded tortillas into the oven-proof dish, top with the cheese sauce and remaining grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until golden – these are your pork & beef lasagne tacos


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl, add the salad and toss together – this is your balsamic salad

### Step 8

Leave the pork & beef lasagne tacos to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the pork & beef lasagne tacos with the balsamic salad to the side

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Enjoy!
