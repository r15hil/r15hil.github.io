## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Cut a piece<span class="text-danger"> </span>of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper (or two!)

Lay the halved Tenderstem in the middle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the Tenderstem to form a sealed parcel[s] and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut half your lemon[s] into thin slices and juice the remaining lemon into a bowl

Add your honey, 1/2 tsp of cornflour per person (save the rest for later!), half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon sauce


### Step 4

Cut your basa fillet[s] lengthways into 2 strips per person, then cut each strip in half

Add the remaining cornflour to a bowl along with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar, your five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together

Add the basa strips to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until all the basa is coated


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated basa strips along with the remaining soy sauce and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the basa is cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside (save the pan for later!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Stir the sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the cooked rice – this is your chilli rice


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the lemon sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce is thick and sticky

### Step 8

Serve the crispy basa with the chilli rice and roasted Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Drizzle the lemon sauce over the basa and garnish with the lemon slices and your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
