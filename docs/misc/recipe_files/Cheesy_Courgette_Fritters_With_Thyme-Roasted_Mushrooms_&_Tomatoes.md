Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 2

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the thyme sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and flat white mushrooms to a baking tray and top everything with your thyme leaves and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until softened – these are your thyme-roasted mushrooms & tomatoes

### Step 3

While the mushrooms and tomatoes are in the oven, top, tail then grate your courgette[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely

### Step 4

Add the grated courgette to the middle of a clean tea towel (or kitchen paper) and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can

### Step 5

Add the grated courgette to a bowl with most of the sliced spring onion (save a little for garnish!), your grated Italian hard cheese, cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Crack in 1/3 of your egg[s], season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your fritter mixture

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 2 per person and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (save the pan for the next step!) – these are your cheesy courgette fritters

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1634046959993-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Transfer the cheesy courgette fritters to an oven-proof dish and put them in the oven to keep warm

Return the fritter pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack the remaining eggs into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

### Step 8

Layer the cheesy courgette fritters on top of one another

Serve the thyme-roasted mushrooms & tomatoes and a fried egg to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
