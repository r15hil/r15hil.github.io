## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Chop your potato[e]s (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 450ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[750ml] </span>boiled water

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the grated garlic to the pot with the chopped tomato and fennel seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped potato to the pot with your Chinese rice wine and tomato stock

Stir it all together and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 22-25 min or until the potatoes are tender


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

On a separate board, chop your basa fillet[s] into large-bite sized pieces

Drain your king prawns


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, add the chopped basa to the pot with the drained king prawns, a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce to medium and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally, or until the fish and prawns are cooked through – this is your bouillabaisse-style basa & king prawn stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through, then spread with a knob of butter

Cut each buttered half into triangles – this is your buttery ciabatta

### Step 8

Serve the bouillabaisse-style basa & king prawn stew in bowls with the buttery ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley and a generous pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!
