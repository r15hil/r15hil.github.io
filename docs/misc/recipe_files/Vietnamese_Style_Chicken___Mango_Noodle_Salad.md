### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min, turning occasionally until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 2

Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water until fully submerged and stir for 10 sec until the noodles separate

Set aside to soak for 4 min, or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles, run them under cold water for 10 sec until slightly cooled, then set aside to drain further

### Step 4

Whilst the noodles are softening, combine the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar and soy sauce with 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span>[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil – this is your dressing

### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the outer lettuce leaves into rough, bite-sized pieces and shred the inner core

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them roughly, discarding the stalks

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 6

Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Chop the mango flesh into small bite-sized pieces, discarding the stone[s]

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2198.-step-7new-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the torn lettuce, drained noodles, chopped mango and most of the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a large bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your noodle salad

Transfer the crispy chicken to a clean board and shred apart into roughly bite-sized pieces using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

### Step 8

Serve the noodle salad topped with the crispy chicken

Garnish with the chopped herbs and remaining chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
