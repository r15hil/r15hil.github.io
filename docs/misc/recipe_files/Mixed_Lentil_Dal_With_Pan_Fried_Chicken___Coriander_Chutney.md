## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, dissolve your chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Drain your green lentils, then rinse them together with your red lentils


### Step 4

Add your curry powder to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils and coconut stock and cook for 15-20 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the lentils are tender – this is your mixed lentil dal


### Step 5

While the dal is cooking, heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Cut your chicken breast strips into smaller strips

Add the chicken strips and remaining sliced onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pan-fried chicken & onion


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Grind the chopped garlic and chopped ginger in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste

Add the chopped coriander, your rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the paste and mix it all together – this is your coriander chutney

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything very finely

### Step 8

Serve the mixed lentil dal topped with the pan-fried chicken & onion

Dollop the coriander chutney all over

Enjoy!
