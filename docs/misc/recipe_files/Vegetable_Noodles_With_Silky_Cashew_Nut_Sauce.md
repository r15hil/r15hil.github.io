## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your cashew nuts and cook for 3-4 min, or until they've darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, set them aside to cool slightly and save the pan for later


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Top, tail and finely dice your courgette[s]

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced carrot, diced courgette, sliced onion, sliced mushrooms and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt

Cook for 10-15 min or until everything is starting to caramelise


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 6

While the noodles soak, add 3/4 of the cooled cashew nuts (save the rest for garnish!) to a pestle & mortar and grind coarsely

Add your maple syrup, remaining chopped garlic, 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> of the reserved starchy noodle water and grind – this is your silky cashew nut sauce

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Use a food processor!


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks, then chop the remaining cashew nuts coarsely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Once the vegetables have caramelised, add the drained noodles with the silky cashew nut sauce, soy sauce and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) – these are your vegetable noodles with silky cashew nut sauce

### Step 8

Serve the vegetable noodles with silky cashew nut sauce

Garnish with the remaining chopped cashew nuts, reserved chopped coriander and the chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
