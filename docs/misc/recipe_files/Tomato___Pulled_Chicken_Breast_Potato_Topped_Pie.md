### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

While the potatoes are boiling, reboil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook for 3 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile dissolve your beef stock mix, tomato paste and Marmite in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [425ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your soy sauce – this is your rich tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the vegetables have softened, turn the heat up to high, then add the chopped garlic and your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, reduce the head to medium-high, then add your red wine vinegar and cook for 1 min further or until reduced slightly

Add the rich tomato stock and bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a generous knob of butter alternative and a splash of milk alternative

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your creamy mash

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Remove your bay leaf[ves] from the pan

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled chicken pie filling

### Step 7

Transfer the pulled chicken pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top evenly with the creamy mash

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your tomato & pulled chicken breast potato-topped pie

Reboil half a kettle

Once the pie is nearly ready, add your blanched peas to a colander and pour plenty of boiled water all over them until they're warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the tomato & pulled chicken breast potato-topped pie with the warmed peas to the side

Enjoy!
