Add your chicken breast portion[s] and red onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano over the chicken

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the onion wedges are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, rip your ciabatta[s] into rough bite-sized pieces

Add the torn ciabatta to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – these are your croutons

Use half!), Dijon mustard, natural yoghurt and half the grated Italian hard cheese (you’ll use the rest later!) with your white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and tear into rough bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once everything's cooked, separate the red onion wedges into petals

Add the torn lettuce, remaining grated Italian hard cheese, croutons, and red onion petals to a large mixing bowl

Add the yoghurt Caesar dressing and give everything a good mix until evenly coated in the dressing – this is your Caesar salad with yoghurt dressing
