## Ingredients

- 1 parsnip
- 2 plain naans
- 100g Greek-style yoghurt
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 15g tamarind paste
- 40g cranberry sauce
- 10g coriander
- 320g British skinless chicken thighs
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground turmeric

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the ground turmeric, smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the curry powder, half the Greek-style yogurt (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper to a large bowl and stir it all together – this is your tandoori marinade

Add the chicken thighs to the tandoori marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken


### Step 2

Peel the potatoes, then chop into small bite-sized cubes

Add the marinated chicken to one side of a baking tray


### Step 3

Add the potato cubes to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Sprinkle the remaining curry powder over the potato cubes, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and drizzle with vegetable oil – these are your spiced roast potatoes

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While everything is in the oven, grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Combine the cranberry sauce, tamarind paste and grated carrot in a bowl – this is your tamarind & cranberry slaw

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)


### Step 5

Peel the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of parsnip ribbons

Once the tandoori chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board and reserve the tray

Add the parsnip ribbons to the reserved tray and return it to the oven for 5 min further or until both the potatoes and parsnips are golden and crispy


### Step 6

Put the naans in the oven for 3 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Shred the tandoori chicken apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Spread the remaining Greek-style yoghurt over 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> naan<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then top with the tamarind & cranberry slaw and the pulled tandoori chicken

Sprinkle over the chopped coriander then top with the remaining naan<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your Indian chicken Christmas naanwiches

### Step 8

To serve, cut each Indian chicken Christmas naanwich into 4<span class="text-danger"> </span>and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and crispy parsnip ribbons

Serve with the spiced roast potatoes to the side

Let everyone dig in!
