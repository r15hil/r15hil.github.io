### Step 1

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Drain the tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24] </span>strips

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the tofu strips and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Once the tofu is crisp, transfer it to kitchen paper and set aside (reserve the pan for later!) – this is your crispy tofu

### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, peanut butter, chilli relish and soy sauce in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a jug

Stir it all together – this is your peanut stock

### Step 5

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons, discard the watery seeds

Add the cucumber ribbons to a large bowl and set aside

Add the rice vinegar to the cucumber ribbons and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your cucumber salad

### Step 6

Carefully wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-low heat

Add the peanut stock to the pan and cook for 2-4 min or until thickened slightly – this is your satay sauce

### Step 7

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, add the black sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame rice

### Step 8

Serve the crispy tofu over the sesame rice with the cucumber salad to the side

Pour the satay sauce all over the crispy tofu

Enjoy!
