## Ingredients

- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 1 parsnip
- 100g Brussels sprouts
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 4 white potatoes
- 400g canned green lentils
- 30ml soy sauce
- 2 tsp dried sage
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 1 apple
- 25g pistachio nuts
- 30g dried cranberries
- 2 brown onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and the portobello mushrooms

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min, then increase the heat to high, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for a further 5-7 min


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

While the mushrooms are cooking, peel and chop the potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are done, drain and leave them to steam dry, reserving the pot for later


### Step 3

While the potatoes are boiling, roughly chop the dried cranberries and pistachios

Drain and rinse the green lentils

Add the drained lentils, chopped cranberries, chopped pistachios, panko breadcrumbs, dried sage and half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to the onion and mushroom pan

Give everything a good mix up then mash until chunky – this is your pistachio nut roast mixture


### Step 4

Line a loaf tin (23 x13 x7cm) with non-stick baking paper and grease with vegetable oil

Add the pistachio nut roast mixture to the prepared tin (no loaf tin? Shape into a log instead!), pressing down into the corners and smoothing out the top with a spatula, then put the tin in the oven for 35-40 min or until golden and firm in the middle – this is your pistachio nut roast

Add a large drizzle of vegetable oil to 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and put in the oven to heat up


### Step 5

Top, tail, then halve the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>lengthways (no need to peel!) and trim the ends from the Brussels sprouts

Once the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of oil are hot, carefully add the halved parsnips and drained potatoes with a generous pinch of salt, then return to the oven for an initial 15 min

After 15 min add the Brussels sprouts to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and return to the oven for a further 10 min or until the potatoes are crispy – these are your roasted vegetables


### Step 6

Boil a kettle, then peel and slice the remaining brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat the reserved pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, then add the shredded red cabbage, grated apple, 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and half the sliced onion

Season with salt and pepper and cook, covered, for 20-25 min or until the water has evaporated – this is your braised red cabbage


### Step 7

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then stir in 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Add 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with the Henderson's Relish, remaining soy sauce and a generous grind of black pepper, then cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy

### Step 8

Gently turn the pistachio nut roast out onto a chopping board, let it cool slightly, then slice thickly

Serve the sliced pistachio nut roast with the roasted vegetables and braised red cabbage to the side

Drizzle over the onion gravy

Enjoy!
