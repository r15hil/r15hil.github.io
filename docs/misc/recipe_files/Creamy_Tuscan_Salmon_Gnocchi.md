### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the gnocchi and cook for 6-8 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the salmon fillets (skin-side down), season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min, turning once halfway

### Step 4

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Chop the sun-dried tomatoes roughly

### Step 5

Add the chopped garlic and chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the pan with a knob of butter and cook for 1 min until fragrant and all the butter has melted

### Step 6

Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium and add the crème fraîche with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato salmon

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the gnocchi has started to crisp, add the washed spinach to the pan and cook for 1-2 min until just starting to wilt – this is your spinach gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato salmon over the spinach gnocchi

Pour over any remaining creamy sun-dried tomato sauce, tear over the basil leaves and top with a few grinds of black pepper

Enjoy!
