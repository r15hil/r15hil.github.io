## Description

If you're familiar with spinach and ricotta lasagne, you'll be sure to love this kale and feta version, which delivers way more on the flavour front! An 'open-lasagne' is both quicker and easier than traditional, as it's all done on the hob - lazy lasagne! Served with a sweet baby plum tomato and basil leaf salad. You can't get much feta than that!

Meanwhile, bring a large&nbsp;pot of boiled water&nbsp;with a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, add the&nbsp;lasagne verdi sheets,&nbsp;one at a time,&nbsp;with a drizzle of olive oil between each one (this stops them sticking together)


Cook for 12 min or until they have softened and cooked

Stir 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span>&nbsp;milk gradually into the pan&nbsp;

### Step 5

Once wilted, crumble the feta into the&nbsp;kale&nbsp;

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the baby plum tomatoes in half&nbsp;


Strip the basil leaves from the stalks and chop the stalks finely, leaving the leaves whole &nbsp;


Add the chopped&nbsp;tomatoes and the basil leaves (keep the stalks for later) to a bowl with a splash of olive oil and a&nbsp;pinch of&nbsp;salt and pepper


Give everything a gentle mix up - this is your tomato &amp; basil salad


&nbsp;

### Step 7

Check the lasagne sheets are cooked


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot with a little&nbsp;starchy pasta water (this prevents them from sticking together)


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### Step 8

To serve, place a lasagne sheet on each plate and spoon over some of the&nbsp;kale &amp; feta sauce&nbsp;


Sprinkle some of the grated cheese and the chopped basil stalks over, then repeat with the remaining lasagne sheets


Serve the&nbsp;tomato &amp; basil salad to the side and enjoy!
