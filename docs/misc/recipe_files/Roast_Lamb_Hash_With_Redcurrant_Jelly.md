## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems then chop them as finely as possible, discard the stems


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes, carrot discs and chopped rosemary to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – this is your rosemary roast veg


### Step 3

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips  Wash your shredded spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 5

Once the onions have softened, increase the heat to high and add your lamb mince and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, combine your redcurrant jelly and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl with a pinch of salt


### Step 6

Once the lamb mince has browned, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once the rosemary roast veg are ready, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Transfer the rosemary roast veg to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your roast lamb hash

### Step 8

Serve the roast lamb hash on a plate and drizzle over the redcurrant jelly

Enjoy!
