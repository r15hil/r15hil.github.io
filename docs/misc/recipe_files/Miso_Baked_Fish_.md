## Ingredients

- 250g pak choi 
- 2 pangasius fillets
- 150g basmati rice
- 1 lemongrass
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 1 spring onion 
- 2 tbsp miso paste

## Instructions


### Step 1

Bash the lemongrass (to release the juices) and lay flat before slicing it down the middle


Add the rice, 375ml <span class="text-danger">(750ml)</span> water, lemongrass and a pinch of salt to a pot with a matching lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high


### Step 2

Once the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook covered for 10-15 min or until the water is absorbed, checking occasionally


Combine the miso paste and honey in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> hot water


Mix well into a smooth sauce


### Step 3

Pat the fish fillets dry with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel


Lay them on a baking tray


Tip: Use tin foil to avoid mess


Divide the paste between the fillets, spreading over evenly


### Step 4

Place the tray under the grill for approx. 10 min or until the miso paste has started to char


Tip: The charring will give the fish a smoky sweetness


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the pak choi in half lengthways through the root


Tip: Cutting through the root helps it stay together while cooking


Heat a dry, wide-based pan with matching lid on a high heat&nbsp;


When hot, add the pak choi (cut side down) and cook for 3 min or until charring (families might need to do this in batches)


### Step 6

Flip the pak choi (cut side up) once charred


Add approx. 2-4 tbsp hot water, cover and cook for a further 2-3 min or until tender


Season lightly with pepper


### Step 7

Once the rice is done, discard the lemongrass and fluff with a fork for serving


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> finely, discarding the root ends

### Step 8

Serve the fish with the pak choi and rice to the side


Tip: For fun presentation, transfer the rice into small bowls or cups, pat down firmly and turn out onto the serving plates


Scatter with spring onions and enjoy!
