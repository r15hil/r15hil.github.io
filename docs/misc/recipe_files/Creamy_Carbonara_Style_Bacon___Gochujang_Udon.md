## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat and boil a kettle

Chop your smoked streaky bacon roughly

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 3

Add your udon noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water then set aside to soak for 4-5 min

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Drain the soaked noodles

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic then trim and slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Once the bacon is starting to crisp, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 6

Add the drained noodles and your blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once warmed through, add your double cream, half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous grind of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy carbonara-style bacon & gochujang udon

### Step 8

Serve the creamy carbonara-style bacon & gochujang udon

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, your toasted sesame seeds and the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
