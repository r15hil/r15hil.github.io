## Ingredients

- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 1 tomato
- 32g tomato paste
- 250g portobello mushroom tortelloni
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 2 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 250g British beef mince
- 1 garlic clove
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Once hot, add the beef mince to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the beef is browning, dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Once starting to brown, add the sliced garlic and diced tomato to the beef and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Tip: Use a ladle to spoon the starchy water from the cooking pasta!


### Step 5

Add the dried basil and dried oregano to the beef with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Add the tomato paste, beef stock mix, soy sauce and 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your bolognese ragù


### Step 7

Add the drained tortelloni to the bolognese ragù and give everything a gentle mix up

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the bolognese ragù tortelloni topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
