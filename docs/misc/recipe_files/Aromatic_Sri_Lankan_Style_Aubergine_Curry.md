### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the aubergines (no prep needed!) to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until the aubergines are soft inside

### Step 2

While the aubergines are cooking, peel the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop very roughly

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop the ginger and garlic roughly

Separate the coriander leaves from their stalks and set them aside

### Step 3

Add the chopped onion, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), curry powder and coriander stalks (reserve the leaves for garnish!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your Sri Lankan-style curry paste

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

### Step 4

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the Sri Lankan-style curry paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Boil half a kettle

### Step 6

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then dissolve in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Add the red wine vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your coconut stock

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until a thick sauce remains

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1621937239063-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the aubergines are soft, transfer them to a clean board and carefully slice in half lengthways

Scoop out the soft aubergine flesh with a spoon and chop into bite-sized pieces, discard the skins

Add the chopped aubergine flesh to the pan, season with salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your Sri Lankan-style aubergine curry

Chop the reserved coriander leaves roughly

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style aubergine curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the crispy onions and chopped coriander leaves

Enjoy!
