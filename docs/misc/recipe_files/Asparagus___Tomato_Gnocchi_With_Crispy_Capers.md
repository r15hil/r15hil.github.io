## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 32g tomato paste
- 350g gnocchi
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 20g capers
- 120g asparagus
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Pat the capers dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add the capers to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until crispy, then season with a pinch of pepper

Once crispy, transfer the crispy capers to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 2

While the capers are cooking, peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

While the onion is softening, trim the woody ends off the asparagus

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Chop the asparagus tips away from the stalks and set them aside, then finely chop the asparagus stalks


### Step 5

Boil a full kettle

Once the onion and garlic has slightly softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have completely softened

Add the tomato paste to the pan with the chopped asparagus stalks and cook for 1 min


### Step 6

Add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water to the pan with the vegetable stock mix and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your asparagus & tomato sauce


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the gnocchi and trimmed asparagus tips to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi and asparagus for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot and once done, drain both, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water

Add the cooked gnocchi and asparagus tips to the sauce and mix it all together, add a little starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry – this is your asparagus & tomato gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the asparagus & tomato gnocchi in bowls topped with the crispy capers

Drizzle over a little olive oil and enjoy!
