### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half, then trim the woody ends off your asparagus

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

### Step 2

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml] <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> </span>boiled water – this is your stock

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, transfer the pine nuts to a bowl and reserve the pan

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 5

Once slightly softened, add the halved tomatoes and chopped garlic and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have softened

Once softened, add your orzo and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains

### Step 6

Add the stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking

### Step 7

When the orzo has 7 min left, heat a separate, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the trimmed asparagus and cook for an initial 3 min, then sprinkle over 2/3 of the grated cheese and cook for a further 3 min or until the cheese has melted and begun to crisp up on the bottom – this is your cheesy asparagus

Once the orzo is cooked, stir through your soft cheese and the remaining grated cheese and cook for a final 2-3 min – this is your creamy tomato orzo

### Step 8

Serve the creamy tomato orzo in a bowl with the cheesy asparagus to the side (crispy side up)

Top with the toasted pine nuts and a generous grind of black pepper
