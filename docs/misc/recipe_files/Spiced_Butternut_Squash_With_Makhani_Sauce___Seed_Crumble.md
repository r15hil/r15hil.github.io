### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel your butternut squash and cut in half using a sharp knife,

Tip: Drizzle the knife with a little vegetable oil for easier chopping

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard, then slice, lengthways, into wedges

### Step 2

Add the butternut squash wedges to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground cumin, ground turmeric, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the butternut squash is cooked through and tender – these are your spiced butternut squash wedges

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nut & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a small bowl and set aside

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 4

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the crushed cardamom pods, dried lime leaves, ginger & garlic paste, garam masala and curry powder and cook for 30 secs

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly thickened

Once slightly thickened, add the vegetable stock and creamy single soy to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your makhani sauce

### Step 8

Serve the spiced butternut squash wedges over the makhani sauce and warmed roti to the side

Sprinkle over the seed crumble

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods and lime leaves!

Enjoy!
