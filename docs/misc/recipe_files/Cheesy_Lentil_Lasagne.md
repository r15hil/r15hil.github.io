## Ingredients

- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Lasagne sheets (120g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Green lentils (185g)
- Garlic clove
- Soft cheese (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Once the onion has started to soften, add the drained green lentils, your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock mix to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until starting to thicken to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your lentil lasagne mix


### Step 4

Dissolve your soft cheese in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Melt 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a medium-sized pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Gradually whisk in the creamy stock, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your white sauce


### Step 6

Layer some of the lentil lasagne mix over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets

Cover with the white sauce, then top with the grated cheese

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish


### Step 7

Add the dish to a baking tray, cover with tin foil and cook in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the pasta is cooked

Remove the tin foil and return the dish to the oven for a further 10 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – this is your cheesy lentil lasagne

### Step 8

Leave the cheesy lentil lasagne to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!
