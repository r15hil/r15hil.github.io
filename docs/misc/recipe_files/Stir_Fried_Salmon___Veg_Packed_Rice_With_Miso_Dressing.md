## Ingredients

- 80g fine green beans
- 17g white miso paste
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 130g brown rice
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 100g salmon flakes
- 80g spinach
- 15g pumpkin seeds
- 80g mangetout
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, transfer the toasted seeds to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Trim, then chop the green beans in half

Slice the mangetout in half widthways

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Combine the miso paste, toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar in a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of water and a pinch of sugar – this is your miso dressing


### Step 5

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the halved green beans and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the beans have started to soften, add the mangetout with the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the greens are tender with a slight bite

Add in the spinach and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Add the salmon flakes to the pan along with the brown rice and cook for 1-2 min or until everything is warmed through – this is your stir-fried salmon & veg-packed rice

### Step 8

Serve the stir-fried salmon & veg-packed rice and drizzle the miso dressing all over

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!
