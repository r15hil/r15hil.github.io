## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain your tofu, pat it dry with kitchen paper and crumble it into bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the crumbled tofu with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Add a little more vegetable oil if the pan is looking dry

Add your wholewheat noodles and the Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat for 4-5 min or until cooked with a bite


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

Once the crumbled tofu is golden, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Combine your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), red chilli relish and the juice of your lime[s] in a bowl – this is your spicy noodle sauce


### Step 6

Once cooked, drain the wholewheat noodles and Tenderstem broccoli and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!


### Step 7

Stir the drained wholewheat noodles and Tenderstem broccoli through the crumbled tofu with a pinch of salt

Add your spicy noodle sauce with a splash of the reserved noodle water and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy veggie noodles

Tip: Add a little more of the reserved noodle water if it's looking dry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy veggie noodles and drizzle your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) all over the top

Garnish with the roasted peanuts and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
