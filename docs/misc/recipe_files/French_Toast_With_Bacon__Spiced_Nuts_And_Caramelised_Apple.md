## Ingredients

- Ground cinnamon (0.5tsp) x2
- Walnuts (25g)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Apple x2
- Smoked streaky bacon (90g)
- British free range egg
- Pecan nuts (25g)
- Honey (25g) x2
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (45g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your smoked streaky bacon to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 4 min


### Step 2

Whilst the bacon is cooking, crack your egg[s] into a large bowl and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk, half your ground cinnamon (save the rest for later!) and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Whisk everything together until smooth – this is your French toast mix


### Step 3

Slice your apple[s] finely (skin on), discarding the core


### Step 4

After an initial 4 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your pecan nuts and walnuts to the other side of the tray[s]

Drizzle the nuts with half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and sprinkle with the remaining ground cinnamon, give everything a good mix up and return the tray[s] to the oven for 8-11 min or until the bacon is golden and crispy and the nuts have caramelised

Tip: Watch the nuts like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dip your brioche halves into the French toast mix until it's been absorbed by the bread

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the soaked brioche and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp – this is your French toast

Tip: You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the sliced apple with 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 1/2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and caramelised

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 7

Once the nuts have caramelised, transfer to a chopping board and chop them roughly (careful they may be hot!)  – this is your spiced nuts

### Step 8

Serve the French toast topped with a dollop of crème fraîche, the spiced nuts and crispy bacon

Serve the caramelised apple to the side and drizzle the remaining honey all over

Enjoy!
