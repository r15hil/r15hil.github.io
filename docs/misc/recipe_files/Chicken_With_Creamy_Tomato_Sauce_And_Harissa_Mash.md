### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Chop your potato[es] and carrot[s] (no need to peel!) into rough bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Add the chopped potato and carrot to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 4

Reboil half a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, then add your soft cheese and mix well – this is your creamy chicken stock

### Step 5

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the chicken is golden, add the halved cherry tomatoes and the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

Add the creamy chicken stock to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, return the drained potato & carrot to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk, your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your harissa mash

Tip: Don't worry if your carrot doesn't get completely smooth, it will add some texture to your mash!

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, wash your spinach, then add it to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until it has wilted slightly – this is your creamy tomato sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cooked chicken with the harissa mash and drizzle over the creamy tomato sauce

Enjoy!
