### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, slice down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem[s] finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Add your basmati rice, 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water, the outer lemongrass layers and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

Boil a kettle

### Step 5

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once fragrant, add the sliced pepper, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped lemongrass inner stem and cook for 4-5 min further

### Step 6

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the coconut stock, halved green beans and a pinch of salt and cook for 7-9 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your mild Cambodian-style chicken samla curry

Remove the lemongrass outer layers from the rice and discard

### Step 8

Serve the mild Cambodian-style chicken samla curry with the lemongrass rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
