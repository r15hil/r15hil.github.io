## Ingredients

- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Mediterranean style seasoning (3g)
- Red pepper
- Ciabatta x2
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Tomato
- White potato x3
- Shallot
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)


### Step 2

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the pepper half[ves] to the side of the tray and top with a small drizzle of olive oil

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-15 min or until the pepper is slightly softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Crumble your Greek cheese into small, bite-sized pieces

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!), then tear into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the crumbled Greek cheese to a large bowl with the torn mozzarella and sliced shallot

Add your Mediterranean seasoning with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Greek cheese toastie mix


### Step 5

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Divide the Greek cheese toastie mix evenly between the ciabatta base[s]

Tip: Use your hands to press the cheese mixture onto the ciabatta base[s]


### Step 6

After an initial 10-15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully remove the cooked pepper half[ves]

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a final 10-15 min or until the fries are crispy and golden brown

Top each cheesy ciabatta base[s] with a cooked pepper half, hollow side down

Place a ciabatta lid on top – this is your Greek cheese ciabatta[s]


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the Greek cheese ciabatta[s] and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 4-5 min per side, checking occasionally or until the ciabatta is golden and the cheese has melted – this is your Greek grilled cheese & pepper toastie

### Step 8

Cut the Greek grilled cheese & pepper toastie in half and serve with the fries and salad to the side

Top the salad with the tomato wedges, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Serve with a dollop of mayo and a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!
