## Description

This classic dish is said to have been invented in 1891 when a French chef entered it into a Russian cooking contest. Needless to say he won, and the rest is history. Our diced pork mushroom version is deliciously indulgent yet surprisingly easy to make. Stroga-nom! (Gluten-free, suitable for coeliacs).
