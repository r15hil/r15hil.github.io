### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the fries to the tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crispy

### Step 2

While the fries are in the oven, slice your basa fillet[s] into quarters

Add the basa pieces, soy sauce and ground smoked paprika to a bowl and give everything a good mix up, then set aside

Add your cornflour, dried oregano and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to a shallow plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix well – this is your herby mixture

Tip: For a spicier burger, go heavy on the black pepper!

### Step 3

Remove the basa pieces from the bowl and firmly press each one into the herby mixture, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – these are your coated basa goujons

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa goujons and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy fried basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Dice your tomato[es] finely

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1627030385415-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with your mayo, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your garlic mayo

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing

### Step 8

Spread the garlic mayo on your warmed brioche base, then pile up the shredded lettuce and crispy fried basa, topping with your warmed brioche lid

Serve the fries, diced tomato and any remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the salad dressing over the tomato and lettuce

Enjoy!
