## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5-6 min or until browned and crisped, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the mince is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Once the pork mince has browned, add the sliced pepper with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper has started to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your rice vinegar, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and red chilli relish to a bowl

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky chilli sauce


### Step 6

Once the pepper has started to soften, add your ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the sticky chilli sauce and cook for 2 min or until everything is coated and sticky and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky chilli pork stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the sticky chilli pork stir-fry over the basmati rice

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
