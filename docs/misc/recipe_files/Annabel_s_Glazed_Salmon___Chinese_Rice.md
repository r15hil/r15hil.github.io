### Step 6

Meanwhile, line a baking tray with tin foil and add the salmon and marinade (scrunch up the edges of tin foil to stop the marinade escaping!)

Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to the pan with the softened onion

Give everything a good old mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the rice is beginning to crisp slightly &ndash; this is your Chinese rice

### Step 8

Serve the&nbsp;glazed salmon&nbsp;over the Chinese rice


Drizzle over any remaining marinade


Garnish with the black sesame seeds&nbsp;


Enjoy!
