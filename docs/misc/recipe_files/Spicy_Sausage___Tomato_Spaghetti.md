## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Remove your sausage meat from the skins and discard the skins

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once hot, add the sausage meat with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Whilst the sausage meat is cooking, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the wholewheat spaghetti and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 4

Meanwhile, reboil a full kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic and halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it until wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool enough to handle, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 6

Once the sausage meat is cooked through, add the tomato stock to the pan with the wilted spinach and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Stir through your soft cheese and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until everything is combined – this is your spicy sausage & tomato sauce

### Step 8

Serve the spicy sausage & tomato sauce over the cooked spaghetti

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
