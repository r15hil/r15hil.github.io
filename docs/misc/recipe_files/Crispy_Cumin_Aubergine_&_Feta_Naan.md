### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then cut into 1 inch rounds

Slice your cucumber finely

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 2

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

### Step 3

Add the pepper strips to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and set aside

### Step 4

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate and season with salt and pepper

Combine your ground cumin with your panko breadcrumbs on a separate plate – these are your cumin breadcrumbs

### Step 5

Coat the aubergine rounds in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the beaten egg and finally press into the cumin breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over

Add the coated aubergine rounds to the other side of the baking tray[s] and then put in the oven for 20-25 min or until the aubergine is crisp, golden and cooked through – this is your crispy cumin aubergine & roasted pepper

### Step 6

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander & parsley finely, including the stalks

When the aubergine and pepper are almost ready, add your naan[s] to a separate baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle with a little cold water

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3 min or until warmed through

### Step 7

Combine the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your tomato paste, the pickling liquid from the sliced cucumber and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your chilli sauce

### Step 8

To serve, place a warmed naan on a plate and spread half your natural yoghurt and half the chilli sauce over the top

Layer on the crispy cumin aubergine & roasted pepper with the quick-pickled cucumber and chopped herbs, then crumble over your feta

Drizzle the remaining yoghurt and chilli sauce all over and sprinkle with your crispy onions and enjoy!
