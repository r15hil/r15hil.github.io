- Gem lettuce
- Cheese flavour slices (2pcs)
- Tomato
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Gluten free brioche buns (2pcs)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3
- Rosemary (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems, then sprinkle the chopped rosemary all over the chips and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your rosemary chips


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Heat a pot with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to break down

Whilst the tomatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic and tomato paste to the pot and cook for 30 secs further

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water with your balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 5-6 min or until the tomatoes have broken down and it's reduced to a ketchup-like consistency – this is your tomato relish


### Step 4

Add your meat-free burger patties to one side of a baking paper-lined tray, then put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 5

Whilst everything is in the oven, wash your lettuce then pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove 2 outer leaves per person from the lettuce and chop the inner core[s] into quarters

Peel and slice your shallot[s] into rounds


### Step 6

Once the patties have had 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and top them with your cheese flavour slices – these are your cheezy meat-free patties


### Step 7

Slice your gluten free brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese flavour slices have melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 8

Assemble your burgers by topping the warmed brioche base with a dollop of tomato relish, 2 lettuce leaves, a cheezy meat-free patty, some shallot rounds and the warmed brioche lid – this is your ultimate veggie cheezeburger

Serve the ultimate veggie cheezeburger with the rosemary chips, lettuce quarters and any remaining tomato relish to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
