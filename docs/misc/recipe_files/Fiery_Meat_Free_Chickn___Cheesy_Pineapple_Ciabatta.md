## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Gem lettuce
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ciabatta x2
- Ground allspice (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- White potato x3
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Pineapple slices (220g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Separate 2 leaves per person from your lettuce

Chop the remaining lettuce<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters lengthways

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 3

After the chips have had 20 min, remove your pineapple from the can (save the juice for later!) and add to a separate baking tray

Top the pineapple slices with your grated cheddar cheese

Add your ciabatta[s] to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until the cheese is melted

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown


### Step 5

Combine your mayo with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>reserved pineapple juice and season with a pinch of pepper – this is your pineapple mayo

Tip: Keep the remaining pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!


### Step 6

Once the meat-free chick'n is starting to brown, add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice and soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2 min


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the meat-free chick'n to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks (this technique is known as ‘pulling’) then return to the pan – this is your shredded fiery meat-free chick'n

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half

### Step 8

Assemble the ciabatta with a lettuce leaf, a cheesy pineapple slice, the shredded fiery meat-free chick'n, another lettuce leaf, another cheesy pineapple slice and finally a dollop of pineapple mayo

Serve with the chips and lettuce wedges to the side

Enjoy!
