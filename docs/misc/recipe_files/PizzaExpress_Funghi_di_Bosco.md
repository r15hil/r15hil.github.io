## Ingredients

- 400g pizza dough
- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 4 tbsp canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 5g rosemary
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 5g parsley
- 125g mozzarella
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Cut the PizzaExpress pizza dough in half

Shape the dough into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> balls and set aside for 15 min


### Step 2

Dice the mozzarella into small bite-sized pieces and add to some kitchen paper

Press down on the diced mozzarella with another piece of kitchen paper to squeeze out as much liquid as you can


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the chopped garlic with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic oil

Slice the portobello mushrooms

Strip the rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 4

Once the dough balls have rested for 15 min, press your palm into the middle of a dough ball to flatten it until it is twice as wide

Turn the dough over and repeat a few times, until approx. 24cm in diameter (use a rolling pin to help you!)

Repeat with the other dough ball<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your pizza bases

Transfer the pizza bases to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or 2!)


### Step 5

Spread 2 tbsp finely chopped tomatoes over each pizza base (save the rest for another recipe!)

Season with a pinch of salt

Top with the sliced mushrooms, diced mozzarella and chopped rosemary

Drizzle over the garlic oil and season with a double pinch of black pepper


### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 9-19 min or until the pizza bases are golden and crisp and the mozzarella has melted

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may have to do this in batches!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel the Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings – this is your shaved cheese

### Step 8

Once the pizzas are ready, top them with the chopped parsley and shaved cheese – these are your funghi di bosco pizzas

Serve the funghi di bosco pizza

Enjoy!
