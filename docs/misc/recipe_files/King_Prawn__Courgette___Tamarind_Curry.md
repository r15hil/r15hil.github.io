## Description

This South-East Asian dish is packed with flavour and texture. The tamarind complements the sweetness of the coconut brilliantly; our mild korma spice blend adds layers of flavour, while the crunch of the courgette works perfectly with the juicy king prawns! (Gluten and dairy-free, suitable for coeliacs).
