## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half, then add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until slightly charred – these are your roasted tomatoes

Once done, remove the tray[s] from the oven, transfer the roasted tomatoes to a plate and reserve the tray[s] for later


### Step 2

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml<span class="text-purple"> [975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Once the shallot has started to soften, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the chopped garlic, dried basil and tomato paste and cook for 2 min further or until fragrant

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, chop your basil finely (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Combine half the chopped basil (you'll use the rest later!) with the crème fraîche – this is your basil crème fraîche


### Step 5

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Chop the drained mozzarella into small cubes

Combine the cubed mozzarella with your sun-dried tomato paste, remaining chopped basil, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your basil mozzarella


### Step 6

Line the reserved baking tray[s] with baking paper, then slice your ciabatta[s] into 4 thin slices per person, and add to the tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle a very thin layer of your grated Italian hard cheese onto the baking tray[s] into 1 heart shape per person (save the rest for later!), then put the tray[s] in the oven for 8 min or until the ciabatta is lightly toasted and the cheese has melted – these are your ciabatta crostinis and heart crisps

Tip: Keep an eye on the heart crisps to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Once the risotto is ready, stir through the roasted tomatoes and remaining grated Italian hard cheese – this is your roasted tomato risotto

Top the ciabatta crostinis with the basil mozzarella – these are your mozzarella crostinis

### Step 8

Serve the roasted tomato risotto topped with the basil crème fraîche, a heart crisp, the reserved basil leaves and the salad

Serve the mozzarella crostinis to the side

Enjoy!
