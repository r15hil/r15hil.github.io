## Ingredients

- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Tortiglioni (200g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Coriander (10g)
- Coriander (5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Drain your sweetcorn

Once the pan is hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a small pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char

Once done, transfer to a bowl and set aside for later (reserve the pan!)


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water, then return the drained tortiglioni to the pot

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 4

While the tortiglioni is cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 5

Add the softened shallot & garlic and half the charred corn (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor

Add the vegetable stock, your soft cheese, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous grind of black pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your creamy corn


### Step 6

Crumble your Greek cheese into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the creamy corn and remaining charred corn to the drained tortiglioni

Add the crumbled Greek cheese and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your Mexican-style creamy corn & Greek cheese tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash of reserved starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style creamy corn & Greek cheese tortiglioni in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Season with a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
