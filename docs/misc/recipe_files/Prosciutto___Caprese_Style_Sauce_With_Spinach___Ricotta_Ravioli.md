- Basil (10g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your prosciutto slices to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your prosciutto slices every 30 secs to prevent them from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!


### Step 3

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks


### Step 4

Add your spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spinach & ricotta ravioli


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and half the chopped basil (save the rest for later!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and sugar and a grind of black pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has started to thicken


### Step 6

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Chop the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Add the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli and chopped mozzarella to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your Caprese-style sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

### Step 8

Serve the Caprese-style sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli and top with the crispy prosciutto and remaining chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
