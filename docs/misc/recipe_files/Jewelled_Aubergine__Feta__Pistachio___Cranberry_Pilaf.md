### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min

### Step 3

Add your ground cumin, ground turmeric and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 4

Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan along with your soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min further or until the spinach is starting to wilt and the aubergine is tender

### Step 7

Add the cooked rice to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 30 secs further or until the rice is completely coated in all the spices – this is your jewelled aubergine & cranberry pilaf

### Step 8

Set the jewelled aubergine & cranberry pilaf in the centre of the table

Garnish with your pistachio nuts and crumble over your feta

Enjoy!
