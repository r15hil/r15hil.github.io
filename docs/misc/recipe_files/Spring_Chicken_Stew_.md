## Description

You may think stew is just for winter, but this creamy chicken dish has been updated for spring. Flavoured with smoky bacon, garlic, sweet sugar snap peas and creme fraiche - each element is in tune with spring. By coating the chicken here in cornflour before pan-frying it, you create a sauce that is perfectly thickened within the allotted time.
