### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and grate your garlic

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the grated garlic, dried oregano and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base

### Step 3

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut your cucumber into batons

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a generous drizzle of olive oil in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

### Step 4

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato base evenly over your pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizza doesn't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!

### Step 5

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your margherita pizza

### Step 6

Whilst the pizza is cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil over a medium heat for 1-2 min or until very hot

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small heatproof bowl with a pinch of salt

Carefully pour the heated oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your chilli oil

### Step 7

Combine your salad and cucumber batons in a bowl with the balsamic dressing

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Set aside half of the cucumber batons for serving!</span>

Give everything a good mix up – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the margherita pizza and drizzle over the chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve with the salad to the side

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave off the chilli oil and serve the reserved cucumber batons to the side!</span>

Enjoy!
