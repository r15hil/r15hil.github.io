## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, lets get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite


### Step 3

While the noodles are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your pork mince with your ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Be careful – the garlic and ginger will sizzle from the heat of the oil!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your mangetout in half roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed)

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Once the noodles are almost cooked, add the halved mangetout and cook for 1 min or until just cooked with a bite

Once cooked, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and keep to one side


### Step 5

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly


### Step 6

Once the pork mince has browned, add your soy sauce, red chilli relish and the juice of your lime[s] and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 4 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Add the grated carrot, drained noodles and mangetout to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your sweet chilli pork wholewheat noodles

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry

Crush your roasted peanuts in the bag with a rolling pin and sprinkle them over

### Step 8

Serve your sweet chilli pork wholewheat noodles and garnish with the chopped spring onion, crushed peanuts and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
