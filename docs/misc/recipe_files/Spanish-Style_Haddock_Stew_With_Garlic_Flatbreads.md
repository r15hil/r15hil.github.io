### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-7 min or until softened and starting to caramelise

### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper and cook for 3-5 min or until tender

Once tender, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), tomato paste, ground cumin, ground coriander and ground smoked paprika and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>cold water and cook for 10-15 min

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the remaining chopped garlic with most the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) in a small bowl

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic & parsley oil

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1600.-step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add your plain tortillas to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle the garlic & parsley oil over the tortillas

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5 min or until the tortillas are crispy – these are your garlic & parsley flatbreads

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the pan and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your Spanish-style haddock stew

### Step 8

Chop the garlic & parsley flatbreads into quarters

Serve the Spanish-style haddock stew in a bowl

Sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and the chopped garlic & parsley flatbreads to the side

Enjoy!
