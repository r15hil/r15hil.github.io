## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 1 toasted sesame seed sachet (5g)
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 1 soy sauce sachet (30ml)
- 1 tomato ketchup sachet (30ml)
- 1 honey pot (25g)
- 130g brown rice
- 50g baby kale
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain into a sieve and set aside, reserving the pot for later


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, add the diced chicken thigh, five-spice and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown slightly, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is nearly cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 5

Combine the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato ketchup, soy sauce and honey in a bowl – this is your soy and honey sauce


### Step 6

Remove the lid from the pan and add the soy and honey sauce

Increase the heat to medium and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and a sticky sauce has formed, then remove from the heat – this is your sticky chicken


### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat

Rinse the baby kale

Add the drained rice with the washed kale and cook for 1 min or until the kale is mixed through and beginning to wilt

Remove the pot from the heat and season with a pinch of salt – this is your brown rice & kale

### Step 8

Serve the sticky chicken over the brown rice & kale

Sprinkle over the sesame seeds

Enjoy!
