## Description

Offering a little welcome heat from the chipotle, our family-pleasing veggie chilli is packed with two types of beans, red pepper and rich smoky flavour. What's more, it's easy to make, and deliciously satisfying thanks to fluffy rice and cool yoghurt on the side. Yee-haw! (Gluten-free, suitable for coeliacs).

## Ingredients

- 40g mature cheddar 
- 1 can of cannellini beans
- 1 can of kidney beans
- 80g natural yoghurt 
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 130g basmati rice
- 1 chipotle paste sachet (20g)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat 


Once hot, add the sliced pepper with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until it's softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, tomato paste, chipotle paste and a generous pinch of sugar in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your smoky stock


Drain and rinse the cannellini beans and kidney beans


### Step 5

Once the peppers have softened, add the smoked paprika and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min


Stir the drained cannellini beans and kidney beans into the pan and cook for 1 min or until they are coated in the spices 


Add your smoky stock with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook the beans for 5-7 min or until everything has reduced to a chilli-like consistency


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese


Trim, then slice the spring onions finely


### Step 7

Once reduced, mash the beans gently, breaking some of them up and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the beans have thickened – this is your two-bean chilli 


Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the two-bean chilli<span class="text-highlight"> over the rice</span>


Garnish with the grated cheddar, chopped spring onion and a dollop of natural yoghurt


Enjoy!
