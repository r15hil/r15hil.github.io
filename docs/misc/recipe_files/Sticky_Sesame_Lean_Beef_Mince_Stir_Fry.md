## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened slightly


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Once the pepper has softened, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 5

Return the pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once very hot, add your lean beef mince and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Once the lean beef has browned, add your cornflour, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and maple syrup, then return the softened pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until sticky and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the lean beef is sticky, remove the pan from the heat, sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky sesame lean beef mince stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the sticky sesame lean beef mince stir-fry over the cooked rice

Enjoy!
