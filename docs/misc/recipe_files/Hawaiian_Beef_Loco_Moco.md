## Ingredients

- 1 Henderson's Relish sachet (15ml)
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 250g British beef mince
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 1/2 Knorr beef stock cube
- 130g basmati rice
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 soy sauce sachet (8ml)
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Peel and grate 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> brown onion into a large bowl

Slice the remaining onion finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and beginning to brown


### Step 2

Whilst the onion is cooking, add the beef mince and panko breadcrumbs to the bowl with the grated onion

Season with a generous pinch of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up until well combined, then shape into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>patties


### Step 3

Add the patties to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan with a very generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve half<span class="text-danger"> [all]</span> the Knorr beef stock cube in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and add the Henderson's Relish and soy sauce

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>flour and the chopped garlic to the pan with the mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your gravy


### Step 7

Once everything is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Cook, covered for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

### Step 8

Serve the patties over the cooked rice and pour the gravy all over

Top with a fried egg and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
