Once the grains are coated, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your jeera rice

Add the tomato stock and then cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your meat-free chick'n jalfrezi

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free chick'n jalfrezi over the jeera rice
