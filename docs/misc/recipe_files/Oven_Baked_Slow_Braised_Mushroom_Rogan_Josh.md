## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the wedged tomato and onion and with your Fable pulled mushrooms


### Step 4

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 5

Add the crushed garlic and cardamom pods to the dish with your ground turmeric, ground coriander, curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 6

Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and add your chopped tomatoes, a pinch of sugar and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[590ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 30-35 min or until the the sauce has thickened and everything's cooked through – this is your one-pot slow-braised mushroom rogan josh


### Step 7

Combine your mayo and mint sauce in a bowl – this is your minty mayo

Once the curry is almost done, add your naan[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot slow-braised mushroom rogan josh and drizzle over the minty mayo

Serve the warmed naans to the side

Tip: Watch out for the cardamom pods and discard them!
