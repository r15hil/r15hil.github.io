### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your sliced prosciutto to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your prosciutto slices every 30 secs to prevent them from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms into the pan

Add the sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 5

Add your spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spinach & ricotta ravioli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once the mushrooms are beginning to soften, add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water to the pan with a large knob of butter and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good stir until combined and the sauce has thickened

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1664293020468-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your mushroom sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Tip: Add a little more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli topped with the crispy prosciutto

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
