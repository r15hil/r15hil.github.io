## Instructions


### Step 1

Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Once done, simply dig in!


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and roughly chop


### Step 3

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Add a little butter to each mug and pop in the microwave for 1 min or until melted


### Step 5

Crack your egg[s] into a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and whisk until fully combined

Add your chopped tomatoes, wilted spinach and half your grated cheese (save the rest for later!) and stir it all together – this is your omelette mix

Divide your omelette mix evenly between the mugs


### Step 6

Put your mug[s] in the microwave for an initial 2-3 min and then stir

Cook for another 2-3 min and stir

Top with the remaining grated cheese and microwave for 1-2 min or until the egg is cooked to your liking and the cheese has started to melt – this is your cheddar, tomato & spinach mug-lette

Allow to stand for 1 min


### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, spread with butter

### Step 8

To serve, garnish your cheddar, tomato & spinach mug-lette with a generous grind of pepper

Cut the buttered ciabatta in half diagonally and serve to the side

Time to start your day!
