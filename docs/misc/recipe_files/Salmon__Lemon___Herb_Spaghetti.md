## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your salmon fillet[s] with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until starting to colour


### Step 3

Wash your spinach and add it to a pot of boiled water with your quick cook spaghetti and a large pinch of salt, then bring to a boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spaghetti and spinach are cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti & spinach reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once the salmon is starting to colour, add your roasted garlic paste and the juice of your lemon[s] (watch out for any pips!) and cook for 3-4 min further on each side or until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Once the salmon is cooked through, peel off and discard the skin and then flake the cooked salmon into bite-sized pieces in the pan

Chop your chives roughly


### Step 7

Add the vegetable stock and clotted cream to the flaked salmon and gently stir it all together

Add the drained spaghetti & spinach and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce

Season with a generous pinch of black pepper – this is your salmon & lemon spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

To serve, top the salmon & lemon spaghetti with the chopped chives – this is your salmon, lemon & herb spaghetti

Garnish with your grated Italian hard cheese and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
