### Step 1

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced pepper, chopped garlic and half your diced chorizo (save the rest for later!) to the pan, then cook for 3-4 min or until the peppers are starting to soften

### Step 3

Once softened, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if the pan looks a little dry

### Step 4

Stir your chicken stock mix and white long grain rice into the pan

Add 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice is not fully cooked or the mixture is looking a little dry

### Step 5

Drain your sweetcorn

### Step 6

Once the rice is nearly cooked, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped

Reduce the heat to medium-low, crack your egg[s] into the same pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the drained sweetcorn, chopped coriander, the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your Spanish-style red rice

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Spanish-style red rice with the chorizo and fried egg on top and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
