Once the chorizo has had its 5 min, add the balsamic vinegar, honey and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water to the pan and cook for a further 5 min or until everything is coated in a sticky and caramelised balsamic glaze - this is your balsamic chorizo

Once done, transfer the cooked peppers to a chopping board and carefuly cut them into strips
