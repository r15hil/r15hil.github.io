## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and cut your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice


### Step 2

Add the chopped vegetables to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and lightly browned – this is your roasted veg

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil, then once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the garlic to a food processor and set aside, reserve the pot

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your green lentils and chickpeas


### Step 4

Add the green lentils and 1/3 of the chickpeas (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot with the chopped coriander, cumin seeds, panko breadcrumbs and half of your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!)

Add the juice of half your lemon[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then mash until smooth

Tip: If the mixture is a little dry, try adding a small splash of water


### Step 5

Line a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil

Divide the mixture into 3 per person and form into small sausage shapes – these are your spiced koftas

Add the spiced koftas to the baking tray[s] and drizzle them with olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the over for 15 min or until beginning to brown and crisp


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your tahini, vegetable stock mix, half of the roasted pepper (save the rest for later!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water to the food processor and blitz until smooth

Add the remaining chickpeas, the juice of the remaining lemon and remaining ground smoked paprika with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz again until smooth and creamy – this is your homemade hummus

Tip: Add a splash more cold water if your hummus is looking a little dry!


### Step 7

Once the koftas are beginning to crisp, add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and return to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Once done, chop the warmed pitta[s] into triangles

### Step 8

Serve the spiced koftas on top of the homemade hummus with roasted veg and warmed pitta triangles to the side

Enjoy!
