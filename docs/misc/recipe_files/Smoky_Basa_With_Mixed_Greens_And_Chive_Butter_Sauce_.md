### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and place on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Once the potatoes have had 7 min, add the halved green beans and Tenderstem broccoli to the pot (check the potatoes are nearly cooked first!) and cook, covered for 4-8 min further or until both are fork-tender

Drain everything and set aside until serving – this is your mixed greens & potatoes

Serve the smoky basa with the mixed greens & potatoes to the side

Spoon the chive butter sauce over the fish

Enjoy!
