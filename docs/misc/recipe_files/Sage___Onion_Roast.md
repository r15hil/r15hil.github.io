## Ingredients

- 2 apples
- 1 egg
- 100g parsnips
- 400g potatoes
- 1 ciabatta roll
- 10g fresh sage
- 100g Brussels sprouts
- 200g carrots
- 1 onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to&nbsp;240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Peel and cut the parsnip<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>, carrot<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> and potatoes (with skins on) into 3 cm chunks


Place the vegetables on a baking tray, coat with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> (4 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil, season generously with salt and place in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s) </span>


Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil on a medium-high heat


When hot, add the onion, a pinch of salt


Cook for 4 min until softened, stirring frequently


### Step 3

Meanwhile, tear the ciabatta into bite-size pieces, chop the sage finely (stalks too) and combine in a large mixing bowl


Add 50ml<span class="text-danger"> (100ml)</span>&nbsp;milk to the onion pan and warm for 1 min, then pour it over the bread and wipe the pan clean for step 7


Season the mixture generously with salt and pepper, mix well, then cover with cling film until step 7&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel the apples for your apple sauce


Quarter them, discard the core and chop into 3cm chunks


Add the apple to a pot with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> (300ml)</span> cold water


Bring to the boil on a medium-high heat


### Step 5

Boil for 10-15 min until the apple has softened


Once softened, remove from the heat and mash thoroughly with a potato masher


You should end up with a coarse, homemade apple sauce


### Step 6

Once the vegetables have had their initial 20 min, add the sprouts and return the tray to the oven for a further 10 min


Meanwhile, push the bread mixture aside in the bowl and beat the egg<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in with a fork


Add 60g <span class="text-danger">(120g)</span> of flour&nbsp;


Carefully stir the mixture - it should be slighly sticky, but if it's too wet add more flour


### Step 7

Wet your hands and divide the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">(12)</span> balls (slightly smaller than a golf ball)


Return the reserved pan back to a medium heat with a knob of butter and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil


When hot, add the dumplings and cook for 5 min until crispy and golden on each side (use tongs for more control)

### Step 8

Serve the stuffing balls over the apple sauce with the roast vegetables to the side


Enjoy!
