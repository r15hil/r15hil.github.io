## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper, 2/3 of your ground smoked paprika and half your dried basil (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 4

Whilst the onion softens, peel and grate half your garlic, then finely slice (don't chop!) the remaining garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Combine your mayo with the remaining dried basil, remaining ground smoked paprika, grated garlic and 1/3 of your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) – this is your smoky ranch dressing


### Step 6

Once softened, add the diced pepper and sliced garlic to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your pork & beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, then cook for a further 4 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, add the remaining white wine vinegar to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated


### Step 7

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water, then stir in your mustard ketchup and Henderson's Relish – this is your mustard ketchup stock

Add the mustard ketchup stock to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced and the sauce is glossy – this is your sloppy joe mixture

### Step 8

To serve, add a layer of fries to a plate and top with the sloppy joe mixture – these are your sloppy joe loaded fries

Dollop over the smoky ranch dressing and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
