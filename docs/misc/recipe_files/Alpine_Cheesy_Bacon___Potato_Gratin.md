### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sprinkle them with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your smoked streaky bacon roughly

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and diced onion and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp

Once the bacon is crisp, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and give it all a good mix up

Gradually add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>milk, a little at a time, and stir everything together until the sauce begins to thicken slightly

### Step 5

Stir through your double cream and most of the grated cheese (save some for later!) and give it all a good mix up until the cheese has melted

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your cheesy bacon sauce

### Step 6

Add half the potato discs to an oven-proof dish in a single layer

Pour over half the cheesy bacon sauce

Repeat this process until you have a final layer of sauce and top with any leftover potato discs

Sprinkle over the reserved grated cheese and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your Alpine cheesy bacon & potato gratin

### Step 7

While the gratin is in the oven, finely dice your tomato[es]

Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with the rocket, your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your rocket salad

### Step 8

Serve the Alpine cheesy bacon & potato gratin with the rocket salad to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
