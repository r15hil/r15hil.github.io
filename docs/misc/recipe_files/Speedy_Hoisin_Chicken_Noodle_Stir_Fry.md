### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 6-7 min

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite
