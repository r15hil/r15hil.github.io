Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to very low and add the chopped green beans to the pot

Cook, covered for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice


### Step 3

Whilst the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt, cover with a lid and cook for 5 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your smoked basa into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your tomato paste in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), black mustard seeds and curry powder to the pan and cook for 2 min

Add the tomato stock and clotted cream and cook for a further 2 min


### Step 7

Add the chopped smoked basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat  

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium, cover with a lid and cook for 4-5 min or until the basa is fully cooked – this is your smoky basa curry 

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily 

Season the smoky basa curry with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Serve the smoky basa curry with the green bean rice to the side

Enjoy!
