### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Chop the sweet potato into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season generously with salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the potato is cooked through and starting to crisp

### Step 2

Rinse the brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min, or until it's tender with a slight bite

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, add the cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds to a separate baking tray

Put them in the oven for 7 min or until slightly darkened in colour

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, remove the toasted nuts & seeds and set aside to cool

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 5

Combine the soy sauce, chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> brown sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>straight into the bowl and whisk it all together – this is your chilli lime dressing

### Step 6

Drain and rinse the black beans

Once the rice is tender, add the drained black beans to the pot and cook for a further 4 min

Drain the brown rice and black beans and allow to steam-dry for 1-2 min or until cooled slightly, before returning them both to the pot – this is your beany rice

### Step 7

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop the cooled toasted nuts & seeds together coarsely (save a few whole cashew nuts for garnish!) – this is your toasted nut & seed mix

### Step 8

Add the roasted sweet potato, chilli lime dressing, most of the chopped coriander and the toasted nut & seed mix to the beany rice and mix together gently – this is your chilli lime sweet potato & rice salad

Garnish with the reserved cashew nuts and remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
