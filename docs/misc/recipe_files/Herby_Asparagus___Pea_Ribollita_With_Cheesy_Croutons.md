Ribollita is a Tuscan bread soup with three key ingredients: bread, cannellini beans and plenty of veg. We've transformed the bread into delicious cheesy croutons, and filled it with vibrant seasonal greens.

## Ingredients

- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 390g cannellini beans
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 ciabatta
- 160g blanched peas
- 120g asparagus
- 1 leek
- 10g basil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a full kettle

Crush the garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins


### Step 2

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop half the Italian hard cheese roughly (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 3

Add the crushed garlic, chopped Italian hard cheese, half the drained cannellini beans and half the refreshed peas (save the rest for later!) to a food processor

Tear in all of the basil and add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon (you'll use the rest later!)

Add the vegetable stock mix with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> water and blitz – this is your ribollita base


### Step 4

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Reboil a kettle


### Step 5

Tear the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the torn ciabatta to a baking tray lined with tin foil

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese over the top and drizzle over a little of the ribollita base

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden – these are your cheesy croutons

Tip: Crowd the croutons together for the best melty cheese!


### Step 6

Once the leek has softened, add the remaining cannellini beans and the remaining ribollita base with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low


### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim the woody ends off the asparagus and discard them

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Add the trimmed asparagus and remaining blanched peas and cook for 3-4 min or until the asparagus is tender with a bite – this is your herby asparagus & pea ribollita

### Step 8

Serve the herby asparagus & pea ribollita in bowls with half of the cheesy croutons on top and the remaining cheesy croutons to the side for dipping

Sprinkle any leftover cheesy bits from the crouton tray over the top

Add a squeeze of the remaining lemon and a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
