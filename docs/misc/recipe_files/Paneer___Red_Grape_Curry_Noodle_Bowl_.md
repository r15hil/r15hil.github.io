## Description

As part of our Savour the Summer campaign, we present this Thai-inspired red noodle curry bowl, a summery take on a curry. Unlike other cheese, you can cook paneer, giving it a lovely golden colour. It's mild flavour works perfectly in a curry, served with juicy grapes and savoury spring onions for crunch and lift. Paneereasy!

## Ingredients

- 1 flecked coconut cream sachet (50g)
- 250g traditional paneer
- 2 tbsp Thai red curry paste 
- 2 spring onions 
- 3 kaffir lime leaves 
- 2 soy sauce sachets (24ml)
- 100g red seedless grapes 
- 100g Thai rice noodles

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle and cut the paneer into bite-size cubes


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil


Once hot, add the paneer and cook for 3-5 min or until golden on all sides, then transfer it to a plate and set aside


### Step 2

Meanwhile, place&nbsp;the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)


Add the rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water, then cook for 6 min over a high heat


Once&nbsp;cooked, drain, rinse with cold water and return them to the pot


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium heat, add the Thai red curry paste and cook for 1 min


Add the lime leaves, 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water and the soy sauce


Stir to dissolve the curry paste&nbsp;


Reduce the heat to low&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the grapes in half


Slice the spring onions finely, discarding the root ends&nbsp;


### Step 5

Squeeze the softened coconut cream into the pan and mix well


### Step 6

Add the cooked, drained noodles, paneer and grapes to the pan and cook for 1-2 min to warm through


### Step 7

Remove from the heat and stir in most of the spring onion (save a pinch for garnish)


Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper if needed


Tip: if you like the soup to be a little looser, add a little more boiled water

### Step 8

Serve the noodle curry in bowls and garnish with the remaining spring onion


Enjoy!
