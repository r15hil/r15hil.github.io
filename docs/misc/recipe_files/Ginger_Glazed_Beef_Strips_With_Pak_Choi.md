## Ingredients

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a large pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Quarter the chestnut mushrooms&nbsp;


Slice the pak&nbsp;choi&nbsp;into wedges


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over the&nbsp;highest heat


Once very hot, add a splash of vegetable oil and the beef strips and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until they're browned


Tip: don't overcook the beef or it will go chewy! If your pan is small, cook it in batches


Transfer the cooked beef strips to a large plate and set them aside to rest


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil&nbsp;


Once hot, add the&nbsp;quartered mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown


Once browned, transfer the mushrooms to the plate with the beef strips and return the pan to a low heat


### Step 5

Add the chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant&nbsp;


Add the balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, honey,&nbsp;miso paste&nbsp;and a splash of water and cook for 4-5 min &ndash; this is your ginger sauce


### Step 6

Once the brown rice is cooked, add the pak choi halves&nbsp;to the pot with the rice&nbsp;and cook, covered, for a further 3 min or until tender


Once done,&nbsp;remove the pak choi&nbsp;and set it aside


Drain the&nbsp;brown rice


### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the beef strips,&nbsp;mushrooms&nbsp;and any resting juices to the ginger sauce


Give everything a good mix up &ndash; this is your ginger beef

### Step 8

Serve the pak&nbsp;choi&nbsp;over the brown rice and top with the ginger beef&nbsp;


Garnish with the fried&nbsp;onions


Enjoy!
