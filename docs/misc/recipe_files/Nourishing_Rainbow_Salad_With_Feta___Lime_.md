- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 2 carrots
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 25g honey
- 5g coriander
- 1 lime
- 250g cooked beetroot
- 30g pumpkin seeds

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle


### Step 2

Top, tail and peel the carrots, quarter them lengthways and cut into batons

Cut each beetroot into 8 wedges

Place the carrot batons and beetroot wedges on a baking tray


### Step 3

Crumble the feta over the beetroot and carrots and sprinkle the cumin seeds over, then drizzle with the honey and 2-3 tbsp olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the carrots are slightly tender with some crunch


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a medium pan over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pumpkin seeds and toast for 3 min or until slightly darkened and starting to pop

Set the toasted pumpkin seeds aside until serving


### Step 6

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Combine the chopped coriander, chopped ginger, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Slice the remaining lime into wedges for garnish

### Step 8

Serve the roasted beetroot, carrot and feta over the bulgur wheat

Drizzle with the dressing and garnish with your toasted pumpkin seeds and lime wedges

Enjoy!
