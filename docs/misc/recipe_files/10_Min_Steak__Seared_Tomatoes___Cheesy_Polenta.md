## Ingredients

- 2 x 150g British pavé rump steak
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
-  75g polenta
- 5g rosemary
- 1/2 Knorr chicken stock cube
- 1 pot of Cornish clotted cream (40g)
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat the rump steaks dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with olive oil and season both sides with salt and pepper


### Step 3

Once very hot, add the steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side

For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube along with 450ml <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water to a pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, gradually whisk the polenta into the water in a steady stream

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking occasionally, until thickened to a mashed potato-like consistency


### Step 5

While the polenta is cooking, gently crush the garlic cloves (skins on) with the back of a knife

Chop some of the cherry tomatoes in half

Strip the rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems


### Step 6

Once the steaks are done, add them to a plate and set aside to rest

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes and remaining whole cherry tomatoes to the pan along with the rosemary leaves and crushed garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the tomatoes have started to soften

Once softened, add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[50ml]</span> boiled water and a large knob of butter and mix it all together  – this is your pan sauce


### Step 7

Once the polenta has thickened, add the clotted cream and grated Italian hard cheese and give it a really good mix up, removing any lumps – this is your cheesy polenta

Finely slice the rested steaks

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy polenta in bowls and top with the sliced steak

Pour over the pan sauce and cherry tomatoes and top with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
