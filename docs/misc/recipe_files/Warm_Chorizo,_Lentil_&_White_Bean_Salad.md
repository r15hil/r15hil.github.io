### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Add your diced chorizo and roasted garlic paste with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min further or until the shallot has softened

### Step 7

Combine the juice of half the lemon wedges with your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your zesty dressing

Add the zesty dressing to the pan with half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your warm chorizo, lentil & white bean salad

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

### Step 8

Serve the warm chorizo, lentil & white bean salad and top with a handful of shredded lettuce and the halved cherry tomatoes

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
