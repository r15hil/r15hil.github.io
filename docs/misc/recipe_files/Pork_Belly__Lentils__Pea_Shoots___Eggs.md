## Description

This is a take on an old British classic - Ham and Eggs. Here, the 'ham' is pork belly. The trick to a good pork belly is getting the fat rendered down and seasoned so you can appreciate its glorious flavour which you'll flavour with sweet, fragrant fennel seeds. Served over a carrot, pea shoot and lentil salad and topped off with a perfect egg.

## Ingredients

- 150g green speckled lentils
- 300g British pork belly 
- 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard 
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 100g carrots
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 50g pea shoots
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 2 British free range eggs

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Grind the fennel seeds&nbsp;in a pestle and mortar roughly


Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below


### Step 2

Rub the scored fat with salt, the fennel seeds and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil&ndash;try to rub the seasoning deep into the criss-cross pattern


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once very hot, add the pork, skin-side down and cook for 5-8 min or until nicely coloured on the fat side only


### Step 3

Transfer the pork (wipe the pan clean and keep it for the next step!) fat-side up, to a baking tray


Put it in the oven for 40-50 min, or until it's crispy, coloured, and cooked through


Tip: use tin foil to avoid mess!


### Step 4

Rinse the lentils&nbsp;in a sieve under the cold tap, then add them to the reserved pan&nbsp;with 1 L <span class="text-danger">[1.5 L]</span>&nbsp;cold water


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 20-25 min or until the lentils are tender


Once softened, drain the lentils and run them under cold water


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Mix the&nbsp;mustard, red wine vinegar, garlic and honey together with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your dressing


Grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 6

Once cooked, remove the pork belly from the oven, transfer to a chopping board and allow to rest for 5-10 min


Mix&nbsp;the cooked, drained, cooled lentils (keep the pan for the next step!) with the dressing, grated carrot&nbsp;and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Toss the pea shoots and dressed lentils together&nbsp;


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil


Crack the eggs into the pan and cook for 1-3 min or until done to your liking


Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, slice the pork belly into thin slices

### Step 8

Serve the pork belly over the pea shoot salad with the eggs&nbsp;on top


Enjoy!
