### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips, then strip the rosemary leaves from their stalks and chop them roughly

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a generous pinch of both salt and pepper and sprinkle over the chopped rosemary

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Add the chopped shallot to a bowl with the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a very good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

### Step 3

Divide the beef into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into patties

Cut the cheddar into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16] </span>pieces

Top the middle of each patty with 4 pieces of cheddar, seal them in with the beef (make sure there are no gaps) – these are your cheese-stuffed patties

Add the cheese-stuffed patties to an oiled baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a pot with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook them for 2-3 min

Add the chopped garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 min further

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/946.-step-5-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add the balsamic vinegar, 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> water and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil

Cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce is the consistency of ketchup

Once thickened, remove from the heat – this is your homemade ketchup

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/946.-step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Cut the ciabatta roll<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Once the burgers have 3-4 min left, add the ciabatta to the tray and return the tray to the oven until hot and crusty

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/946.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped basil to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and grind to a paste

Add 1-2 tbsp more olive oil and mix to combine – this is your basil oil

In a separate bowl, combine the white wine vinegar with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy patties over the toasted ciabatta with the rosemary chips and salad to the side

Drizzle the baby leaf salad with the dressing

Spoon the basil oil and homemade ketchup over the patties

Enjoy!
