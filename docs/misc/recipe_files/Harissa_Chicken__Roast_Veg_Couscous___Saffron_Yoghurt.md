## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) then chop into large, bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 2

Add the chopped vegetables to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and scatter with your ground coriander, a generous pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the vegetables are softened and starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your saffron to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and set aside to infuse


### Step 4

While the saffron infuses, add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water and your chopped dates, cover and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed

Add your natural yoghurt to the infused saffron water with a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your saffron yoghurt


### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chicken breast strips into small bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat


### Step 6

Once hot, add the chopped chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9 min until browned

Add your sumac, chopped garlic, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and cook for 1-2 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Fluff the couscous with a fork and mix through the roasted vegetables, half of the chopped herbs (save the rest for garnish!) and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your roast veg couscous

### Step 8

Serve the harissa & sumac chicken over the roast veg couscous

Dollop over the saffron yoghurt and garnish with the remaining chopped herbs

Enjoy!
