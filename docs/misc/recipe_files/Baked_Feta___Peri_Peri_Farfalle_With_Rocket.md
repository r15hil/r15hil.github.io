## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your sweet pointed pepper[s] roughly

Transfer your feta and chopped pepper to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the pepper is charred and the feta is golden – this is your baked feta and charred pepper


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 3

While the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 4

Combine your chipotle paste, tomato paste, dried oregano and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of your lemon[s]

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your peri peri sauce


### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your veg stock


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the peri peri sauce, soft cheese and veg stock, and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your peri peri pasta sauce


### Step 7

Once the sauce is done, add the baked feta, charred pepper and drained farfalle to the peri peri pasta sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is you baked feta & peri peri farfalle

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the baked feta & peri peri farfalle with the washed rocket to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
