### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

Boil half a kettle

### Step 4

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, tear your flat white mushrooms into large pieces, add them to the pan and cook for 2 min

Meanwhile, combine your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, mango chutney and sultanas with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 5

Crumble your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and add your curry powder and roasted garlic paste

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Add the cooked rice to the pan with the tomato stock and increase the heat to high

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2 min or until the mushrooms have softened – this is your mushroom biryani

### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate your cucumber and squeeze any excess water out of the grated cucumber

Combine the grated cucumber with your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your cucumber raita

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom biryani with a dollop of the cucumber raita, garnish with your crispy onions and dig in

Serve the cooked chicken breast to the side

Enjoy!
