## Ingredients

- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms (90g) x0
- Gochujang paste (30g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms (180g)
- White potato x3
- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- Black sesame seeds (5g)
- Spring onion
- Soy sauce (8ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are crisp and cooked through, then sprinkle over your black sesame seeds – these are your sesame potatoes


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, add your Fable pulled mushrooms to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min or until browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and soy sauce in a large bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil and half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled salad


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Combine the sliced spring onion and half your ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with your mayo

Add the remaining rice vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your spring onion & ginger mayo


### Step 5

Combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining ginger & garlic paste in a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> cold water

Mix until fully combined – this is your gochujang glaze


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms are browned, remove the dish from the oven

Add the gochujang glaze to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the pulled mushrooms are crisp and glazed – these are your Korean-style mushrooms


### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut side down

Cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

Once the mushrooms are crisp, shred them apart, using two forks – these are your Korean-style pulled mushrooms

### Step 8

Sandwich the Korean-style pulled mushrooms, some spring onion & ginger mayo and a little quick-pickled salad between the toasted brioche halves - this is your Korean-style pulled mushroom sandwich

Serve the sesame potatoes, remaining quick-pickled salad and remaining spring onion & ginger mayo to the side

Enjoy!
