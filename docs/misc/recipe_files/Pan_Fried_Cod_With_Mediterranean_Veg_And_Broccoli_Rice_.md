## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste
- 300g broccoli brown rice
- 300g Mediterranean veg mix
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 x 110g cod fillets

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the Mediterranean veg mix and cook, covered, for an initial 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Pat the cod fillets dry with kitchen paper and season them with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add the cod fillets to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

Whilst the fish is cooking, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, dried oregano and a pinch of sugar in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add the broccoli brown rice to a large, heatproof bowl and put the bowl in the microwave for 2-3 min or until piping hot


### Step 4

Once softened, add the tomato stock to the pan with the vegetables and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – these are your Mediterranean vegetables

### Step 5

Serve the Mediterranean vegetables with the heated broccoli brown rice to the side

Top the Mediterranean vegetables with the pan-fried cod

Tip: Spoon any remaining butter or juices from your pan over the cod!

Enjoy!
