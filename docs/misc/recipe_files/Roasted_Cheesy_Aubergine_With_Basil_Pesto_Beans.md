## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your blanched almonds and flaked almonds to a baking tray (keep them separate) and put it in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, set them aside and reserve the tray


### Step 2

Cut your aubergine[s] in half, lengthways

Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through the skin

Rub the flesh with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Add the scored aubergine halves to the reserved baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 3

While the aubergine is cooking, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

Grate your lighter cheese

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 4

Transfer the toasted blanched almonds (the toasted flaked almonds will be used later!), chopped garlic, chopped basil, grated cheese and the juice of half your lemon[s] to a food processor with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your basil pesto

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop the almonds with a knife, then add to a pestle & mortar!


### Step 5

Combine your tomato paste with a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your tomato sauce

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!) and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once the aubergine has slightly softened, remove the tray from the oven and top with the tomato sauce, then spread it out evenly with the back of a spoon and add the torn mozzarella

Return the tray to the oven for 10-15 min or until the mozzarella is melted and golden – this is your roasted cheesy aubergine


### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Drain and rinse your butter beans

Once the onion has softened, add the drained butter beans and basil pesto and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – these are your basil pesto beans

### Step 8

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper, then cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the basil pesto beans over the salad with the roasted cheesy aubergine to the side

Crumble over the toasted flaked almonds and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
