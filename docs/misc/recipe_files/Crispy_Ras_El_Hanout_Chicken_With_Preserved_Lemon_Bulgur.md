### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Slice half your lemon[s] as thinly as you can into rounds (save the rest for later!)

### Step 2

Add the lemon rounds to a colander and pour boiled water all over so that they start to soften

Once softened, add the lemon rounds to a small bowl with a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Cover with boiled water then set aside until later – this is your speedy preserved lemon

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt and half your ras el hanout

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the onion wedges to a baking tray with the remaining ras el hanout, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12 min or until cooked through and charred

After an initial 12 min, add your flaked almonds to the opposite side of the tray and return the tray to the oven for a further 3-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 5

Once crisped, transfer the crispy chicken to a separate baking tray (skin side up) and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy ras el hanout chicken

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!

Whilst the chicken is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems and reboil a kettle

### Step 6

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 7

Drain, then finely chop the speedy preserved lemon

Combine the bulgur wheat with the chopped preserved lemon, roasted onion wedges, sultanas, half the chopped mint and your chicken stock mix – this is your preserved lemon bulgur

Combine your natural yoghurt with juice of the remaining lemon in a small bowl – this is your lemon yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve preserved lemon bulgur and drizzle over the lemon yoghurt

Top with the crispy ras el hanout chicken and garnish with the toasted flaked almonds and remaining chopped mint

Enjoy!
