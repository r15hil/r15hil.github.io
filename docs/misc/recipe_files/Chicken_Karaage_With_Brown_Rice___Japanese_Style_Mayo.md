## Ingredients

- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Brown basmati rice (130g)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove x2
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Soy sauce (30ml)
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Soy sauce (15ml) x0
- Pak choi (200g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice each of your chicken breast portion[s] into 3-4 strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) half of your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) finely


### Step 3

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to a bowl – this is your marinade

Add the chicken strips and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later


### Step 4

Meanwhile, wash your pak choi then cut in half, separating the white base and green tops

Peel and slice the remaining garlic finely

Add your mayo and rice vinegar to a bowl and combine – this is your Japanese-style mayo


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi white bases, toasted sesame seeds and sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the pak choi has started to soften, then add the green pak choi tops and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the cooked pak choi to a plate and keep the pan for later


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your cornflour to a bowl

Add the marinated chicken strips, leaving most of the marinade behind

Give everything a good mix up so the chicken strips are fully coated in cornflour


### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat with enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken karaage

### Step 8

Serve the chicken karaage with the brown rice, pak choi and Japanese-style mayo to the side

Enjoy!
