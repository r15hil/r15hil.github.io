## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 red chilli
- 2 x 150g British pork loin steaks
- 1 rice vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 1 wholewheat noodle nest
- 1 toasted sesame oil sachet (15ml)
- 1 chilli jam pot (25g)
- 1 carrot
- 1 soy sauce sachet (30ml)
- 10g coriander & mint mix
- 1/2 cucumber
- 15g fresh root ginger

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Combine the chilli jam with half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!) in a medium bowl – this is your pork glaze

Add the pork loin steaks to the bowl and give everything a good mix up

Set aside for later


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and run under cold water until cooled

Once cooled, set aside for later


### Step 3

Whilst the noodles are cooking, transfer the pork loin steaks to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Combine the chopped ginger, rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your spicy dressing


### Step 5

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the cucumber into rough, bite-sized pieces

Wash the little gem lettuce, then tear into rough bite-sized pieces

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, de-seed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips


### Step 6

Remove the cooked pork from the oven and transfer to a clean chopping board

Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for 2 min

Meanwhile, pick the coriander and mint leaves from the stalks and chop them roughly


### Step 7

Slice the rested pork finely

Add the chopped herbs, ripped little gem, chopped cucumber, grated carrot, red chilli (not a fan of spice? Only add a little), cooked noodles and spicy dressing to a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy noodle salad

### Step 8

Serve the sliced pork over the spicy noodle salad

Enjoy!
