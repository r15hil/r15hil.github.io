## Description

Warm tortillas are sold throughout Mexico like nothing else. Gracing the dusty streets, they are made then and there in a rough and ready manner, to be filled with ground beef, rice, salad and lime. The tortillas are smaller than the ones we are used to, for the sole reason of managability, and to be eaten on the go.

## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar 
- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 tomato
- 75g fragrant basmati rice 
- 200g British beef mince 
- 1 tsp ground cumin seeds
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 1 tsp smoky chipotle paste
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)
- 1 lime 
- 1 onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the rice and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the onion, cover with a lid and cook for 5-10 min or until beginning to soften and brown slightly


### Step 3

Meanwhile, zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)


Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Dice the tomatoe<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 4

Add the beef mince&nbsp;to the softened onion


Add the cumin and chipotle paste to the pan and cook for 5-7 min, breaking the mince up as you go, until browned and cooked through&nbsp;


Once done, remove from the heat, cover with a lid and set aside to keep warm until serving


### Step 5

Meanwhile, warm the tortillas by placing them over the rice, once it has cooked (they only need a few min to warm through)


Grate the cheddar cheese


Cut the little gem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in half then shred finely


### Step 6

Combine the lime zest and the juice from the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with the mayonnaise


Add a small pinch of salt and pepper then mix thoroughly - this is your lime mayonnaise


### Step 7

Remove the warmed tortillas from the rice and fluff the cooked rice with a fork, seasoning with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Serve the tortillas, beef, tomatoes, lettuce and cheese on a large platter&nbsp;


Assemble your own tacos and drizzle with the lime mayo&nbsp;


Enjoy!
