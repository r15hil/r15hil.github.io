## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your cider vinegar

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your peri peri sauce


### Step 4

Add half of the peri peri sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate large bowl with your chicken thighs and mix well until they're fully coated

Transfer the coated chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your peri peri chicken thighs

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use two trays!


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, combine the remaining peri peri sauce with the mayo – this is your perinaise


### Step 6

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skin on) into matchsticks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 7

Combine the grated carrot, apple matchsticks, sliced spring onion and a drizzle of the perinaise (save the rest for later!) – this is your apple slaw

Slice the peri peri chicken thighs finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced peri peri chicken thighs with the chips, apple slaw and the remaining perinaise to the side

Enjoy!
