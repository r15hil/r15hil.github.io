## Ingredients

- 50g soft cheese 
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 leek
- 5g parsley
- 25g walnuts 
- 120g spelt
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat, and boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Once hot, add a knob of butter to the pan

Once melted, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Once the shallot has softened, add the Chinese rice wine and spelt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further

Add the vegetable stock and cook, covered, for 25-30 min, stirring occasionally, until the spelt is tender with a slight bite

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 3

Whilst the spelt is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then slice finely

Roughly chop the walnuts


### Step 4

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped walnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer the walnuts to a plate and set aside


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and caramelised

Tip: Try not to move the mushrooms around too much as this will stop them from caramelising!


### Step 6

Once caramelised, add the chopped garlic and sliced leek to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the leek has started to soften

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once the spelt is tender with a slight bite and all the liquid has been absorbed, stir through the chopped parsley, soft cheese and half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add the leek and caramelised mushrooms to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your caramelised mushroom & parsley speltotto

### Step 8

Serve the caramelised mushroom & parsley speltotto

Garnish with the toasted walnuts and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and top with a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
