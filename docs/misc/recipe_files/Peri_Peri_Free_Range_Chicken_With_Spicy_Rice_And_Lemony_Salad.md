### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and finely dice

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, ground turmeric and half your tomato paste (you'll use the rest later!) in 400ml<span class="text-purple"> [600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until they've softened slightly

### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice, tomato stock and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your spicy rice

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar, chipotle paste, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining tomato paste with the juice of half the lemon[s] in a large mixing bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your peri peri sauce

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1713869594990-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to the peri peri sauce and stir it all together until fully coated

Transfer the coated chicken to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and drizzle over any remaining peri peri sauce

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri free range chicken

### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lemon into 2 wedges per person

Wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then finely shred 

Combine your mayo with the juice of half the lemon wedges and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your lemon mayo

Add the shredded lettuce to the bowl with the lemon mayo, then give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony salad

### Step 8

Serve the peri peri free range chicken with the spicy rice and lemony salad to the side

Garnish with a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!
