### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Remove the skin from your smoked mackerel fillet[s] and discard

Chop the mackerel into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped mackerel to a bowl with your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the mackerel is coated – this is your coated mackerel

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the coated mackerel and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp – this is your crispy mackerel

Transfer the crispy mackerel to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 4

Bash your cucumber[s] with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Add the smashed cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar – this is your quick-pickled smashed cucumber

### Step 5

Add your mooli slaw to a bowl with your mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your mooli slaw

### Step 6

Carefully wipe the reserved pan with some kitchen paper (it will be hot!) and return it to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

### Step 7

Add your gochujang (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mirin to a bowl with a knob of butter

Put the bowl in the microwave for 30 secs or until the butter has melted – this is your bibimbap sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cooked rice in a bowl and top with the crispy mackerel, quick-pickled smashed cucumber and mooli slaw

Drizzle over the bibimbap sauce

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Tip: To eat this the Korean way, give everything a mix up to coat it all in the bibimbap sauce

Enjoy!
