## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped veg to a baking tray with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is cooked through and tender


### Step 3

Chop your meat-free sausages roughly

Add the chopped meat-free sausages to a separate lightly oiled tray and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until cooked through and browned

Tip: Make sure the pieces have space between them!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste and balsamic vinegar and stir it all together – this is your tomato stock

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min

Add the tomato stock and dried oregano and cook for 3-4 min or until reduced to a thick tomato sauce-like consistency


### Step 7

Once the veg is cooked, remove from the oven and add it to the pan

Add the drained tortiglioni with a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened and well combined

Stir through the cooked meat-free sausages – this is your roasted veg & meat-free sausage pasta

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the roasted veg & meat-free sausage pasta

Garnish with the chopped basil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
