### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Slice your pepperoni into thin strips

Once hot, add the pepperoni strips and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Wash, then chop your cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

### Step 4

Add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Once the pepperoni has started to brown, add the chopped cavolo nero and sliced garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the cavolo nero has wilted

### Step 6

Once wilted, add your chicken stock mix, chopped tomatoes and dried oregano to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained tortelloni to the pan with a knob of butter and gently stir it all together until the pasta is coated in sauce – this is your pepperoni & cavolo nero sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick

### Step 8

Serve the pepperoni & cavolo nero sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind on black pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
