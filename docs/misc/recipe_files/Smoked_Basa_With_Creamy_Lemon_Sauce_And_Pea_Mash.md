### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes then chop them into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your soft cheese in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> boiled water – this is your soft cheese mixture

### Step 3

Once the potatoes have been cooking for 10 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add your smoked basa fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 4

Transfer the cooked basa to a plate and cover with tin foil to keep warm

Reserve the pan

### Step 5

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add your blanched peas and cook for 1 min further

Drain the potatoes and peas and return them to the pot to steam dry

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter, then once melted, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the soft cheese mixture with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a grind of black pepper

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy lemon sauce

Tip: If your sauce is too lemony, add a pinch of salt to temper the acidity

### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes and peas to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash together – this is your pea mash

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa over the creamy lemon sauce with the pea mash to the side

Garnish with a handful of salad and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
