## Description

Gammon is essentially uncooked ham. It's taken from the hind of pork leg and is salt-cured in the same way as bacon. Usually the preserve of Christmas, we thought we'd break the rules and enjoy ours midweek with a honey-mustard glaze.

## Ingredients

- 1 x 300g British baby gammon joint
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 400g potatoes
- 100g corn salad
- 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)
- 30g dried cranberries

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Heat a dry pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the baby gammon joint<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;and cook on all sides until browned (this is known as searing) for approx. 5 min&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine the honey with half of the&nbsp;mustard, reserving&nbsp;the remaining mustard for step 5


Cover the cranberries in enough boiled water to cover them and set&nbsp;them aside, this rehydrates them so they plump up a little&nbsp;


### Step 3

Place the seared gammon in a tin foil package, folding up the edges to keep the juices in&nbsp;


Pour the honey mustard mixture over the gammon


Place the tray in the oven for 30-40min&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


Place&nbsp;the potatoes on a separate baking tray and drizzle with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


Put&nbsp;the potatoes in the oven for 25-30 min or until crispy and golden


### Step 5

Combine the remaining&nbsp;mustard with the mayonnaise and set aside until serving - this is your wholegrain mustard mayo


Grab a tea, or take some time to clear up while the gammon and potatoes tick away&nbsp;


### Step 6

Remove the cooked gammon from the oven and allow it to rest on a clean chopping board for 5 min


### Step 7

Drain the plumped cranberries and mix them through the salad, with a little olive oil and salt and pepper

### Step 8

Slice the rested gammon finely with a&nbsp;sharp knife


Serve the gammon with the honey mustard juices spooned over


Serve the roasted potatoes, cranberry salad and wholegrain mustard mayo&nbsp;to the side


Enjoy!
