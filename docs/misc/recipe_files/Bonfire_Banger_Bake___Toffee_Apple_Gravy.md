## Ingredients

- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 1 Catherine wheel sausage (227g)
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 apple
- 120g traditional puff pastry
- 150g spring greens

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil a kettle

Unroll the puff pastry and add it to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Tip: Use 2 trays if you're cooking for 4!

Add the Catherine wheel sausage<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the centre of the puff pastry


### Step 2

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the pastry is golden and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your bonfire banger bake


### Step 3

Peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil a full kettle


### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, slice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely (skin on), discarding the core

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced apple with 1.5 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 5

While the apple caramelises, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Once caramelised, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up until a sandy paste forms

Gradually stir the beef stock into the sandy paste and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your toffee apple gravy


### Step 6

Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Heat a separate pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat

Once boiling, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 2-3 min or until tender

Once tender, drain and return the pot


### Step 7

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Cut the bonfire banger bake in half and serve with the mash and spring greens to the side

Drizzle the toffee apple gravy all over and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
