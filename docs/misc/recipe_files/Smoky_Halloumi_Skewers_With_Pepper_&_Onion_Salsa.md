![Step 1 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-1-1623670019887-x200.jpg)

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins-on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp - these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 2

Soak the skewers in cold water (this stops them from burning whilst cooking!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper, sliced onion and a pinch of salt, then cook for 2 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 min or until caramelised

### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut your halloumi in half lengthways (where the natural crease forms), and then cut each half into 2 strips, so you end up with 2 per person

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika over the halloumi strips and pat it on all the sides until evenly coated

Carefully thread each coated halloumi strip onto a soaked skewer (try not to break them!) – these are your smoky halloumi skewers

### Step 5

Once done, transfer the caramelised pepper & onion to a bowl (reserve the pan!)

Add half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), the chopped coriander and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] [1 tsp] </span>sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your pepper & onion salsa

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1623670046302-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the smoky halloumi skewers<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 6 min, turning so they brown on all sides

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1623670051381-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whilst the halloumi is cooking, combine your mayo with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining red wine vinegar in a small bowl – this is your spicy mayo

### Step 8

Serve the smoky halloumi skewers with the pepper & onion salsa, crispy potatoes and spicy mayo to the side

Enjoy!
