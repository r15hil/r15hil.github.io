## Ingredients

- Red onion x2
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Cheddar cheese (40g) x2
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Sun-dried tomato pesto (45g)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Rosemary (5g)
- Courgette
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)

Chop your courgette[s] into thick discs, approx. 2cm thick


### Step 2

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves


### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes, courgette discs and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!)

Add the rosemary leaves, dried oregano, a pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the veg is soft and the potatoes are crisp


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray(or two!)


### Step 5

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Top the chicken with your sun-dried tomato pesto and grated cheese

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 18-20 min or until the cheese is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheddar cheese & red pesto chicken


### Step 7

Once the veg is done, carefully remove and discard the skins and root[s] of the roasted onion

### Step 8

Serve the cheddar cheese & red pesto chicken with the roasted veg to the side

Pour over any remaining pesto sauce from the chicken tray[s]

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
