### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, combine your soy sauce, honey and hoisin sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a bowl – this is your hoisin marinade

### Step 3

Trim the green stalks off your aubergine[s]

Cut the aubergine[s] in half lengthways, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

### Step 4

Transfer the aubergine halves to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) then drizzle over half the hoisin marinade (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the aubergine is tender – this is your hoisin roasted aubergine

### Step 5

While the aubergine is cooking, wash, then chop the roots from your pak choi and separate the leaves, discarding the roots

Chop any larger leaves in half

Trim your spring onion[s], then chop each spring onion into thirds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

### Step 6

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves, chopped spring onion and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, edamame beans and your toasted sesame oil and cook for 1 min further – these are your sesame greens

### Step 7

Add your black sesame seeds to the cooked rice and fluff with a fork – this is your sesame rice

Heat a separate, large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining hoisin marinade along with a splash of water and cook for 1-2 min until thickened – this is your hoisin glaze

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin roasted aubergine over the sesame rice and drizzle with the hoisin glaze

Serve the sesame greens to the side

Enjoy!
