## Ingredients

- Baguettes (2pcs)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- British skinless chicken thighs (160g) x0
- White cup mushrooms (80g)
- Carrot
- British skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil  and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Slice your white cup mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 6-8 min or until browned


### Step 4

Peel half your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons and grate the remaining carrot[s]

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways then slice half the cucumber lengthways, and slice the remaining cucumber into half moons

Strip your mint leaves from their stems

Finely chop half your mint and coriander and set aside the remaining leaves


### Step 5

Combine half your rice vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with the grated carrot, cucumber half moons, chopped herbs and a pinch of salt – this is your pickled salad

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with the remaining rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a small splash of cold water – this is your sriracha mayo


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms are browned, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to a food processor with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your mushroom pâté


### Step 7

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board (reserve the tray!) and shred apart using two forks – this is your pulled chicken

Combine your red chilli relish and pulled chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until well coated – this is your sweet chilli chicken

Discard the tin foil from the reserved tray, then add your baguette[s] and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through and crusty

### Step 8

Slice each warmed baguette in half (without cutting all the way through) and open it out like a book

Spread over the mushroom pâté and top with the sweet chilli chicken, carrot ribbons, cucumber slices and reserved mint & coriander leaves – this is your sweet chilli chicken & mushroom báhn mì

Serve the pickled salad and sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!
