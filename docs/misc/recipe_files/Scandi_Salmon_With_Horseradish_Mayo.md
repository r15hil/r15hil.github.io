## Description

We love simple, clean flavours when it comes to great fish in the summer sun. Here, we turn to Scandinavia. You'll pan-fry your salmon, then finish it in the oven for perfect, succulence. Served with a warm potato salad, fresh cucumber for crunch and a horseradish mayo for drizzling over all the different components. Scandilously good!
