## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Sausage meat (150g)
- Gochujang paste (30g)
- Tortiglioni (200g)
- Spring onion
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Garlic clove x3
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Leek

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add 2/3 of the sliced garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2-3 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Watch the garlic like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!

Once golden, transfer the garlic to kitchen paper, set aside and reserve the pan for later – this is your crispy garlic


### Step 3

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and set aside until later


### Step 4

While the tortiglioni is cooking, return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the sausage is starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the sausage meat has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the sliced leek and a small pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until softened


### Step 6

Add the remaining sliced garlic and gochujang (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soft cheese and chicken stock mix to the pan with the spinach and a splash of starchy pasta water and mix it all together

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the spinach has wilted, add the drained tortiglioni to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Remove the pan from the heat, stir through most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and a knob of butter – this is your creamy gochujang sausage & leek tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the creamy gochujang sausage & leek tortiglioni

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, sliced spring onion and the crispy garlic

Enjoy!
