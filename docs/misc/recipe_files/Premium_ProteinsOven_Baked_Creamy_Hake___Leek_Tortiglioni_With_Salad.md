## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Wash your leek[s] thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves then top, tail and slice into rounds


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and a pinch of salt to the dish

Meanwhile, chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Once hot, add your vegetable stock mix to the dish with your tortiglioni, Chinese rice wine and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water

Nestle the pasta into the water as much as you can, then give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add the chopped hake to the dish and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta and hake are cooked through (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily)

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!


### Step 6

Once the pasta is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your crème fraîche and grated Italian hard cheese

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your oven-baked creamy hake & leek tortiglioni


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the oven-baked creamy hake & leek tortiglioni with the salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Drizzle the salad with olive oil and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Dig in!
