Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Trim, then cut your asparagus in half

### Step 2

Add the onion wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until softened

Whilst the onion is cooking, combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), maple syrup and half of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) in a bowl – this is your sticky sauce

### Step 3

Add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles, then set aside to soak for 4 min

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Drain your tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu in half and then cut each half into thick strips

### Step 4

Once hot, add the tofu strips to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crisp

### Step 5

After an initial 3 min, add the halved asparagus to the pot with the noodles and cook for a further 3 min or until everything is tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and return to the pot

### Step 6

Once the tofu is crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add the sticky sauce

Cook for 1 min further until sticky and caramelised

Once caramelised, add your black sesame seeds and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 30 secs further, or until slightly loosened – this is your sticky sesame tofu

### Step 7

Once the onion has softened, add it to the noodles with your toasted sesame oil, a squeeze of lime juice and the remaining soy sauce and give everything a good mix up – these are your asparagus noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the sticky sesame tofu over the asparagus noodles

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
