### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until softened but not browned

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, stir your arborio rice into the pan, making sure the grains of rice are coated in oil

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until it has evaporated

Reduce the heat to medium-low

### Step 4

Add 1/3 of the vegetable stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed into the rice

Continue to add the remaining vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring more or less continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto

### Step 5

While the risotto is cooking, cut the lemon[s] in half

Peel the skin off your smoked mackerel fillet[s] and discard

Tear the smoked mackerel into small, rough pieces (watch out for small bones!)

### Step 6

Once all the stock has been absorbed, add the smoked mackerel pieces with a knob of butter to the pan

Continue to cook until all of the butter is melted and the risotto is creamy

### Step 7

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your soft cheese and the juice of half your lemon[s] into the risotto

Season very generously with pepper (use much more than you normally would!) – this is your smoked mackerel & lemon risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person 

Wash your salad, then gently pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the smoked mackerel & lemon risotto in a bowl topped with a handful of salad and a lemon wedge

Drizzle the salad with olive oil

Enjoy!
