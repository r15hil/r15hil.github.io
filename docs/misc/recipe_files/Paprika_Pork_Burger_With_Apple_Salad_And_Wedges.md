## Ingredients

- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- British pork mince (125g) x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- British pork mince (250g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Apple
- Spring onion
- Red onion x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle them with vegetable oil, then season with half of your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min until crisp – these are your paprika wedges


### Step 2

While the potato wedges are cooking, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with the remaining ground smoked paprika and half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest for later!) in a bowl and season very generously with salt and pepper

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!) and refrigerate (this helps them hold their shape whilst cooking) – these are your paprika pork patty[ies]


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later


### Step 4

Peel your red onions, then slice into thin rings

Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the red onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion rings have started to caramelise

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar, mayo, remaining sliced spring onion, 2 tbsp [3 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your salad dressing

Slice your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skin on) thinly, discard the core then add to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the paprika pork patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip each paprika pork patty and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and mix it all together – this is your apple salad

### Step 8

To assemble, sandwich the paprika pork patty[ies], caramelised onion rings and some apple salad between your toasted brioche halves – these are your paprika pork burgers

Serve the paprika wedges and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!
