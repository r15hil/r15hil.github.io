### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened and starting to caramelise

### Step 4

Once softened, add the chopped ginger and chopped garlic to the pan with your ground turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala and tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your vegetable stock mix with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil then cook for 3 min or until reduced to a curry-like consistency

### Step 5

Once reduced, top the sauce with your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with a pinch of salt – this is your coriander rice

### Step 7

Once the haddock is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your clotted cream – this is your butter haddock

Tip: Stir gently so that your fish doesn't break apart!

### Step 8

Serve the butter haddock over the coriander rice

Enjoy!
