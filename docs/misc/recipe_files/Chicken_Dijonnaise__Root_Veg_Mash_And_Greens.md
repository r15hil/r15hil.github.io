Add the chicken stock and cook for 2-3 min or until it's starting to thicken

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the shredded spring greens to the tray[s] with the chicken and return it to the oven for 4-5 min or until the greens are wilted and tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp]</span> butter and a splash of milk to the cooked parsnips and carrots

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your root veg mash

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board and serve it over the Dijonnaise sauce with the root veg mash and spring greens to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
