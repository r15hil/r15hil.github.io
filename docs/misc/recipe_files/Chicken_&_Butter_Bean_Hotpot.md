### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Trim, then chop your carrot[s] into rounds (no need to peel!)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Carefully arrange the potato discs over the top of the hotpot filling

Season with a pinch of salt and put the dish in the oven for an initial 25 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

After 25 min, trim, then add your green beans to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the beans are tender and lightly golden, the hotpot is bubbling and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 8

To serve, set the chicken thigh & butter bean hotpot and roasted beans in the centre of the table

Dig in!
