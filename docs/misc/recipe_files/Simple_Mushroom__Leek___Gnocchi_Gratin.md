### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown

### Step 2

While the mushrooms are cooking, wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Combine the panko breadcrumbs with the dried basil, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your basil crumb

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water and add the Dijon mustard, soft cheese and a very generous grind of pepper – this is your stock

### Step 6

Once the leek has softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min, then gradually add the stock and cook for 1-2 min further or until a creamy consistency – this is your creamy mushroom mixture

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1628681815204-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Top the gnocchi with the creamy mushroom mixture and give everything a good mix up

Top with the basil crumb

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the basil crumb is golden and crispy – this is your mushroom, leek & gnocchi gratin

### Step 8

Leave the mushroom, leek & gnocchi gratin to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!
