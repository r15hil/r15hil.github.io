## Ingredients

- 1 tomato
- 1 courgette 
- 1 tin of cannellini beans
- 2 British minute steaks
- 300g potatoes
- 10g fresh basil
- 4 garlic cloves
- 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Peel and cut the potatoes into rough, bite-size pieces (skins on)


Peel the garlic


Add the potatoes and whole garlic cloves to a pot (with a matching lid) of salted boiling water


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Bring the pot to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until fork-tender&nbsp;


Once cooked, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and splash of milk, then cover and set aside until step 7&nbsp;


Tip: Covering the hot, cooked potatoes encourages them to steam and they will mash more easily


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the courgette<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into quarters lengthways, then into bite-size pieces


Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">(es)</span> into a large dice


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Add 2-3 tbsp vegetable oil to a pan over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the courgette and a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until coloured


Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the tomatoes with a pinch of sugar and cook for a further 5 min or until slightly softened, then remove from the heat and set aside


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Pat the steaks dry with kitchen towel, rub both sides with vegetable oil and season both sides with salt


Heat a separate pan over a medium-high heat


### Step 6

Once the pan is very hot, add the steaks and cook for 1 min on one side only


Flip the steak and add the balsamic vinegar with a pinch of sugar (this helps it caramelise)&nbsp;


Cook for 1 min further, then transfer the cooked steaks (with any remaining balsamic) to a plate and cover with a tea towel to 'rest' until serving


### Step 7

Mash the potatoes until smooth and season very generously with salt and pepper


Rinse and drain the cannellini beans and add them to the mash


Place the pot over a medium-low heat and cook for 3 min or until the beans are warmed through

### Step 8

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Serve the steak along with any resting juices and excess balsamic over the mash with the courgette and tomato to the side


Scatter over the basil


Enjoy!
