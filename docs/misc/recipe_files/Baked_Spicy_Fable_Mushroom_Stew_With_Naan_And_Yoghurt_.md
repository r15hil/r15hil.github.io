### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish
