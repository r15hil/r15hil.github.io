### Step 1

Peel your garlic and ginger, then slice your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Chop all of these together as finely as you can

Tip: If you can't handle the heat, save some of the chilli for another recipe!

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Once the lean beef mince has started to brown, add the sticky stir-fry sauce to the pan with half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
