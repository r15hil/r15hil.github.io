## Ingredients

- 1 crème fraîche
- 1 Beef Joint 300g
- 1 gravy base
- 4 white potato
- 1 blanched peas
- 2 carrot
- 1 wholegrain mustard
- 1 horseradish sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 230ºC/ 210ºC (fan)/ gas 8

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a generous splash of cold water, a knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around them to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (or two!), then put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 12 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a large heat-proof bowl covered with cling film

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are slightly tender / fork tender


### Step 3

Remove the string from your beef joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rub over your wholegrain mustard, a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coated beef


### Step 4

Once the veg has had an initial 12 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped potatoes (reserve the bowl for later!) and coated beef with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 22-25 min or until the beef is cooked through and slightly pink inside

Tip: Prefer no pink meat? Cook your beef for 3-5 min longer!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wipe clean the reserved bowl and combine your crème fraîche and horseradish with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your horseradish crème fraîche


### Step 6

Once the beef has been cooking for 22-25 min, boil a kettle

Remove the beef from the oven, transfer it to a clean chopping board and leave to rest for 4-5 min – this is your mustard roast beef

Add your blanched peas to the parcel with the carrot batons

Return the tray to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the potatoes are roasted and golden and the peas are warmed through


### Step 7

Once everything is nearly ready, combine your gravy base with 125ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof jug, whisk thoroughly

Put the jug in the microwave and cook for 30-40 secs or until thickened and give everything a good mix up – this is your gravy

### Step 8

Slice the rested beef finely

Serve the sliced beef with the roast potatoes, buttered veg and horseradish crème fraîche to the side

Drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!
