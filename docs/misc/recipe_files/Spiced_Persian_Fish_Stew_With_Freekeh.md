## Ingredients

- 1 tomato paste sachet (16g)
- 2 tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 green chilli
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tamarind paste sachet (15g)
- 10g coriander
- 1/2 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 130g freekeh
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the freekeh, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat<br /><br />Cook for 20-25 min or until tender but with a bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

<span class="text-highlight">Peel and</span> finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic


Chop the tomatoes into small, bite-sized pieces


Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Boil a kettle<br /><br />Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat<br /><br />Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop the basa fillets into large, bite-sized pieces<br /><br />Dissolve <span class="text-highlight">1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> the</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and add the tomato paste and tamarind paste – this is your tamarind stock<br /><br />


### Step 5

Once the shallot has started to soften, add the chopped garlic, chopped tomatoes and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2 min<br /><br />Add the ground fenugreek, turmeric and paprika and cook for 1 min further or until everything is combined


### Step 6

<span class="text-highlight">While the shallots are cooking,</span> add the tamarind stock and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2 min further or until the stock has reduced slightly


Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

<span class="text-highlight">Once the stock has reduced,</span> add the chopped basa and chopped coriander to the pan and cook, covered for 4-5 min until the fish is cooked through – this is your Persian fish stew<br /><br />Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Persian fish stew over the cooked freekeh


Garnish with the <span class="text-highlight">remaining</span> chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)


Enjoy!
