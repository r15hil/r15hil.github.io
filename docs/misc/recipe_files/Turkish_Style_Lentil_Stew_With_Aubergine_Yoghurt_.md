## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk[s] on, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

Add the aubergine half[ves] to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into 3 wedges per person

Cut your tomato[es] into 3 wedges per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 3

Once hot, add your drained green lentils, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried oregano and cook for 30 secs

Add half your vegetable stock mix (you’ll use the rest later!) with your tomato paste, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and a grind of pepper and give everything a good stir

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened, then remove from the heat – this is your Turkish-style lentil stew


### Step 4

Once the aubergine has had an initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and press the flesh down firmly with a fork to release the juices (this will help them cook quicker!)

Add the tomato and onion wedges to the tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt -  these are your roasted vegetables

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min further or until the aubergine flesh has softened and everything is tender


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Dissolve the remaining vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water in a large bowl

Add your couscous to the large bowl with the vegetable stock, stir it all together, then cover and set aside


### Step 6

Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skins with a fork, discard the skins

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily!

Chop the aubergine flesh up all together until finely chopped


### Step 7

Add the chopped aubergine flesh to a bowl with the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt

Stir it all together – this is your aubergine yoghurt

Fluff the couscous with a fork

Return the Turkish-style lentil stew to a medium heat to warm through

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine yoghurt over the fluffed couscous, then top with the Turkish-style lentil stew and roasted vegetables

Garnish with the chopped dill and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
