## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice your red onion[s] finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter alternative over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add most of the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, heat a pot with a lid, with a knob of butter alternative over a high heat

Once melted, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your cauliflower[s] into small florets

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 5

Combine your chopped dates, tamarind paste, vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your date & tamarind stock


### Step 6

Add the chopped ginger, ground turmeric, curry powder and a generous grind of black pepper to the softened onion and cook for 30 secs

Add the date & tamarind stock to the pan with the cauliflower florets, then give everything a good mix up and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the cauliflower is tender and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your cauliflower, date & tamarind curry


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Dice your tomato[es] and cucumber[s]

Combine the diced tomato, diced cucumber and remaining sliced onion in a bowl with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Add the chopped coriander just before serving – this is your kachumber

### Step 8

Serve the cauliflower, date & tamarind curry over the basmati rice with the kachumber to the side

Enjoy!
