Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 2

Slice your rump steak[s] into thin strips

Add to a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin, half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and your rice vinegar

Season with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up, then keep to one side until later

Once the sliced rump steak has browned, add your cooked white long grain rice and cook for 2-3 min or until piping hot, breaking up the rice with a wooden spoon as you go

Once hot, push the rice to one side of the pan, add the toasted sesame oil and the beaten eggs

Let the eggs set for 30 secs
