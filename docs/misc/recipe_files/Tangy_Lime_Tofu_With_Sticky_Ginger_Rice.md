### Step 1

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[400ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, add the chopped ginger and reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky ginger rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into cubes

Add the tofu cubes to a bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and set aside to marinate

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 4

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half

Add half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) to a small bowl and squeeze the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] over, then place the squeezed half[ves] on top for added pickling – this is your zingy quick-pickled onion

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated tofu cubes and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the tofu is golden, transfer it to a clean plate then return the pan to a medium-high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

### Step 6

Boil half a kettle

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and remaining sliced onion and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, remove the pan from the heat and add the spinach with a splash of water

Return the pan to the heat and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1623678036597-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once wilted, return the golden tofu to the pan with your cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Add the remaining soy sauce, vegetable stock mix, agave, lime zest and the juice from the remaining lime with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water

Stir everything together and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened to a syrup-like consistency – this is your tangy lime tofu

### Step 8

Serve the tangy lime tofu with the sticky ginger rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top with the zingy quick-pickled onion and sprinkle your black sesame seeds all over

Enjoy!
