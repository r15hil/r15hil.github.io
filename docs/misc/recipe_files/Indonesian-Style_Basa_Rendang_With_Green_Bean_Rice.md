### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the halved green beans to the pot

Cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice

### Step 3

While the rice and green beans are cooking, peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pod[s]

Grind the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, cardamom seeds, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a coarse paste – this is your spice paste

### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water then add your fish sauce – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Cut your basa fillet[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the spice paste to a bowl and mix thoroughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle<span class="text-danger"> </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for an initial 1 min on each side

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1633970299577-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the coconut stock and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min further or until the basa is cooked through, the liquid has evaporated, and the sauce is very thick – this is your Indonesian-style basa rendang

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Fluff the green bean rice with a fork

Enjoy!
