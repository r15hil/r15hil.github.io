This New York deli style melt is a mouthwatering favourite in the concrete jungle. It’s a toasty, tangy version of a cheese and ham sarnie, with bursts of flavour in every bite.

Add the sweet potato chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Slice 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> discs from the cucumber (these will go in your sandwich later!)


Slice the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, then slice the halves into wedges


Chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Spread the ciabatta base with the mustard ketchup
