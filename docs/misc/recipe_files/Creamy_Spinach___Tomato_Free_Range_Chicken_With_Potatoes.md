### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) roughly into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your cherry tomatoes

Drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until everything is starting to brown

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can
