## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat and boil a kettle

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] (skin-side down), season with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 4

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with a matching lid with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 2-3 min or until almost cooked

Wash your spinach then shake off any excess water


### Step 5

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your crème fraîche to a bowl with your wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and vegetable stock mix

Add the chopped garlic, most of the chopped dill (save some for garnish!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and mix it all together – this is your creamy mustard sauce


### Step 6

Once the broccoli is almost cooked, add the spinach to the pot

Cook for a final 1 min or until the spinach has wilted, then drain, return to the pot and keep covered until serving – these are your greens

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add small knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Crush the seasoned potatoes lightly with a fork – these are your crushed potatoes


### Step 7

Once the salmon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the creamy mustard sauce to the pan

Tip: Be careful, the sauce will sizzle from the heat of the pan!

Cook for 30 secs or until the sauce is warmed through – this is your creamy mustard salmon

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mustard salmon over the crushed potatoes with the greens to the side

Pour over the remaining mustard sauce and garnish with the reserved chopped dill and a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
