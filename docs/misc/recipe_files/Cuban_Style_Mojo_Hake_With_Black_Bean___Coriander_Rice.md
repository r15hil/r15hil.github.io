## Description

This zesty marinade is a Cuban classic. You’ll coat tender hake in a tangy blend of orange, chilli, garlic and coriander before baking it in the oven. Serve with herby black bean rice to finish. Delicioso.

## Ingredients

- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- White long grain rice (50g) x0
- Red onion
- Orange
- Black beans (185g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- White long grain rice (100g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Sweet pointed pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your orange[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half, then cut half your orange[s] into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>orange wedge per person

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely, then roughly chop the leaves and keep separate

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add the juice of the remaining orange halves (save the wedges for garnish!) to a small bowl with your ground cumin, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped coriander stalks, cider vinegar and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix until fully combined – this is your mojo-style marinade


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the sliced red onion and sliced pepper to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, and give everything a good mix up


### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat, and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 5

Cut a large piece of tin foil and place your hake fillets in the centre of the foil

Pour the mojo-style marinade over the hake fillets, then scrunch the edges of the foil together around the fish to form a tightly sealed parcel

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!


### Step 6

Add the foil parcel[s] to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the onion has softened – this is your Cuban-style mojo hake & roast veg

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Add the drained black beans to the cooked rice with half the chopped coriander leaves (save the rest for garnish!), the remaining chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt

Mix it all together and cook over a medium-low heat for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your black bean & coriander rice

### Step 8

Serve the black bean & coriander rice and roast veg topped with the Cuban-style mojo hake

Drizzle the remaining cooking juices from the foil parcel[s] over the fish

Garnish with an orange wedge and the remaining chopped coriander leaves

Enjoy!
