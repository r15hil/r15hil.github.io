### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Wash your leek[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Once the mushrooms have started to soften, add the sliced leek, chopped garlic and dried oregano and cook for 2-3 min further

Add a splash of your creamy single soy to a bowl and reserve for later (you'll use this to glaze the pastry!)

### Step 4

Once the leek has started to soften, add your wholegrain mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!), remaining creamy single soy and vegetable stock mix

Add a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until everything is combined – this is your creamy leek & mushroom pie filling

### Step 5

Add the creamy leek & mushroom pie filling to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and score a criss-cross pattern across the top with a knife

### Step 6

Lay the puff pastry sheet over the pie dish[es] and trim off any excess

Tip: Use any excess pastry to add decorations to the pie!

Press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish[es], then brush the reserved creamy single soy all over

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 20-25 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your plant-based creamy leek & mushroom pie

### Step 7

Once the pie is almost done, boil a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 1-2 min or until bright green and tender

Once done, drain the peas and return them to the pot with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based creamy leek & mushroom pie with the peas to the side

Enjoy!
