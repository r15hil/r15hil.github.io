### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until golden

Once golden, set aside to cool – this is your black pepper cheese crisp

### Step 4

Once the sausage meat has browned, add the sliced shallot and grated courgette to the pan with a small knob of butter

Cook for 5-6 min or until the veg has softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water

Reboil a kettle

Break the black pepper cheese crisp into shards – these are your peppery cheese shards

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 7

Once thickened, stir the drained gnocchi and refreshed peas through the sauce with a small splash of starchy cooking water – this is your creamy sausage & courgette gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the sausage & courgette gnocchi topped with the peppery cheese shards

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed
