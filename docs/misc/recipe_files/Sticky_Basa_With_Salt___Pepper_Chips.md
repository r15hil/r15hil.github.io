### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>sugar and lots of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the basa pieces to a bowl with your cornflour and give it a good mix up until coated all over

### Step 3

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated basa pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crispy and the fish is cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserving the pan

### Step 4

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small cubes

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the chopped pepper, chopped ginger and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your honey, chilli relish and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce

### Step 6

Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

Once thickened, add the crispy basa to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the fish is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky basa

### Step 7

Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray[s] and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips

### Step 8

Serve the sticky basa with the salt & pepper chips to the side

Enjoy!
