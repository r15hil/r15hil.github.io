### Step 1

Add the white long grain rice and 350ml<span class="text-danger"> [700ml]</span> cold water to a large pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down, reserve the pot

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your salt & pepper chips

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges then separate the wedges into petals

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and onion petals and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken has started to brown

Boil a kettle

### Step 5

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(no need to peel!)

Trim, then chop the green beans into bite-sized pieces

Once the chicken has browned, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter to the pan

Once the butter has melted, add the chopped green beans, grated carrot, curry powder and chopped ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further until fragrant

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1612880029231-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 3-4 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, dissolve the cornflour in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Add the cornflour mixture to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further until the sauce has thickened and the veg is tender – this is your Chinese-style chicken curry

### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the cooled rice, toasted sesame oil and remaining soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined

Push the rice to one side of the pot and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into the other side

Stir the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with a wooden spoon and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style chicken curry over the egg fried rice and salt & pepper chips

Enjoy!
