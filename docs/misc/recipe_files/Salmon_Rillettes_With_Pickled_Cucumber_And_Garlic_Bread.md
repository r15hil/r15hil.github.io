### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, remove 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter from the fridge to warm up for later

Zest your lemon[s] and cut into wedges

Chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives and lemon zest with your soured cream in a small bowl – this is your soured cream & chive dip

### Step 3

Add your salmon flakes to a medium bowl with half the soured cream & chive dip (you'll use the rest later) and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cover the salmon mixture with cling film and put it in the fridge to set before serving – this is your salmon rillettes

### Step 6

Slice your bread roll[s] into 3 slices per person

### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the salmon rillettes with the garlic bread, quick-pickled cucumber, chips and baby leaf salad to the side

Dollop the remaining soured cream & chive dip to the side and garnish with a lemon wedge

Drizzle a little olive oil over the baby leaf salad

Enjoy!
