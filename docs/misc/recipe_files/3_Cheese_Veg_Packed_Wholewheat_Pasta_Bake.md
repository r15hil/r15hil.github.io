## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your wholewheat tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the wholewheat tortiglioni

Re-boil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the pasta is cooking, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and cook for 4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, dried basil, balsamic vinegar, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 5

Once the courgette is beginning to soften, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock with the halved cherry tomatoes and chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min further


### Step 6

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain and tear your mozzarella into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the drained wholewheat tortiglioni to the sauce with the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and mix it up

Add half the pasta to an oven-proof dish, then top with the grated cheddar

Top with the remaining pasta, torn mozzarella and grated Italian hard cheese and put the tray in the oven for 5-10 min or until all the cheese has melted – this is your 3 cheese veg-packed pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve the 3 cheese veg-packed pasta bake topped with the reserved chopped basil and a grind of black pepper and enjoy!
