Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

### Step 2

Add the basmati rice, half the chopped creamed coconut and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a matching lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and leave covered until serving – this is your coconut rice

### Step 3

Combine the remaining chopped creamed coconut with 25ml<span class="text-danger"> [50ml] </span>boiled water and stir until a paste forms

Add the turmeric and half the tamari soy sauce (save the rest for later) and mix everything together – this is your coconut marinade

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper then cut the tofu into strips

Add the tofu strips to the coconut marinade and give everything a good mix up until the strips are coated

### Step 4

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens and set 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> aside

Discard the tough stalks, then layer the remaining leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Reboil a kettle

### Step 5

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle with the sliced garlic, chopped ginger, remaining tamari soy sauce and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the greens are tender

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Chop the coconut flakes roughly

Combine the sliced shallot, chopped tomato, coconut flakes, dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime in a small bowl

Season with a small pinch of salt and mix everything together – this is your sambal

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1629109127826-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinaded tofu strips and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp – this is your coconut tofu

While the tofu is cooking, bash the roasted peanuts in the bag with a rolling pin

Add the reserved spring green leaves to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Place the reserved spring green leaves on plates and add the coconut rice to the middle

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Surround the coconut rice with the coconut tofu, sambal, spring greens, crushed peanuts and lime wedges

Enjoy!
