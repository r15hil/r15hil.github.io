### Step 2

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and the smoked paprika then give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the wedges are golden and crispy – these are your smoky wedges

### Step 4

Add the beef mince to a bowl with generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly with clean hands for 1 min until fully combined (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, shape them into patties and refrigerate until later

Grate the cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later

### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat

Add the beef patties and cook for 5-6 min on one side, or until browned

Once browned, flip the patties and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Cover loosely with a lid (or some tin foil!) and cook for 2-3 min further or until the cheese has melted and the patties are cooked through

### Step 8

Drain the pickled shallots (discard the pickling liquid), then spread each brioche base with mayo and each brioche lid with chilli jam

To assemble, top the brioche base with the pickled shallots, some lettuce leaves, a cheesy patty, some peanut butter and a brioche lid

Serve with the smoky wedges to the side and enjoy!
