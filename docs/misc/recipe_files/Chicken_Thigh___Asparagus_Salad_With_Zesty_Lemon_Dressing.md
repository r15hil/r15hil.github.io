### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 3-4 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, trim the woody ends off your asparagus

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

### Step 5

After the chicken has had an initial 3-4 min, add the trimmed asparagus to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the asparagus is tender – this is your pan-fried chicken & asparagus

### Step 6

Cut the lemon[s] in half

Combine your mayo and your wholegrain mustard in a large bowl with the juice of half your lemon[s], a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your zesty dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1654011146422-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the pan-fried chicken & asparagus to the bowl with the zesty dressing along with the cooked potatoes and tomato wedges

Give everything a gentle mix – this is your chicken thigh & asparagus salad

### Step 8

Serve the chicken thigh & asparagus salad over the salad and drizzle over any remaining dressing

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
