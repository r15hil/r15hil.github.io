## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 1 courgette
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 6 Taste & Glory meat free sausages
- 120g couscous
- 30ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into bite-sized pieces

Cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters, keeping the skin on and root attached


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped veg and chopped garlic to a large bowl with a large drizzle of olive oil, season generously with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the seasoned veg to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


### Step 3

Add the meat-free sausages to the opposite side of the tray

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min until the sausages are golden and cooked through and the veg is starting to brown

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use to 2 trays!

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 4

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water in a small bowl

Add the couscous to the bowl, then cover and set aside for later


### Step 5

Add the balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-high heat

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for approx. 2-3 min or until it turns into a runny glaze that coats the back of a spoon

Tip: Watch the pan like a hawk to make sure the glaze doesn't burn!

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and set aside until serving – this is your balsamic glaze


### Step 6

Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork

Carefully remove the skin from the roasted onions by cutting the root end off and peeling off the skin, then separate the onion into petals

Chop the roasted pepper into small pieces


### Step 7

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Mix the roasted veg and chopped basil through the couscous – this is your roasted veg couscous

Drizzle with olive oil and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the cooked meat-free sausages over the roasted veg couscous

Spoon the balsamic glaze all over the meat-free sausages

Enjoy!
