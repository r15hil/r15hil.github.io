## Ingredients

- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Leek
- Parsley (5g)
- Dill (5g)
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once the leek has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs further, stirring to coat the leek in the flour

Add the vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add your crème fraîche and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened


### Step 5

Whilst the sauce is thickening, chop your parsley & dill finely, including the stalks

Cut your smoked basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped basa with most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish!)

Season with a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoked basa & leek mixture

Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish


### Step 7

Mash the drained potatoes roughly until lightly crushed, then drizzle with olive oil

Top the smoked basa & leek mixture with the crushed potato, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby smoked basa & leek pie

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the fish is cooked through and the pie is bubbling and golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Once done, remove the pie from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min (this helps the flavours develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the herby smoked basa & leek pie and garnish with the remaining chopped herbs

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
