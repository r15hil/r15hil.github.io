### Step 1

Boil a kettle and rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with your vegetable stock mix and plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot then cover with a lid until serving

### Step 2

While the brown rice is cooking, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your courgette[s] in half lengthways then scrape out the inner seeds using a teaspoon (you'll use these later!) – these are your courgette boats

Chop the inner seeds roughly

### Step 3

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Crumble your Greek cheese into small pieces

Combine the chopped courgette and chopped garlic in a bowl with the crumbled Greek cheese, honey, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and panko breadcrumbs

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek cheese stuffing

### Step 4

Transfer the courgette boats to a baking tray (or two!) and fill them with the Greek stuffing

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the courgette has softened and the Greek cheese stuffing is golden – this is your Greek cheese-stuffed courgette

### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your pistachio nuts and coriander seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer to a pestle & mortar

### Step 6

Add your ground turmeric and a pinch of salt to the pestle & mortar and grind to a fine crumb – this is your pistachio dukkah

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!

### Step 7

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely (discard the stems!)

Combine the chopped mint and natural yoghurt in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your mint yoghurt

Once the rice is cooked and drained, add your dried cranberries and a pinch of salt to the pan and stir it all together until fully combined – this is your fruity brown rice

### Step 8

Serve the fruity brown rice with the Greek cheese-stuffed courgette on top

Add a dollop of mint yoghurt to the side and sprinkle over the pistachio dukkah

Enjoy!
