- 5g parsley
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 250g cooked beetroot
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut the red onions into wedges

Drain the cooked beetroot and chop into quarters


### Step 2

Add the red onion wedges, chopped beetroot and butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving


### Step 4

While the quinoa is cooking, combine the balsamic vinegar and onion marmalade with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a large bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic onion dressing


### Step 5

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Crumble the Greek cheese into small pieces

Wash the lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the vegetables are roasted and tender, add the pumpkin seeds to the tray and cook for a further 2-5 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 7

Add the roasted vegetables, lamb's lettuce, toasted pumpkin seeds and half of the chopped parsley to a bowl with the cooked quinoa

Tumble it all together – this is your roasted vegetable & quinoa salad

### Step 8

Serve the roasted vegetable & quinoa salad topped with the crumbled Greek cheese

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle over the balsamic onion dressing

Enjoy!
