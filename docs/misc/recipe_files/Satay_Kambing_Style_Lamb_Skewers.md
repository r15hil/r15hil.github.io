## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your basmati rice with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Combine half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your marinade

Soak your skewers in cold water to prevent them from burning


### Step 3

Divide your lamb mince into 2 per person and press onto each skewer to form a long sausage shape – these are your lamb skewers


### Step 4

Add the lamb skewers to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Press the lamb to flatten it slightly and drizzle over the marinade (reserve the bowl!)

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!


### Step 5

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15 min, turning once, or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Kambing-style lamb skewers


### Step 6

Boil half a kettle

Combine your peanut butter and a small splash of boiled water in the reserved bowl and mix until well combined

Add the remaining soy sauce with the juice of half your lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!), your red Thai curry paste, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Season with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your satay sauce


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and separate the leaves

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the lettuce leaves and sliced tomato with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper and top with the Kambing-style lamb skewers

Serve the satay sauce and basmati rice to the side and garnish with a lime wedge

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
