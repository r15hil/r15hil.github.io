### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

### Step 2

Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped onion to the pan and cook for 5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further

### Step 4

### Step 5

Add your orzo to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the chicken stock and soft cheese and reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, stirring frequently for 12-15 min, or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Stirring the orzo will release the starch from the pasta, making it creamier!

### Step 6

Whilst everything is cooking, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper and chop it roughly

Tear your basil leaves

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 7

Add the chopped spinach, halved cherry tomatoes and grated cheese to the orzo with half the torn basil (save the rest for later!) and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, give everything a good mix up – this is one-pot creamy free range chicken thigh florentine

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot creamy free range chicken thigh florentine

Garnish with the remaining torn basil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!
