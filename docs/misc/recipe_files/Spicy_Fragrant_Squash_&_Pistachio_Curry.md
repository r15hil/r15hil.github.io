### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and chop your garlic and ginger

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Discard the outer green pods

### Step 3

Add the cardamom seeds to a food processor with your pistachios, cracked black pepper, chopped garlic and chopped ginger

Add most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your curry paste

Once the onion has softened, add the curry paste and your butternut squash cubes to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

While the onion and squash is cooking, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened and the vegetables are tender

### Step 6

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender and slightly charred – this is your roasted broccoli

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1678789030885-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the broccoli is cooking, trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once the butternut squash is tender, add the halved green beans and a pinch of salt to the curry with a splash of boiled water

Cook, covered, for a further 6-7 min or until the green beans are tender – this is your spicy fragrant squash & pistachio curry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy fragrant squash & pistachio curry over the basmati rice with the roasted broccoli to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining chopped coriander

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
