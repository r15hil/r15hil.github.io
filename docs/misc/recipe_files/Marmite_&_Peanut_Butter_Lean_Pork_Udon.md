### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 6-7 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, until starting to brown and crisp

Meanwhile, add half of your Marmite (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your red chilli relish, peanut butter and soy sauce and mix until combined – this is your Marmite satay sauce
