## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Peel your garlic


### Step 2

Add your parsley and coriander (including the stalks!) with the peeled garlic and juice of half your lemon[s] to a food processor

Add your ground cumin, ground paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 2 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [5 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: If you don’t have a food processor, use a pestle & mortar!

Blitz until smooth – this is your chermoula


### Step 3

Drain your king prawns, then add them to a bowl with the chermoula and give everything a good stir until the prawns are completely coated

Set aside to marinate

Roughly chop your sultanas

Add the chopped sultanas to a bowl, cover them with boiled water and set them aside to soak


### Step 4

Add your giant couscous to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the giant couscous for 8 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges and separate the wedges into petals

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion petals with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-8 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 6

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Drain the soaked sultanas

Add the onion petals (reserve the pan), grated carrot, drained sultanas, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the juice of half your lemon wedges to the drained couscous

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced giant couscous


### Step 7

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated prawns with all of the chermoula and cook for 6-7 min until the prawns are fragrant and cooked through – these are your chermoula king prawns

### Step 8

Serve the chermoula king prawns over the spiced giant couscous

Drizzle over any remaining chermoula and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
