## Ingredients

- British venison & pork burgers (2pcs)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Fig relish (25g)
- Ciabatta x2
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Rosemary & thyme (10g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Red onion
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Strip your rosemary and thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and the chopped herbs

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby fries

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 3

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Line a separate baking tray with tin foil

Add your venison & pork burger[s] to one side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your fig relish to the pan and stir until the onion is coated in the sticky relish

Reduce the heat to very low and cook until ready to serve, or until they have softened and caramelised – this is your figgy onion

Meanwhile, slice your Italian hard cheese finely


### Step 6

Once the venison & pork burger[s] have been cooking for 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and top with the sliced Italian hard cheese

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted, the burger is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the ciabatta is warm and crusty

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad in the balsamic dressing

### Step 8

Spread your mayo over each ciabatta base and lid

Layer on the cheesy burger, figgy onions and some dressed salad 

Serve the herby fries and remaining dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
