### Step 1

Preheat the grill to a high heat, then boil a kettle


Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the broccoli into quarters, lengthways


Cut each quarter again so that you end up with broccoli wedges, then add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess)


Drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Put the tray directly under the grill for 12-15 min or until softened and nicely charred

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly, then dissolve the coconut cream in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water&nbsp;&ndash; this is your coconut stock


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

### Step 5

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;pork&nbsp;and cook for 2 min, turning occasionally so that each side has been seared, then add&nbsp;a generous splash of water&nbsp;(to cover the base of the pan)


Cook, covered, for another 8-10 min, turning once half way, then transfer to a clean board and keep the pan


&nbsp;

### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the garlic,&nbsp;ginger&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;chilli flakes&nbsp;(can't handle the heat? Go easy!) &amp; cook for 30 sec, then add the&nbsp;coconut stock, peanut butter,&nbsp;soy sauce, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;&amp; the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime&nbsp;&amp; whisk until smooth


Cook for 3-4 min until thickened, then remove from the heat &ndash; this is your peanut sauce

### Step 7

Chop the&nbsp;coriander&nbsp;finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Stir most of the chopped&nbsp;coriander&nbsp;through the&nbsp;cooked rice (keep the rest for garnish) and season generously with&nbsp;salt&nbsp;&ndash; this is your coriander rice


Once rested, slice the curried&nbsp;pork&nbsp;finely and pour any&nbsp;resting juices&nbsp;and&nbsp;pan juices&nbsp;into the peanut sauce

### Step 8

Serve the sliced curried pork over the peanut sauce, with the coriander rice and charred broccoli to the side


Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Garnish with the remaining lime and coriander and enjoy!
