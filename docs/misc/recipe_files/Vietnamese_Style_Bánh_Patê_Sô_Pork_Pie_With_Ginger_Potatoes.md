## Ingredients

- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- Carrot & cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- British pork mince (125g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- British pork mince (250g)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Shallot
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and finely chop (save the leaves for later!)


### Step 2

Add your minced pork to a large bowl with the chopped shallot, chopped coriander stalks, half your ginger & garlic paste, half your soy sauce and half your rice vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!)

Add your chicken stock mix, cornflour and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!) and set aside – this is your pie filling


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to a large rectangle approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the pastry rectangle across the middle into long rectangles (1 per person!), then divide the pie filling into 1 square patty per person and add to one side of the pastry rectangle[s], leaving a small pastry border around each side of the filling

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)


### Step 4

Fold the pastry over the filling, leaving a small gap between the filling and the folded pastry, and press it together with your fingers to seal in the filling with as little air inside as possible, then transfer to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and brush with a little milk

Cut small air slits into the centre of the pies with a sharp knife and crimp the borders with a fork, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is until golden and cooked through – this is your Vietnamese bánh patê sô pork pie[s]


### Step 5

Boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and leave to steam dry in a colander and reserve the pot


### Step 6

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the reserved coriander leaves roughly

Combine your red chilli relish with the remaining soy sauce and a little of the remaining rice vinegar (save the rest for later!)

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your nuac cham dipping sauce


### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooked potatoes with the remaining ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until the potatoes are hot through – these are your ginger potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the Vietnamese bánh patê sô pork pie with the ginger potatoes, nuac cham dipping sauce and carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the side

Drizzle the carrot & cabbage slaw mix with the remaining rice vinegar and a little olive oil

Garnish with the chopped mint and coriander leaves

Enjoy!
