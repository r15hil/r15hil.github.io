## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and finely chop your carrot[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Once the onion and carrot are beginning to soften, add your lean beef mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min further or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

While the lean beef mince is cooking, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot until serving

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 6

Add the chopped garlic, tomato paste, stock, chopped tomatoes, dried basil and dried oregano to the pan

Season with a grind of black pepper, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lean beef bolognese


### Step 7

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Grate your Italian hard cheese

### Step 8

Serve the lean beef bolognese over the spaghetti

Top with the grated Italian hard cheese and chopped parsley and enjoy!
