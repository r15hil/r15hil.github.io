### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add a drizzle of vegetable oil, your smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

### Step 2

Drain and rinse your black beans

Add the drained black beans and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the beans are beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until it starts to crisp

Once crisp, add your panko breadcrumbs and cook for 2 min further – this is your chorizo crumb

### Step 4

While the chorizo is cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut 2 wedges per person

Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Combine half of the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with your mayo, a pinch of salt and splash of cold water in a small bowl – this is your garlic mayo

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining chopped garlic for another recipe!

Combine the drained sweetcorn, chopped cherry tomatoes, sliced spring onion and the juice of half your lime wedges<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a generous pinch of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil in a separate bowl – this is your corn salsa

### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 1-2 min, or until the tortillas are warmed through

### Step 7

Once the black beans are beginning to break down, remove them from the heat and mash them into a semi-smooth paste, then add a large knob of butter – these are your refried beans

Tip: If your beans are looking a little dry, add a splash of water

### Step 8

Top each warmed tortilla with the refried beans, corn salsa and chorizo crumb – these are your beany tacos

Drizzle with the garlic mayo and garnish with the remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!
