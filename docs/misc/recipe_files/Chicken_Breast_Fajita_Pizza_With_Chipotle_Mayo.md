### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then chop into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5-6 min

Once done, add the chopped pepper and sliced shallot and cook for 5-6 min further or until the chicken is golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy chicken & pepper mixture

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce

### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the tomato sauce between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over with the back of a spoon

Top with the spicy chicken & pepper mixture

### Step 6

Sprinkle the pizza[s] with the grated cheese then top with the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the cheese has melted and the base[s] is crisp – this is your chicken fajita pizza

### Step 8

Serve the chicken fajita pizza with the chipotle mayo to the side

Enjoy!
