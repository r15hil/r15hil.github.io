### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and grate the garlic

Combine the meat-free mince with half of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined

### Step 2

Divide the meat-free mince into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and shape into meatballs

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add the meat-free meatballs to the pan and cook for<span class="text-danger"> </span>6-7 min, turning frequently, until they're browned on all sides

Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan for later (these will finish cooking in the oven later)

### Step 3

While the meat-free meatballs are browning, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the diced red onion and remaining grated garlic and cook for 6-7 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

### Step 4

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the dried oregano and tomato paste and cook for 1 min

Add the chopped tomato, vegetable stock and half of the balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add half of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and a very generous crack of black pepper

Roughly break the spaghetti up into thirds, add it to the pan and mix everything together – this is your tomato & basil sauce

### Step 6

Add the tomato & basil sauce to an oven-proof dish with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and press down on the broken spaghetti so that it's submerged in the sauce

Place the meat-free meatballs on top and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min – this is your spaghetti & meat-free meatball bake

While the meatballs are cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1633956320398-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Remove the dish from the oven after 20 min and top with the grated cheese

Return the cheesy spaghetti & meat-free meatball bake to the oven and cook for a final 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, the remaining balsamic vinegar and a crack of black pepper

### Step 8

Set the cheesy spaghetti & meat-free meatball bake in the centre of the table, ready to share

Serve the balsamic salad in a bowl to the side and garnish with the remaining basil

Enjoy!
