## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240&ordm;C/ 220&ordm;C (fan)/ 475&ordm;F/ Gas 9


Chop the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges and pierce&nbsp;each wedge with a fork a few times, then wrap the garlic cloves (skins on) in tin foil


Add the pierced aubergine wedges and wrapped&nbsp;garlic cloves&nbsp;to a baking tray, then put the tray in the oven and cook for 30-35 min or until the aubergine is soft and brown


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skins on) into wedges


Add the&nbsp;lamb mince, panko&nbsp;breadcrumbs and ground cumin to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Mix thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined, then shape into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]&nbsp;</span>koftes


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Add the red onion wedges to one half of a separate tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;


Add the lamb koftes to the other half of the tray


Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min until the onions are tender and the kofte are&nbsp;browned and cooked through


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half&nbsp;


Squeeze the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon into a large bowl


Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix to combine


Wash, then add the baby leaf spinach&nbsp;to the bowl and give it a gentle mix up until coated in the dressing


### Step 5

Once the aubergine and garlic has softened, transfer to a clean chopping board (reserve the tray) and allow to cool slightly


Meanwhile, squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon into a small bowl


Add the tahini, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Add the pitta bread to&nbsp;the reserved baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


Once cool enough to handle, scoop the soft aubergine flesh out of the skin with a spoon


Squeeze the soft roasted garlic out of&nbsp;its skin&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Add the garlic and aubergine&nbsp;flesh to the&nbsp;tahini bowl&nbsp;and give everything a good mix up &ndash; this is your baba ganoush&nbsp;

### Step 8

Once the red onions are done, carefully cut off the root and remove the skins


Serve the lamb kofte over the baba ganoush with the roasted onion petals,&nbsp;dressed spinach&nbsp;and warmed pitta to the side


Sprinkle the baba ganoush with a pinch of cayenne pepper (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) <span class="text-highlight">and enjoy!</span>
