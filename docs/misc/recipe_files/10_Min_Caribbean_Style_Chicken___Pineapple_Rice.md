### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast strips, a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 7-8 min, turning halfway, or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

Heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed basmati rice to separate the grains

Add the rice, drained beans and a splash of water and cook for 4 min, stirring regularly, or until warmed through

Once hot, add pineapple chunks

Once the chicken is almost cooked, add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice, soy sauce and a splash of pineapple juice to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce starts to thicken slightly – this is your Caribbean-style chicken
