### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash, then cut your lettuce into thin wedges, lengthways, and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until they've softened slightly

Boil a kettle

Coat your chicken breast portion[s] in your curry powder

Once softened, transfer the pepper and onion to a clean plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat (no need to clean!)
