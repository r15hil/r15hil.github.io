## Ingredients

- 160g trimmed fine green beans
- 11g beef stock mix 
- 6 pigs in blankets
- 4 white potatoes
- 2 carrots
- 1 fig relish pot (25g)
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Top, tail and slice the carrots at an angle

Add the carrots to a baking tray, drizzle them with olive oil and season them with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the pigs in blankets to the tray and put everything in the oven for 20 min or until the sausages are cooked through


### Step 2

While the carrots and sausages are cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a very low heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Tip: If you'd rather skin-off mash, peel the potatoes first

Add the potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

Re-boil a kettle

Dissolve the Kallo beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water, add the fig relish and mix until fully combined – this is your figgy stock


### Step 5

Once caramelised, add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>flour to the onion and cook for 1 min, stirring until they're evenly coated in the flour

Add the figgy stock, increase the heat to medium and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your figgy gravy


### Step 6

While the gravy thickens, add the green beans to a pot with plenty of boiling water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 7

While your green beans are boiling, return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Serve the pigs in blankets over the mash with the carrots and green beans to the side

Pour the figgy gravy all over and enjoy!
