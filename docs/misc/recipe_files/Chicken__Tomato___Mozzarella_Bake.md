## Ingredients

- 120g fine green beans
- 1 tsp Italian dried oregano
- 1 chicken stock cube 
- 2 tbsp rich tomato paste
- 4 British chicken thigh fillets 
- 300g new potatoes
- 125g fresh mozzarella 
- 1 tbsp Henderson's relish 
- 2 garlic cloves 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Slice the potatoes into discs and add to&nbsp;a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, season&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and pepper and put them oven for 20-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a high heat


Season the chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper


Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 3 min, turning halfway until just golden, then&nbsp;transfer to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Dissolve half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the stock cube in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water &nbsp;


Return the pan to a medium heat, with a drizzle of olive oil&nbsp;


Add&nbsp;the garlic and cook for 1 min, then add the stock, tomato paste, Henderson's relish and oregano (save a pinch for step 7)


### Step 4

Cook for 3-6 min or until the liquid has reduced to a soup-like consistency


Once&nbsp;reduced, pour the sauce into a casserole dish (or a suitably deep oven-proof dish) and place the chicken thighs on top, reserving the pan for later


Put&nbsp;the dish in the oven for 15 min&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, pat the mozzarella ball<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> dry and cut into slices&nbsp;


Trim the green beans and cut them into bite-size pieces (little hands can do this with scissors!)


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return&nbsp;it to a medium heat, with a knob of butter


Once hot, add the green beans with a splash of water and cook, covered, for 5 min or until cooked through&nbsp;


### Step 7

Once the chicken has had 15 min oven-time, remove the dish from the oven and place the mozzarella slices over each piece of chicken


Sprinkle the remaining oregano over the mozzarella slices


Put the dish back into the oven for 5 min or until the mozzarella has melted and the chicken is cooked through

### Step 8

Serve the melty mozzarella chicken with the crispy potatoes and green beans to the side


Enjoy!
