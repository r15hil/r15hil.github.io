### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add your curry powder, ground turmeric and ground coriander and cook for 30 secs further or until fragrant

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the mackerel pieces and chopped spinach to the pan with the cooked rice, vegetable stock and a pinch of salt and pepper

Increase the heat to high and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until everything has warmed through and the spinach has wilted

Add the juice of half your lemon wedges – this is your kedgeree-style smoked mackerel & spinach rice
