## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chop into quarters

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin


### Step 3

Add the onion quarters and crushed garlic to the pan

Tear in your chestnut mushrooms and flat white mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until the mushrooms are starting to soften


### Step 4

Add your tomato paste to the dish with your ground smoked paprika, vegetable stock mix, soy sauce, umami seasoning, Dijon mustard and Henderson's Relish

Stir it all together


### Step 5

Add your tortiglioni to the dish with 450ml<span class="text-purple"> [600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 6

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After an initial 15 min, remove the dish from the oven, give everything a good mix up and return, covered, for a final 10-15 min or until the pasta is cooked through

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and stir through the spinach and most of your soured cream (save some for dolloping!)

Leave to stand with the lid on for 5 minutes or until the spinach has wilted – this is your one-pot baked mushroom stroganoff tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot baked mushroom stroganoff tortiglioni 

Top with the remaining soured cream and season with a generous pinch of pepper

Dig in!
