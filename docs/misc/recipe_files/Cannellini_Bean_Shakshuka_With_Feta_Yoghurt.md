### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion petals and pepper strips with a pinch of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 4

Once the pepper and onion have softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground smoked paprika and drained cannellini beans and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until the vegetables are tender and the stock has thickened to a stew-like consistency

### Step 5

Meanwhile, crumble your feta into small bite-sized pieces

Add the crumbled feta to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and a grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your feta yoghurt

### Step 6

Once thickened, make 1 well per person in the pan, then crack your egg[s] into the well[s] and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your cannellini bean shakshuka

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, slice the toasted ciabatta halves on the diagonal

### Step 8

Serve the cannellini bean shakshuka with the feta yoghurt and toasted ciabatta[s] to the side

Garnish with your pumpkin seeds, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
