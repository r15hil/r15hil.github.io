## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 2 plain naans
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 20g harissa paste
- 30g feta 
- 2 carrots
- 300g portobello mushrooms
- 1/2 cucumber
- 50g rocket
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 skewers

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Drizzle olive oil over both sides of the portobello mushrooms and add them to the pan

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 2

Cover the mushrooms with a smaller, heavy-based pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, turn the mushrooms so they are stem-side up and add a heavy weight (e.g. several cans) to the pan on top

Cook for 4-5 min further or until most of the moisture has been released

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside


### Step 3

While the mushrooms are cooking, top, tail, and chop the carrots in half lengthways, then into batons

Add the carrot batons to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, half the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper

Give everything a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and beginning to crisp – these are your harissa roasted carrots


### Step 4

Crumble the feta into a small bowl and add the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Combine the ground cumin, cinnamon, paprika and dried oregano on a small plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your shawarma seasoning


### Step 5

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber 'ribbons'

Peel and finely chop the garlic

Combine the natural yoghurt with the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic yoghurt


### Step 6

Transfer the pressed mushrooms to a chopping board and reserve the pan

Rub the shawarma seasoning into both sides of the mushrooms (be careful – they may still be hot!)

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Cook the seasoned mushrooms for 3-4 min or until beginning to blacken – these are your shawarma mushrooms


### Step 7

Add the naans to the oven for 2-3 min or until hot

Slice the shawarma mushrooms thinly using a sharp knife

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Spread the garlic yoghurt over the warmed naan and pile on the sliced shawarma mushrooms, cucumber ribbons, harissa feta and some rocket , then use a skewer to hold everything together

Serve the remaining rocket and the harissa roasted carrots to the side

Enjoy!
