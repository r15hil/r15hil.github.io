Once the tagliatelle is cooked, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs or until it starts to sizzle slightly

Add the torn smoked mackerel and cook for 1 min further

### Step 6

Add the drained tagliatelle and a few splashes of the reserved starchy pasta water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper then increase the heat to high

Add the soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min, stirring until everything is combined and the sauce begins to stick to the pasta

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 7

Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon and add half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later) with half the chopped dill & chives (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and season with a generous grind of pepper – this is your smoked mackerel tagliatelle

### Step 8

Serve the smoked mackerel tagliatelle with the zingy salad to the side

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and reserved chopped dill & chives all over and then season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
