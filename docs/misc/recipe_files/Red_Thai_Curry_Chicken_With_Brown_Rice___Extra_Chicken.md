## Ingredients

- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Gluten free soy sauce (15ml)
- British chicken breast portion
- Red Thai curry paste (20g) x0
- Cooked brown long grain rice (280g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Red Thai curry paste (40g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Spinach (80g)
- Roasted peanuts (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Add your chicken breast portions to a chopping board

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the flattened chicken to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side (no pink meat!)

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, trim your green beans

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Wash your spinach and shake off any excess water


### Step 4

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the green beans to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until lightly charred


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut finely

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Add your red Thai curry paste and half your gluten free soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!) with a pinch of sugar and stir it all together – this is your red Thai curry stock

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains


### Step 6

Once the green beans are lightly charred, remove the pan from the heat and add your cooked brown long grain rice and the spinach

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a splash of cold water and cook for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until the rice is warmed through and the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, add the remaining gluten free soy sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your brown rice & greens


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a plate and remove the pan from the heat (reserve the pan!)

Add the red Thai curry stock to the reserved pan

Tip: Be careful when adding the stock to the pan, it may splash!

Return the pan to a medium heat and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your red Thai curry sauce

### Step 8

Slice the chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced chicken with the brown rice & greens to the side

Drizzle the red Thai curry sauce over the chicken and top with the chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
