## Ingredients

- Cheddar cheese (40g) x2
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Curry powder (1tbsp)
- British skinless chicken thighs (160g) x0
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Plain naan (2pcs)
- Green chilli
- British skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Spinach (80g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick slices


### Step 2

Combine your ground smoked paprika and curry powder with half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest for later!) in a medium bowl

Add the chicken thighs and sliced pepper to the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Add the coated chicken thighs and pepper to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until the pepper is slightly charred and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) - this is your tandoori chicken thighs


### Step 4

While the chicken is in the oven, cut your green chilli[es] in quarters lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 5

Grate your cheddar cheese, using the fine side of the grater


### Step 6

Once the tandoori chicken is cooked, remove the baking tray from the oven

Transfer the tandoori chicken thighs to a clean board, reserving the tray

Re-line the reserved baking tray with baking paper

Add your naan[s] to the baking tray and top with the grated cheddar, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and charred pepper


### Step 7

Put the tray in the oven for 4 min or until the bread is warmed through and the cheese has melted – this is your chilli-cheese naan

Meanwhile, on a clean board shred the tandoori chicken apart using two forks – this is your pulled tandoori chicken

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chilli-cheese naan with the spinach and pulled tandoori chicken thigh layered on top  – this is your chilli-cheese naan with tandoori chicken

Drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
