# Greek Chicken Gyros, Chips & Salad

## Description

Gyros (pronounced yee-ros) is the ultimate Greek street food. Chicken is cooked on a vertical rotisserie and served in flatbread. You'll replicate this little technique with a hack that involves rolling the chicken breast into a tight cigar-shape, so you're still left with a juicy and flavourful meat. Served with tzatziki, salad and chips.

## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 tomato
- 4 wholemeal pittas
- 1 tbsp Italian dried oregano
- 150g organic Greek-style yoghurt
- 300g potatoes
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Place your hand flat onto the&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces of&nbsp;chicken


Lay a sheet of cling film or greaseproof paper over the&nbsp;chicken breast&nbsp;halves&nbsp;and bash the chicken with a rolling pin to an even thickness throughout&nbsp;


### Step 2

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Combine half of the Greek-style yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!), dried oregano and the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon in a large bowl with a large drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Add the chicken and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Add the chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and roll each flattened piece up tightly to form a cigar shape&nbsp;


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through - this is your chicken gyros&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips


Add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt


Put the baking tray in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until they're golden and crispy


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the cucumber in half, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and throw the watery seeds away - grate the remaining&nbsp;cucumber


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Cut the remaining lemon into&nbsp;wedges


### Step 6

Combine the remaining Greek-style yoghurt with the grated cucumber and&nbsp;chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and the juice of 1<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper - this is your tzatziki&nbsp;


### Step 7

Cut&nbsp;4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>&nbsp;thin slices from the beef tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>&nbsp;


Chop the remaining beef tomato roughly


Separate the outer gem lettuce leaves and chop the inner core roughly


Combine the chopped beef tomato and&nbsp;inner gem lettuce&nbsp;core with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl


Pop the wholemeal pittas in the oven for 1-2 min or until they're warmed through

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken gyros into thin slices, then carefully cut the warm&nbsp;pittas&nbsp;down the seam to open up the pocket (don't cut all the way through!)


Fill each pitta with some of the tzatziki, gem lettuce leaves, sliced&nbsp;beef tomato and the sliced chicken gyros


Serve with the chips, tomato,&nbsp;lettuce salad and the remaining tzatziki and enjoy!
