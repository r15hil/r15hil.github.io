## Ingredients

- Tomato
- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Green pepper
- Rocket (50g)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano all over, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the onion wedges and tomato wedges to one side of a separate baking tray and set aside for later


### Step 3

Add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together, then add your free range chicken thighs and turn them several times until they're fully coated in all the spices – this is your paprika chicken


### Step 4

Add the paprika chicken to the tray with the onion and tomato and drizzle everything with olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables have softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli


### Step 6

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – this is your charred pepper


### Step 7

Transfer the cooked paprika chicken to a clean board and slice finely

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the sliced paprika chicken with the charred pepper, crispy potatoes, roasted onion and tomato over the salad – this is your Spanish-style free range chicken & charred pepper salad

Drizzle the spicy aioli all over

Enjoy!
