## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Cornflour (1tsp) x0
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Coriander (5g)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Green chilli
- Tomato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped tomato, diced shallot and chopped coriander to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your tomato salsa


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Add your beef mince to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patty hold its shape whilst cooking)

Divide and shape the mince into 1 thin patty per person – this is your burger patty[ies]


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Slice your green chilli[es] into rounds

Combine the chilli rounds with your white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your quick-pickled chilli


### Step 5

Combine the grated cheese with your cornflour in a pot and mix until the cheese is coated in the flour

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk to the pot with your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook over a medium heat for 2-3 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your nacho cheese sauce


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add your brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving, reserving the pan


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the burger patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)

### Step 8

Fill your toasted brioche bun with your cooked burger patty, a spoonful of the nacho cheese sauce, some of the tomato salsa and the quick-pickled green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the chips to the side with any remaining tomato salsa and nacho cheese sauce

Enjoy!
