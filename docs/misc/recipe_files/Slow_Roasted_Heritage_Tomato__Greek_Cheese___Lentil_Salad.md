### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 160°C/ 140°C (fan)/ gas 3

Chop your heritage tomatoes and cherry tomatoes in half

Add the halved tomatoes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened – these are your slow-roasted tomatoes

Meanwhile, crumble your Greek cheese onto one side of a separate baking tray and add your pine nut & seed mix (leave some space on the tray for later!)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 4

While the Greek cheese and pine nuts & seeds are baking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

In a large bowl, combine the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic?

### Step 6

Once the Greek cheese has been in the oven for 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the ciabatta slices to the other side of the tray

Drizzle the ciabatta slices with olive oil and season them with a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for a further 5 min or until lightly crisped


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the drained green lentils and salad to the bowl of balsamic vinaigrette and give everything a good mix up – this is your lentil salad

### Step 8

Divide the lentil salad between bowls, top with the slow-roasted tomatoes, baked Greek cheese and toasted pine nut & seed mix

Serve the crispy ciabatta slices to the side and garnish with the chopped basil

Enjoy!
