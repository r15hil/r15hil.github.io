### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into 4 rounds per person

Chop your peppers into large chunks (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then peel and cut your red onion[s] into large wedges

### Step 2

Add the chopped veg to a large bowl, drizzle with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and season with a pinch of pepper

Add your curry powder to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated veg

### Step 3

Thread the coated veg onto the soaked skewers, alternating as you go

Add the veg skewers (and any remaining veg) to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until everything has browned and is starting to char - these are your roasted veg skewers

### Step 4

Whilst the veg is cooking, add the white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low, and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Boil half a kettle

### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut with your peanut butter in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your peanut stock

Add the peanut stock to a small pot with your agave, soy sauce and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) then bring to the boil over a medium-high heat

### Step 6

Cook for 2-4 min or until the sauce has reduced by half and thickened – this is your satay sauce

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/688.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, fluff with a fork and stir the chopped coriander through with a pinch of salt – this is your coriander rice

### Step 8

Serve the roasted veg skewers over the coriander rice

Drizzle the satay sauce over the skewers and serve any remaining satay sauce on the side for dipping

Enjoy!
