### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife, remove the skin<span class="text-danger"> </span>and roughly chop

Chop your basil stalks and your basil leaves roughly, keeping them separate

### Step 4

Once hot, add your ‘Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped pepper, chopped basil stalks and chopped garlic to the dish with a pinch of pepper

Add your orzo, tomato paste, chicken stock mix, creamy single soy and 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

### Step 5

Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the orzo is tender – this is your one pot spicy 'Nduja & pepper orzo

### Step 6

Add your cherry tomatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 22-25 min or until the tomatoes are soft and slightly charred – these are your roasted tomatoes

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Combine your Dijon mustard and juice of half your lemon[s] in a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Wash your salad, pat it dry with kitchen paper and add to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

To serve, give the one pot spicy ‘Nduja & pepper orzo a good mix up, top with the roasted tomatoes and serve the dressed salad to the side

Tip: Add a splash of water if the orzo is looking a little dry

Garnish with the chopped basil leaves and a lemon wedge

Dig in!
