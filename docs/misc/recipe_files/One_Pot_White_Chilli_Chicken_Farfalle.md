Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your farfalle with your chicken stock mix and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1L] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Increase the heat to high and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 14-16 min, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it from sticking!

Top with the remaining grated cheese (don't mix!), sliced green chilli and your smoked salt

Set aside, covered, for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your one pot white chilli chicken farfalle
