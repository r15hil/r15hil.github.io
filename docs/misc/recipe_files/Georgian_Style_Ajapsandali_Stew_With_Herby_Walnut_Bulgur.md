### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into large, bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

### Step 2

Add the chopped aubergine and diced pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until tender – this is your roasted veg

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

### Step 3

Whilst the veg is cooking, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your ground coriander and chopped tomatoes

Cook for 2-3 min or until the tomato is beginning to soften

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 6

Once the tomato has softened, add the tomato stock to the pan with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar, the roasted veg and a generous grind of black pepper, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened – this is your Georgian-style ajapsandali stew

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1700569734497-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whilst the stew is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Crush your walnuts in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don’t lose any!)

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

Mix the chopped coriander and crushed walnuts through the cooked bulgur with a pinch of salt – this is your herby walnut bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the Georgian-style ajapsandali stew over the herby walnut bulgur

Crumble your feta over the top and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
