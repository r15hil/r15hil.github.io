Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

### Step 3

Add the basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated steaks (save the extra marinade for later!) to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side

For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

### Step 5

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways and season with a pinch of salt

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 6

Once the steaks are done, transfer them to a plate and set them aside to rest

Return the pan to a medium heat, add the remaining marinade and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened slightly – this is your carne asada sauce

### Step 7

Slice the rested steaks finely – this is your carne asada steak

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the carne asada steak over the cooked rice and drizzle with the carne asada sauce

Top with the pickled red cabbage, sliced avocado, crumble over the feta cheese and garnish with the chopped coriander and a wedge of lime

Enjoy!
