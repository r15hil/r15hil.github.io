## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and slice 1/4 of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>red onion[s] as finely as you can and add it to a small bowl

Dice the remaining onion and tomato[es] finely

Add you diced tomato to the bowl with the sliced onion with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato salad


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Once the meat-free mince is browned, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and curry powder and cook for 3-4 min further or until cooked through and fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything finely!

Grind to a fine paste, then add your mayo with a squeeze of<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon juice

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir it all together – this is your coriander chutney


### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min, or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the meat-free mince is done, add a squeeze of lemon juice and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> water and give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced meat-free mince

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Fill the warmed tortillas with the shredded lettuce, spiced meat-free mince and tomato salad

Drizzle the coriander chutney all over and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and lemon wedge[s]

Enjoy!
