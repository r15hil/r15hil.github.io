### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a large heat-proof bowl covered with cling film

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until slightly tender

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds and finely dice the remaining chilli[es]

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Combine the juice of half the lime and 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar with the chilli rounds and sliced shallot – this is your quick-pickled chilli

### Step 3

Once the potatoes are slightly tender, transfer them to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min

### Step 4

Cut your cucumber into thin batons, then dice finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks (save some leaves for a garnish!)

### Step 5

Combine your crab meat with the diced cucumber, chopped tomato and chopped coriander

Add the diced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), and a generous squeeze of lime juice

Add your mayo with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your crab aguachile

### Step 6

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, add the sliced ciabatta to the tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 8-10 min or until golden

### Step 7

Once everything is ready, top the toasted ciabatta with the crab aguachile – these are your crab aguachile-style toasts

### Step 8

Serve the crab aguachile-style toasts garnished with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Serve the roast potatoes to the side topped with the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
