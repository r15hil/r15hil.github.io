## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layers of the lemongrass and set aside for later, then chop the softer inner core[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice, the outer lemongrass layers to a pot with a lid with a pinch of salt, the chopped creamed coconut and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and discard the outer lemongrass layers – this is your coconut rice


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, add the inner lemongrass core and curry powder to a bowl with your ginger & garlic paste, ground turmeric, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Add the free range chicken thighs to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken


### Step 4

Add your cornflour to the marinated chicken and mix it all together until the chicken is completed coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 10 min on each side or until the chicken is crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Malaysian-style free range fried chicken


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix with half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of sugar and salt and mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled slaw


### Step 7

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> hot water and mix it all together until the sugar has dissolved

Add the remaining rice vinegar and tamarind paste to the bowl with your soy sauce and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli tamarind sauce

### Step 8

Serve the Malaysian-style fried free range chicken with the coconut rice and quick-pickled slaw to the side

Serve the chilli tamarind sauce to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
