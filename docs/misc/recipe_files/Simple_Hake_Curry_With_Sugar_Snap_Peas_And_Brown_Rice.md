## Ingredients

- Garam masala (1tsp)
- Red chilli
- Tomato x2
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Brown basmati rice (100g)
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Sugar snap peas (80g)
- Garlic clove
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Lime
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger, then peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Separate your coriander leaves from the stalks, then chop them both finely


### Step 3

Add the chopped ginger, garlic, tomatoes, chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and coriander stalks (save the leaves for garnish!) to a food processor

Add a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your curry paste


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until softened


### Step 5

Whilst the onion is softening, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and add your soy sauce – this is your coconut stock

Once the onion has softened, add your garam masala and ground cumin and cook for a further 1 min

Add your curry paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Add the coconut stock and cook for 3-5 min or until reduced to a curry-like consistency

Meanwhile, chop your hake fillet[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Once the sauce has thickened, add the chopped hake and your sugar snap peas to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 7

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the hake is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Remove the pan from the heat and squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your simple hake curry with sugar snap peas

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the simple hake curry with sugar snap peas with the brown rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
