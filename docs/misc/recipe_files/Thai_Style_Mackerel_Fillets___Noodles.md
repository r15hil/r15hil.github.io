- 1 bag of roasted peanuts
- 1 red chilli
- 1 carrot 
- 25g Thai spice jelly
- 2 mackerel fillets
- 2 wholewheat noodle nests
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 2 soy sauce sachets (16ml) 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


<span style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged</span>


<span style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7min until tender with a slight bite</span>


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the&nbsp;ginger


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;


Slice the white parts of the pak choi, keeping the green leaves whole


Cut 2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Add the sheets of baking paper to a large baking tray&nbsp;


Add the white parts of the pak choi&nbsp;&nbsp;(reserve the green leaves), fish sauce,&nbsp;chopped garlic, ginger, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt to the baking paper


Give everything a good old mix up&nbsp;


Top with the&nbsp;mackerel fillets, skin-side up


Season the mackerel fillets with a pinch of salt


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Scrunch the edges of the&nbsp;baking paper&nbsp;together around the pak&nbsp;choi and mackerel&nbsp;fillets to form a sealed parcel


Put the baking tray in the oven for 15 min or until the mackerel&nbsp;is cooked


Tip: your mackerel is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Meanwhile, once done, add the green pak choi leaves to the noodles and cook for 30 sec further


Drain the&nbsp;noodles&nbsp;and pak&nbsp;choi&nbsp;and set aside


### Step 6

Meanwhile, bash the peanuts with a rolling pin until finely crushed (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)


Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Cut the red&nbsp;chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed and chop Ô¨Ånely


Trim the spring onions and slice them lengthways until you have thin strips


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Combine the Thai spice jelly and&nbsp;soy sauce&nbsp;with the chopped chilli (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) &ndash; this is your Thai dressing


Once done, remove the sealed parcel from the oven and carefully set the mackerel&nbsp;fillets aside


Add the drained noodles, Thai dressing, carrot ribbons and spring onion strips to the roasted pak&nbsp;choi&nbsp;and give everything a good mix up&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the mackerel fillets, skin-side up,&nbsp;over the Thai noodle salad


Garnish with the bashed peanuts


Enjoy!
