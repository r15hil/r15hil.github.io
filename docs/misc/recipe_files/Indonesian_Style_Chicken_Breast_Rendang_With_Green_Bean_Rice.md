## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Trim, then cut your green beans in half


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the halved green beans

Cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice


### Step 3

While the rice and beans are cooking, peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green skins

Grind the chopped garlic, cardamom seeds, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!), ginger paste and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a coarse paste – this is your spice paste


### Step 4

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and spice paste to a bowl and mix thoroughly – this is your coated chicken

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until nicely browned


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water then add your fish sauce – this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Flip the chicken, then add the coconut stock to the pan

Cook, uncovered, for a further 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), the liquid has evaporated, and the sauce has thickened – this is your Indonesian-style chicken breast rendang


### Step 7

Fluff the green bean rice with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the Indonesian-style chicken breast rendang over the green bean rice

Enjoy!
