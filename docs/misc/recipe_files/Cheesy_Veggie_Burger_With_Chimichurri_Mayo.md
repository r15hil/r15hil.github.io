### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and slice half your red onion[s] thin rings (you'll use the rest later!)

Add the onion rings to a shallow bowl with your red wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion

### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until crispy and golden

### Step 3

While the chips are cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your mint finely, discard the stalks

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your red chilli[es] finely

### Step 4

Grate the remaining red onion

Add the grated red onion and your meat-free burger patty[ies] to a large bowl with a generous grind of pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands in the best way!), then shape into 1 patty per person

Add the meat-free burger patty[ies] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

### Step 5

While the meat-free patty[ies] is cooking, add the chopped parsley and mint, a pinch of salt and a small splash of cold water to a pestle & mortar and grind to a paste (alternatively you can pulse them in a food processor!)

Add your mayo, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled red onion – this is your chimichurri mayo

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1630493635440-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) (or griddle if you have one), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Grate your cheddar cheese

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1630493639595-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the meat-free patty[ies] is cooked, remove the tray from the oven and top with the grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy meat-free patty

While the cheese is melting, separate your lettuce into leaves, then wash them thoroughly and pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To build, top your toasted brioche base with a few lettuce leaves, a cheesy meat-free patty, some quick-pickled red onion, a dollop of chimichurri mayo and the toasted brioche lid – this is your cheesy veggie burger

Serve the chips to the side with any remaining chimichurri mayo and remaining lettuce leaves

Top the lettuce leaves with any remaining quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!
