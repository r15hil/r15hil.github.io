## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Peel and chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Peel and roughly chop your garlic


### Step 2

Add the onion wedges and garlic to a food processor with half the green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Blitz until finely chopped – this is your curry base

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the curry base with your ground turmeric, curry powder and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the chopped aubergine and halved green beans to the pan

Mix everything together and cook for 1-2 min until the spices have coated the vegetables


### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[595ml] </span>boiled water to the pan with the chopped creamed coconut, tamarind paste, vegetable stock mix and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 6

Add the drained chickpeas to the pan then cook, covered, for 5 min or until the aubergine is cooked through – this is your coconutty tamarind aubergine & green bean curry


### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice the remaining green chilli finely

Crush your cashew nuts in their bag with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

### Step 8

Serve the coconutty tamarind aubergine & green bean curry and top with the crushed cashew nuts and sliced green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
