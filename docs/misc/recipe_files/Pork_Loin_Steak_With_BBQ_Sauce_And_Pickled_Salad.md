### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9, then take your steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thick discs

### Step 2

Add the potato discs to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – these are your smoky potatoes

### Step 3

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and slice your shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin discs

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop into thick slices, then cut your cucumber in half lengthways and slice finely

Add the shallot discs to a medium bowl with your red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt

Mix everything together and set aside until later – these are your quick-pickled shallots

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat, and once hot, add the steaks and cook for an initial 3-4 min on each side or until browned

Meanwhile, combine the remaining ground smoked paprika with your tomato ketchup, your wholegrain mustard, honey, Henderson's Relish and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> cold water – this is your barbecue sauce

### Step 6

Once browned, pour the barbecue sauce over the steaks, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for a final 2-3 min or until the steaks are cooked through and the sauce has slightly thickened (no pink meat!) – these are your BBQ pork steaks

Transfer the BBQ pork steaks to a clean board and leave to rest for 2 min

### Step 7

Whilst the steaks are resting, add the chopped lettuce and sliced cucumber to the bowl with the quick-pickled shallots

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper and toss together – this is your pickled salad

### Step 8

Serve the rested BBQ pork steaks with the smoky potatoes and pickled salad to the side

Drizzle any remaining BBQ sauce over the potatoes

Enjoy!
