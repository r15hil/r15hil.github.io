Score the flesh quite deeply (in a criss-cross pattern) taking care not the cut the skin&nbsp;


### Step 2

Combine the harissa paste, honey, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;lemon&nbsp;juice and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water - this is your harissa glaze


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the bulgur&nbsp;to a pot of plenty of salted boiled water


Cook for 10-18 min or until the bulgur is tender with a slight bite&nbsp;


Once cooked, drain and set aside to cool slightly&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the&nbsp;aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>to a baking tray, cut-side up (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Spoon 3/4 of the harissa glaze over the cut side of the aubergines


Put the baking tray in the oven for 15 min


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


Strip the mint leaves from the stems and chop the leaves finely, discarding the stems&nbsp;


Trim, then slice the spring onions finely


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Once the bulgur has cooled slightly, add the chopped mint, parsley&nbsp;and spring onions


Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Squeeze in 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> lemon juice and stir to combine - this is your herby tabbouleh&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Once they've had 15 min, spoon the remaining glaze over the aubergine halves and return them to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until the aubergine&nbsp;is soft and the glaze is sticky


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the harissa-glazed aubergine over the herby tabbouleh&nbsp;
