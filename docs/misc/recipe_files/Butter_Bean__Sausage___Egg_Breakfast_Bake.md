## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 0 butter beans
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 400g canned butter beans
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1 ciabatta
- 4 proper porker sausages
- 80g spinach
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausages to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until beginning to brown


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Drain and rinse your butter beans


### Step 3

Once the sausages have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside

Return the dish to a medium heat and add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix, drained butter beans and chopped tomatoes with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the browned sausages to the pot, cover with a lid and put this dish in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 5

Wash your spinach

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half, then slice into 5 strips per person – these are you ciabatta soldiers


### Step 6

After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through the spinach

Make a well per person in the pan and crack your eggs into them

Return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for 6-8 min or until the eggs are done to your liking and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your butter bean, sausage & egg breakfast bake


### Step 7

While the eggs are cooking, add the ciabatta soldiers to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted and charred – these are your toasted soldiers

### Step 8

Serve the butter bean, sausage & egg breakfast bake with the toasted soldiers to the side

Enjoy!
