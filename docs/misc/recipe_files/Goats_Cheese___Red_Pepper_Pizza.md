### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza bases

Divide the tomato sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

### Step 6

Top the pizzas with the torn mozzarella and softened pepper

Sprinkle over your dried oregano

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crispy

### Step 7

While the pizzas are in the oven, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once cooked, remove the pizzas from the oven and break your goats' cheese up all over them – these are your goats' cheese & red pepper pizzas

### Step 8

Serve the goats' cheese & red pepper pizzas with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the balsamic dressing

Enjoy!
