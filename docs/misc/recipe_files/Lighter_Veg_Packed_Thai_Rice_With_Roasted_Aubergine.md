## Ingredients

- 25g roasted peanuts
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 40g Thai red curry paste
- 100g basmati rice
- 25g creamed coconut
- 120g baby corn
- 10g coriander & mint
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 1 lime
- 1 aubergine
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then cut each half, lengthways again, into 3 wedges and score the aubergine flesh in a criss-cross pattern

Add the aubergine wedges to a tray and spread over half of the Thai red curry paste so that they're evenly coated

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until cooked and tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and slice red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and the creamed coconut in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water, then add the remaining Thai red curry paste and give it a good mix up – this is your Thai stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger and cook for 1-2 min further

Add the basmati rice and Thai stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 5

Whilst the rice is cooking, chop the baby corn into small bite-sized pieces

Cut the sugar snap peas in half


### Step 6

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop roughly, discard the stems

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Chop the roasted peanuts roughly (or bash them in the bag with a rolling pin!)


### Step 7

Once the rice has 5 min remaining, add the chopped baby corn and halved sugar snaps and continue to cook, covered, until everything is cooked and tender

Once done, squeeze in the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime – this is your veg-packed Thai rice

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed Thai rice topped with the roasted aubergine wedges

Garnish with the chopped peanuts, chopped herbs and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
