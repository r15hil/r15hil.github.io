## Ingredients

- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Sweetcorn cobettes (2pcs)
- Crispy onions (15g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Yellow pepper
- Parsley (5g)
- Red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece (or two!) of tin foil

Scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender


### Step 2

While the cobettes are in the oven, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Crush your crispy onions in their bag

Combine most of the chopped parsley (save a little for garnish!) and crushed crispy onions in a small bowl – this is your crispy onion crumb


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Once slightly softened, add the sliced peppers and chopped garlic to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for a further 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, add your ground coriander, ground smoked paprika and tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 8-9 min or until the sliced peppers are tender and the sauce has thickened – these are your smoky peppers


### Step 7

When the peppers are almost ready, remove the tray[s] with the cobettes from the oven and add your tortillas

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the tortillas are warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)

### Step 8

Slice the corn from the cooked cobettes (careful they will be hot!), then sprinkle the crispy onion crumb over the top (for a little extra indulgence add a knob of butter!)

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the cobettes whole and don't add the crispy onion crumb!</span>

Divide the smoky peppers evenly between the warmed tortillas and top with the grated cheese and reserved chopped parsley, then season to taste and enjoy!
