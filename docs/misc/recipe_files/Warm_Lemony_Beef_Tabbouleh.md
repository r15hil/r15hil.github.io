- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Garlic clove
- British beef mince (250g)
- Parsley (10g)
- Parsley (5g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3 min or until it's starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Discard any excess oil from the pan, then stir in the chopped garlic, ras el hanout and beef stock mix

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 8-10 min or until the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

While the beef mince is cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dice your tomato[es] finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Add your honey to the beef and continue to cook for 1 min further before removing the pan from the heat to cool slightly – this is your honey beef mince


### Step 6

Add your drained bulgur wheat to a mixing bowl with the diced tomato, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 7

Add the honey beef mince and most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your warm lemony beef tabbouleh

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve your warm lemony beef tabbouleh and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
