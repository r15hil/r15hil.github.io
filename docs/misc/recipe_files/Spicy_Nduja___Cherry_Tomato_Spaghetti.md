## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until they’re starting to break down


### Step 4

Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add your roasted garlic paste and a pinch of sugar and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Return the drained spaghetti to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and set aside until serving


### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste and spinach to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has slightly wilted


### Step 7

Once done, tear your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the pan and add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened to a tomato sauce-like consistency – this is your spicy ’Nduja & cherry tomato sauce

### Step 8

Serve the spicy ’Nduja & cherry tomato sauce over the spaghetti

Garnish with your grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
