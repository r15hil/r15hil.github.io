### Step 2

Add your gnocchi to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the dish in the oven

Cook for 25 min or until the gnocchi is crispy – this is your crispy gnocchi


### Step 3

While the gnocchi is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter

Once melted, add the sliced onion, sliced mushrooms and dried thyme

Add 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[125ml]</span> cold water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the onions and mushrooms are completely softened, stirring occasionally

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese finely

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a small knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel, then add to a baking tray and set aside for later

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!


### Step 5

Once the onions are completely softened, add a small knob of butter and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook, uncovered, for 4-5 min further or until caramelised

Tip: Watch them like a hawk and stir frequently to make sure they don't burn!

Put the broccoli parcel[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once the onions have caramelised, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix, Henderson's Relish and Marmite

Bring to the boil and cook for 1 min or until slightly thickened – this is your French onion & mushroom sauce


### Step 7

Once the gnocchi is crispy, remove the dish from the oven and add the French onion & mushroom sauce

Give everything a good mix up and top with your panko breadcrumbs, grated cheese and a generous grind of pepper

Return the dish to the oven and cook for a further 5-8 min or until golden – this is your French onion crispy gnocchi bake
