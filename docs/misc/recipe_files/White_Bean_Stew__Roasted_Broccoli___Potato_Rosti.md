## Ingredients

- 1 tomato paste sachet (16g)
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 80g baby leaf spinach
- 120g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 can of butter beans (400g)
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 5g thyme
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Peel and grate the potatoes


Add the grated potato to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can


Add the squeezed potato to a bowl with 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> of salt and a pinch of pepper


### Step 2

Add a sheet of non-stick baking paper to a baking tray (or two!) and drizzle with vegetable oil


Add the grated potato to one side of the baking paper and shape into a rectangle (press it down hard to make it as thin as possible!)


Drizzle with vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden brown and crispy – this is your potato rosti


### Step 3

<span class="text-highlight">While the potato rosti is cooking, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></span>


Strip the thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

<span class="text-highlight">Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat</span>


Once hot, add the chopped onion, thyme and garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

Once the rosti has had 10-12 min, add the Tenderstem broccoli to the other side of the tray


Season with a pinch of salt, drizzle with olive oil and return the tray to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the broccoli is golden and tender and the rosti is cooked through


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut the cherry tomatoes in half


Drain and rinse the butter beans 


Add the tomato paste to the softened onion and cook for 1 min further


Add the chopped tomatoes with the red wine vinegar and reduce the heat to low


Cook, covered, for 5-6 min further or until the tomatoes have broken down to create a sauce


### Step 7

Once done, add the baby leaf spinach and drained butter beans to the pan with a pinch of pepper and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your white bean stew


Once the rosti is done, transfer it to a board and cut in half

### Step 8

Serve the roasted broccoli over the rosti halves 


Spoon over the white bean stew


Enjoy!
