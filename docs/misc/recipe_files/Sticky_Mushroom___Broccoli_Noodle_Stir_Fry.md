## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel your garlic and ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Chop all of these together as finely as you can (can't handle the heat? Save some of the chilli for another recipe!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, ginger & chilli and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands

Add your five-spice mix and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

While the mushrooms are cooking, combine your cornflour with 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[125ml]</span> cold water in a bowl and give it a good whisk

Add your hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your sticky stir-fry sauce


### Step 5

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 6

Add your medium egg noodles and halved Tenderstem broccoli to a pot and cover with boiling water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil and cook over a high heat for 5-6 min or until the noodles are cooked and the broccoli is tender

Once done, drain the noodles & broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 7

Once the mushrooms have started to soften, add the sticky stir-fry sauce to the pan with half of the sliced spring onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the mushrooms are cooked through

Add the drained noodles & broccoli and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky mushroom & broccoli noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the sticky mushroom & broccoli noodle stir-fry

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
