## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and grate the garlic

Boil a kettle


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a little drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Once softened, add the dried oregano and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Peel and chop the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans


### Step 4

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Once fragrant, add the drained cannellini beans, chopped sweet potato and a pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the sweet potato is tender


### Step 5

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half, then cut into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> triangles and add them to one side of a non-stick baking paper-lined tray

Spread the remaining grated garlic over the ciabatta and add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and put it in the oven for 10 min or until the ciabatta is lightly toasted and golden

Add the cherry tomatoes to the other side of the tray and put it in the oven for 10 min or until the ciabatta is lightly toasted and golden


### Step 6

Wash the shredded spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is tender, add the soft cheese, shredded spring greens and half of the chopped basil to the pan (save the rest for later!)

Cook, covered, for a final 3 min or until the spring greens are tender – this is your creamy ribollita stew

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Top the toasted ciabatta with the the remaining chopped basil and the roasted cherry tomatoes– this is your garlicky toast

Tip: Use a fork to squish the tomatoes onto the ciabatta to release their juices!

Serve the creamy ribollita stew with the garlicky toast on top

Enjoy!
