## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash is fork-tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened slightly, add the chopped tomato to the pan with your tomato paste, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ras el hanout and half your ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!)

Stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add the cooked butternut squash cubes with the drained chickpeas, vegetable stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, then stir it all together and reduce the heat to medium for 3-4 min until thickened – this is your Moroccan-style squash stew


### Step 6

Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Chop your lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person

Chop your coriander & parsley roughly

Add your cultured coconut to a bowl with the juice of half your lemon wedges, the remaining ginger & garlic paste, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of pepper

Add half the chopped coriander & parsley to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your herby coconut yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style squash stew over the cooked brown rice with a dollop of herby coconut yoghurt and a lemon wedge to the side

Garnish with your flaked almonds and remaining chopped coriander & parsley

Enjoy!
