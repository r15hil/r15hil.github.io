## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the potato pieces to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken breast portion[s] with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and pat them dry with kitchen paper – this is your chicken escalope[s]


### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese into a bowl, add your panko breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy breadcrumb mix


### Step 4

Add the chicken escalope[s] to the bowl of cheesy breadcrumb mix and press them into the mix until nicely coated

Add the coated chicken to the other side of the baking tray[s] with the potatoes

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy baked chicken and roast potatoes

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Peel and chop your red onion[s] roughly and chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water

While the chicken is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


### Step 6

Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette and your tomato paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened

Add the vegetable stock and cook for 1-2 min further

Season generously with salt and pepper – this is your Mediterranean veg


### Step 7

Once done, tear your basil into the pan

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy baked chicken over the Mediterranean veg with the roast potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
