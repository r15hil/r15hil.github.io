Drain the chickpeas

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 6

Once boiling, sit the haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) over the sauce and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your harissa haddock stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Set the harissa haddock stew and warmed ciabattas in the centre of the table, ready to share

Mix the natural yoghurt through the stew and top with the chopped dill

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!
