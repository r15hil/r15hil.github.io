### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s]

Dice your remaining onion finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with your beef stock mix, diced apricots, half your ground cumin, half your ground coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together and add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Cover with a tea towel and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed – this is your couscous

### Step 3

Add the diced onion to a separate bowl with half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!), the remaining ground cumin and remaining ground coriander and mix it all together

Add your beef mince with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your kebab mixture

![Step 4 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-4-1680046436111-x200.jpg)

### Step 4

Divide the kebab mixture into 3 balls per person, then shape the balls into rough oval shapes – these are your beef kebabs

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef kebabs and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned

### Step 5

Once browned, add the sliced onion to the pan and reduce the heat to medium

Cook, covered, for an initial 6-7 min or until the kebabs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion has softened

Once the kebabs are cooked through, remove the lid and cook for a final 2-3 min or until all the liquid in the pan has gone – these are your spiced beef kebabs

### Step 6

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Combine your mayo with the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic mayo

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1680046449650-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Fluff the couscous with a fork and add the grated carrot, then give everything a good mix up – this is your fruity couscous

### Step 8

Serve the spiced beef kebabs with the pan-fried onion over the fruity couscous

Drizzle the garlic mayo over the top and season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!
