## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Ciabatta x2
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Rocket (50g)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Place your sausages on a baking tray (lightly oil the tray before to prevent them from sticking!)

Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden brown


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika over the wedges and put them in the oven for 30 min or until crisp – these are your smoky potato wedges


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5 min or until softened


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, combine your mayo, wholegrain mustard and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a mixing bowl and set aside – this is your wholegrain mustard mayo


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your red wine vinegar, Henderson's Relish, 1.5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp]</span> sugar and a splash of water to the pan

Reduce the heat to low and cook the onion gently for a further 10-15 min, or until sticky and sweet – this is your sticky caramelised red onion relish


### Step 6

Meanwhile, put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty


### Step 7

Whilst the ciabatta is warming up, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper 

Once the sausages are cooked, remove them from the oven and carefully slice them in half lengthways

### Step 8

Cut the crusty ciabatta in half and assemble the sarnie with the sticky caramelised red onion relish and sliced sausages

Serve the salad, smoky potato wedges and wholegrain mustard mayo to the side

Enjoy!
