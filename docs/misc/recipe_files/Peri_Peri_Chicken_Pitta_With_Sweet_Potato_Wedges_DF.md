### Step 7

Add the pittas to the tray with the sweet potato wedges and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Cut the warmed pittas in half and spread the inside of each pitta half with a dollop of coconut yoghurt, then stuff with the peri peri chicken, caramelised onions, shredded lettuce and tomato rounds – these are your peri peri chicken pittas

Serve the peri peri chicken pittas with the sweet potato wedges and any remaining shredded lettuce and tomato rounds to the side
