## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 6 Meatless Farm sausages
- 42g wholegrain mustard
- 3 white potatoes
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 1 apple
- 25g honey	
- 80g shredded kale
- 25g walnuts 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into rough bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt


### Step 3

Add the meat-free sausages to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 18-20 min or until everything is almost cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, combine the wholegrain mustard with the honey, mayo, red wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl – this is your honey mustard dressing


### Step 5

Snap the walnuts in half roughly

Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin wedges, then separate into petals


### Step 6

After an initial 18-20 min, add the onion petals to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a further 5 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Add the halved walnuts for a final 3-4 min or until everything is cooked through and the walnuts are toasted

Tip: Watch the walnuts like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Meanwhile, wash the shredded kale then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Chop the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into matchsticks

Once everything is cooked, add the shredded kale, apple matchsticks, cooked potatoes, roasted onion petals and toasted walnuts to a large bowl

Add half of the honey mustard dressing (you'll use the rest later!) and gently mix together – this is your kale salad with honey mustard dressing

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free sausages over the kale salad

Drizzle the remaining honey mustard dressing all over

Enjoy!
