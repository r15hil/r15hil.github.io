### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Please make sure you cook your salmon thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 2

Now, let's get started

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Boil a full kettle

Once hot, add the salmon fillets to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned on both sides and almost cooked through

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the quick cook amorini to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the amorini for just 2-3 min (it will keep cooking in the sauce later!)

Once done, drain the amorini, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

While the pasta cooks, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 5

Once the salmon is almost cooked, add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 2-3 min further

### Step 6

Carefully peel the skin off the salmon and discard 

Break the salmon into large, bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon, then add the pesto and soft cheese with 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>starchy pasta water and stir it all together

Cook for 1 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly

### Step 7

Add the drained amorini and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy pesto & salmon amorini

### Step 8

Set the creamy pesto & salmon amorini in the centre of the table, ready to share

Tear the basil leaves over, season with a grind of pepper and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
