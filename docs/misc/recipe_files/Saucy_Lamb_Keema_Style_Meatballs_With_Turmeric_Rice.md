## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a high heat

Tear off pieces of your lamb mince, roughly shape into small meatballs (about 6 per person!) and add directly to the pan with a generous pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

Cook for 2 min on each side or until browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with your ground turmeric and a pinch of salt

Add 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your turmeric rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]


### Step 4

Once the meatballs have browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the sliced shallot to the pan and cook for 30 secs


### Step 5

Add your curry powder to the pan with your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes to the pan with your beef stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water

Cook, covered, for 8-9 min, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 7

Once thickened, add your blanched peas to the pan

Cook for a final 1-2 min or until the peas are hot and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your saucy lamb keema-style meatballs

### Step 8

Serve the saucy lamb keema-style meatballs over the turmeric rice

Top with your nigella seeds

Enjoy!
