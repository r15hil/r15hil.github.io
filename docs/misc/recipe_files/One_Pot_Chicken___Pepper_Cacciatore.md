## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs, skin-side down with a pinch of salt and half your dried thyme (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Dissolve your tomato paste, red wine paste and chicken stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red wine stock


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, remove it from the dish and add the chopped onion, pepper and potatoes with the remaining dried thyme, dried oregano, roasted garlic paste and a pinch of salt

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the red wine stock with your chopped tomatoes, a generous grind of black pepper and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then return the browned chicken to the dish, skin side up

Put the dish in the oven, lid off, for 35-40 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables are tender – this is your one-pot chicken & pepper cacciatore


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot chicken & pepper cacciatore and season with a grind of black pepper

Dig in!
