### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the zest of your lime[s] (try to avoid the white pith, as this is very bitter!) to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix – this is your Caribbean-style crumb

### Step 2

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add your smoked basa fillet[s] to the baking tray[s] and top evenly with the Caribbean-style crumb

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the crumb is golden – this is your Caribbean-style smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized chunks

### Step 4

Add the chopped sweet potato to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 5

While the sweet potato is cooking, dice your tomato[es]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, separating the white parts from the green parts

### Step 6

Add the diced tomato and the spring onion whites to a large bowl (save the spring onion greens for garnish) and season with salt and pepper

Cut your lime[s] in half

Add your mango chutney, the juice of half of your lime and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 7

Return the drained sweet potato to a low heat with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt, then mash until smooth

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Caribbean-style smoky basa with the sweet potato mash and tomato salsa to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion greens and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
