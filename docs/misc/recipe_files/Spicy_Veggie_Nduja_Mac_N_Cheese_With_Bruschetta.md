## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 80g cheddar cheese
- 0 macaroni
- 2 tomatoes
- 50g soft cheese
- 1 tsp cornflour
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 40g vegan 'Nduja
- 1 ciabatta 
- 15g pine nuts
- 150g macaroni
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite


### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped tomato, chopped basil and chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your bruschetta mix

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half


### Step 3

Once ready, drain the cooked macaroni and reserve 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> starchy pasta water and set aside until later, reserve the pot


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the grated cheese with your cornflour – this is your coated cheese

Add the coated cheese, soft cheese and 90ml <span class="text-purple">[135ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> milk to the reserved starchy pasta water – this is your cheese sauce mix


### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with the plant based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cheese sauce mix to the pot with a small pinch of salt and pepper

Add the cooked macaroni and cook for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your mac 'n' cheese mix


### Step 6

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mix to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!), top with your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of pepper

Put the dish in the oven for 10 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your spicy veggie 'Nduja mac 'n' cheese

Add the sliced ciabatta to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 6 min


### Step 7

After the initial 6 min, remove the tray with the ciabattas from the oven

Add your pine nuts to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for a final 4 min or until the pine nuts are toasted  – this is your toasted ciabatta & pine nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 8

Top the toasted ciabatta with the bruschetta mix – this is your bruschetta

Serve the spicy veggie 'Nduja mac 'n' cheese and sprinkle over the toasted pine nuts

Enjoy!
