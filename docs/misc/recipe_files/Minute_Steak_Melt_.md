Cut the potatoes (skin on) into 2cm wedges and place on a baking tray with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil and a large pinch of salt

Meanwhile, pat the steaks dry with kitchen towel and coat evenly on both sides with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> vegetable oil and plenty of salt


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once very hot, add the steaks and cook for 1 min on each side


### Step 3

Transfer the cooked steaks to a chopping board and cover with a tea towel to rest


Peel and finely slice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Return the same pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil


Add the onion with a pinch of salt (to draw out the moisture)


Cook for 5 min or until translucent and softened, stirring occasionally


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and grate (or very finely chop) the garlic


Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> red wine vinegar (save the rest for step 5) with the mayonnaise and garlic in a large mixing bowl


Mix with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(6 tbsp)</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> hot water, then season generously with salt and pepper - this is your aioli


### Step 5

Once the onion is soft, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> sugar, Henderson's relish, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(4 tbsp)</span> water and the remaining red wine vinegar to the pan


Reduce the heat to very low and simmer gently for another 10-15 min or until sticky and sweet


Meanwhile, put the ciabattas in the oven for 5 min or until crusty and hot


### Step 6

Slice the cheese into 2 <span class="text-danger">(4)</span> slices


Slice the steak


Wash half <span class="text-danger">(all)</span> the salad (use any remainder for lunch tomorrow) in cold water and pat dry with tea towel


Once hot, remove the ciabattas from the oven and slice in half&nbsp;


### Step 7

Remove your cooked wedges from the oven, turn the oven off and switch the grill to high


Layer over the bottom half of the ciabatta some sticky onions, followed by the steak and top with cheese


Place under the grill for 1-2 min or until the cheese has melted

### Step 8

Set aside half the aioli as a dip for the wedges and toss the salad through the remainder


Enjoy!
