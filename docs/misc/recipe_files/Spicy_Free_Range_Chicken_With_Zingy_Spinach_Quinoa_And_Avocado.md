### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air then boil a kettle

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water,

Add your quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

### Step 2

Once the quinoa is tender, drain, return it to the pot and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice and soy sauce to a plate with a generous grind of pepper and mix it all together to form a paste

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to the paste and turn until well coated

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid, cook for a further 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy free range chicken

### Step 4

Meanwhile, roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] in half

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach, chopped garlic, half of the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), half the sliced spring onion and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) to a food processor

Add the juice of your lime[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and a generous pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your zingy spinach dressing

### Step 6

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways

### Step 7

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Add the drained cannellini beans and a dollop of the zingy spinach dressing to the cooled quinoa and stir it all together – this is your green quinoa

Slice the spicy free range chicken finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced spicy free range chicken over the green quinoa with the sliced avocado to the side

Drizzle over the remaining zingy spinach dressing

Garnish with the reserved sliced spring onion, chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
