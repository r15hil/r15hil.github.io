## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 160g trimmed fine green beans
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 15g roasted garlic paste
- 300g steamed white basmati rice
- 5g parsley
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Chop the green beans in half (cut them in one bunch for speed!)


### Step 3

Once hot, add the roasted garlic paste, king prawns and halved green beans to the pan and cook for 5 min


### Step 4

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!


### Step 5

Dissolve the veg stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your veg stock


### Step 6

Add the smoked paprika, heated basmati rice and veg stock to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your smoky Spanish king prawn rice


### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, combine the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon with the mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your lemon aioli

Squeeze the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon into the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the smoky Spanish king prawn rice with the lemon aioli drizzled over

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges and a grind of black pepper

Tear the parsley leaves all over and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
