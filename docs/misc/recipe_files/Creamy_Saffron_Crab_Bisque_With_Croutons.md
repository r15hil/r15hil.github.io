### Step 2

Heat a large pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel the potato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>and chop into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and saffron in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L] </span>boiled water – this is your saffron stock

### Step 4

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and fennel seeds to the pot and cook for 30 secs or until aromatic (not a big fennel seeds fan? Try using less!)

Once aromatic, add the saffron stock, bay leaves, chopped potato and white crab meat and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until the potatoes are cooked through

### Step 5

While the soup is cooking, tear the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until crisp and golden – these are your ciabatta croutons

### Step 6

Chop the chives finely

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1670332963932-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are cooked through, remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaves

Add 3/4 of the crème fraîche (save the rest for later!) to the pot

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your crab bisque

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the crab bisque in bowls with a dollop of the remaining crème fraîche over the top

Top with the ciabatta croutons and chopped chives

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
