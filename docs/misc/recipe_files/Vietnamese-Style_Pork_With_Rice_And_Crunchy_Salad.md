### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (don't chop!) your ginger

### Step 4

Combine your soy sauce, the juice of your lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated garlic and grated ginger in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your Vietnamese-style marinade

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Trim the fat from the pork loin steak[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 6

Combine the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced cucumber and carrot ribbons in a bowl with half of the Vietnamese-style marinade and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

Add the remaining Vietnamese-style marinade and chopped pork to a bowl and mix until fully combined

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated pork along with any remaining Vietnamese-style marinade from the bowl and cook for 7-8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Vietnamese-style pork

### Step 8

Serve the sticky rice topped with the Vietnamese-style pork and the crunchy salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Garnish with the chopped mint

Enjoy!
