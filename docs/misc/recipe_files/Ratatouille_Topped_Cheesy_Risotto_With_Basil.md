### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and courgette[s] and chop them into bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Add the chopped aubergine, courgette and pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with a very generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and black pepper

Sprinkle over your dried oregano, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 3

While your veg is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1650.-step-5-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and your arborio rice and cook for 30 secs

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until evaporated

Once evaporated, add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your tomato stock

Once the vegetables have had 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved cherry tomatoes and tomato stock

Mix it all together and return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5-8 min – this is your ratatouille

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1650.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese

Once the rice is cooked, add a knob of butter and half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and gently stir it all together – this is your cheesy risotto

### Step 8

Serve the ratatouille over the cheesy risotto

Top with the chopped basil and remaining grated cheese

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
