### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until softened

### Step 2

While the onion is softening, dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

### Step 3

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your soft cheese to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your soft cheese mix

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 2-3 min or until beginning to caramelise – this is your caramelised onion

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1679066905872-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Spread the soft cheese mix over the pastry, keeping it within the borders

Top with the caramelised onion and tear over your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pastry is golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your creamy sausage & red onion tart[s]

### Step 7

While the tart[s] is cooking, combine the remaining red wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the dressing and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sausage & red onion tart with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
