## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

While the onion softens, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml [<span class="text-purple">975ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice with the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains of rice in the oil

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed


### Step 4

Season your crab meat with a pinch of salt and set aside for later


### Step 5

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the seasoned crab meat to the pan with your blanched peas and give everything a good mix up

Add any remaining vegetable stock and cook for a further 5 min or until the peas are tender and the rice is cooked


### Step 7

Once done, add most of the grated cheese (save some for garnish!) with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and a knob of butter

Stir it all together – this is your lemony crab & pea risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the lemony crab & pea risotto topped with the remaining grated cheese and a handful of salad

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season generously with pepper

Enjoy!
