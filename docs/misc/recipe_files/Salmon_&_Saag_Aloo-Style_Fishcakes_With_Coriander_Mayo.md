### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and run the potatoes under cold water until cool, then return to the pot and crush

### Step 2

Reboil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly

### Step 4

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander (reserve a little of both for garnish!) to a food processor with your white wine vinegar, mayo and a drizzle of olive oil and blitz – this is your coriander mayo

### Step 5

Combine your panko breadcrumbs with your nigella seeds on a plate – these are your nigella breadcrumbs

Add your salmon flakes to the crushed potatoes, with your curry powder, vegetable stock mix, chopped spinach, 2/3 of the chopped ginger and garlic (save the rest for later!) and mix

Divide the mix and shape them into 2 fishcakes per person, then press into the nigella breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat – these are your salmon & saag aloo-style fishcakes

### Step 6

Add the salmon & saag aloo-style fishcakes to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two), drizzle with olive oil and put in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden

Trim your green beans

Add the trimmed green beans to a large piece of tin foil with the remaining chopped ginger and garlic, a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1667322299551-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!)

When the fishcakes have 12 min remaining, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the parcel[s] to the other side, then return it to the oven for a final 12 min until tender with a slight bite – these are your fragrant green beans

### Step 8

Serve the salmon & saag aloo-style fishcakes with the fragrant green beans to the side

Drizzle the coriander mayo all over and garnish with the reserved chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and coriander 

Enjoy!
