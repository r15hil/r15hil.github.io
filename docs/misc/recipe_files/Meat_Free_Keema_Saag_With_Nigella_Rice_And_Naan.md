### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tip: This is just to warm your naans (alternatively, just pop them in the toaster)

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the nigella seeds and basmati rice and cook for 1 min or until fragrant and lightly toasted

### Step 2

Once toasted, add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

When the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Remove the rice from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your nigella rice

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 7-10 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve the veg stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Reboil a kettle

### Step 5

Wash the baby leaf spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

### Step 6

Add the meat-free mince, garam masala, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground fenugreek to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the tomato wedges, chopped spinach and tomato stock and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your meat-free keema saag

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1627379756311-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the garlic & coriander naans to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the naan is hot

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the naan before it goes in the oven!

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free keema saag with the nigella rice and warmed naan to the side

Enjoy!
