### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your red potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Combine the chopped potato, ground smoked paprika, 3/4 of your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil on a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) then put in the oven for an initial 20 min or until tender – these are your smoky potatoes

After the initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push the potatoes to one side
