Once the butter beans and vegetables have had an initial 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and top with the grated cheese

Return the dish to the oven for a further 5 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your baked veggie 'Nduja taco filling

Add your tortillas to a baking tray, then put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)

### Step 8

Top your warmed tortillas with the baked veggie 'Nduja taco filling, shredded lettuce and the coriander lime crema – these are your veggie 'Nduja & butter bean tacos with lime crema

Garnish with a lime wedge
