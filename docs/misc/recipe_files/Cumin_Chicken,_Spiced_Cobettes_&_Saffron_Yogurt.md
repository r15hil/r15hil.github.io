### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Coat the chicken breasts with the ground cumin and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 2

Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil

Add the ground paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and top with a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to a baking tray lined with tin foil

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the corn is tender

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat

Whilst the chicken is browning, add the saffron to 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> hot water and set aside to infuse – this is your saffron liquid

### Step 4

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

Transfer the browned chicken to the baking tray with the cobettes and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to rest before slicing

### Step 6

Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Once hot add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until caramelised

Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly and roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface and cut into wedges

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1597161742983-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine the chopped coriander, natural yogurt, saffron liquid and a squeeze of lime juice

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander & saffron yogurt

Once the onion has caramelised, add the balsamic vinegar with a pinch of brown sugar and cook for 1-2 min further or until the vinegar has been absorbed

### Step 8

Add the caramelised onion to the cooked rice and mix it all together – this is your caramelised onion rice

Serve the cumin chicken over the caramelised onion rice with the spiced cobettes to the side

Drizzle over the coriander & saffron yogurt and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
