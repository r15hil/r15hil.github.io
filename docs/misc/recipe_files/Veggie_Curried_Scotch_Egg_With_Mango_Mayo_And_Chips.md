## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 20g mango chutney
- 2 ultimate vegan burger patties
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 3 white potatoes
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add the eggs to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 5 min, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked eggs to the bowl to cool down quickly


### Step 2

While the eggs are cooking, cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Peel and finely chop half the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the remaining onion

Add the sliced onion to a large bowl with the rice vinegar and a pinch of  sugar, then set aside for later – these are your quick-pickled onions


### Step 3

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt, then put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

Add the vegan burger patties to a large bowl with the chopped red onion, grated garlic and curry powder and give everything a good mix up (use clean hands!) – this is your veggie mixture


### Step 4

Add a sheet of baking paper to your chopping board and sprinkle over a  generous dusting of flour

Form half the veggie mixture into a giant meatball, then flatten the meatball into a circle (big enough to coat an egg) onto the floured baking paper

Repeat this with the remaining veggie mixture until you have 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> veggie mixture circles


### Step 5

Peel the cooled eggs

Add a peeled egg to the centre of each veggie mixture circle

Wrap the veggie mixture around each peeled egg and seal it tightly on all sides so that there aren't any gaps – these are your veggie-coated eggs


### Step 6

Add the panko breadcrumbs and nigella seeds to a plate with a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – these are your nigella breadcrumbs

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a separate plate

Turn the veggie-coated eggs in the vegetable oil, shake off the excess, then add them to the nigella breadcrumbs and press firmly until they're evenly coated all over – these are your breaded eggs


### Step 7

Add the breaded eggs to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 22-25 min, or until golden and crispy – these are your veggie curried scotch eggs

Meanwhile, combine the mayo and mango chutney in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo

Wash the baby leaf salad, then add to the quick-pickled onions with a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your pickled onion salad

### Step 8

Serve the veggie curried scotch eggs with the pickled onion salad, chips and mango mayo to the side

Enjoy!
