## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take the chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned


### Step 2

Once browned, add your ground cumin, dried oregano and a couple splashes of cold water to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer to a clean board (reserve the pan) and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Return the pan to a medium heat and add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced red onion and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [30g]</span> flour and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir with a wooden spoon for 3-4 min or until a paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 4

Add your tomato paste, chicken stock mix and chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Gradually whisk in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [680ml] </span>boiled<span class="text-danger"> </span>water, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min (stirring occasionally) or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your chipotle sauce

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 5

Remove 1/3 of the chipotle sauce to a small pot – this is your enchilada topping

Add the drained black beans and pulled chicken to the remaining sauce in the pan and give it a good mix up – this is your chicken & black bean filling


### Step 6

Reheat the enchilada topping over a high heat for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream consistency

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Trim and slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little vegetable oil


### Step 7

Divide the chicken & black bean filling between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and place them in the oven-proof dish

Top with the enchilada topping and grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tortillas are crispy and the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy chipotle chicken enchiladas

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy chipotle chicken enchiladas and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
