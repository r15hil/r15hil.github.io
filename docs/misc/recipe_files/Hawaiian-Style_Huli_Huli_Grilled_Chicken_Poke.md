## Description

Traditionally, huli huli chicken should be turned several times during cooking. For our easy twist, you'll grill the chicken with a sweet 'n' savoury pineapple glaze, and assemble it Hawaii style – in a vibrant poke bowl.

### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Meanwhile, peel your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and slice into thin rounds

Add the sliced shallot rounds to a small bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar, then set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook on one side for 4 min or until golden

Preheat the grill to high

Drain your pineapple (keep the juice for later!)

### Step 4

Combine the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, tamari soy sauce, pineapple juice and half your sriracha (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar in a separate small bowl – this is your huli huli sauce

Turn the chicken thighs over and add the huli huli sauce to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced to a syrup-like consistency – this is your huli huli chicken

### Step 5

Boil a kettle

Add the huli huli chicken with any remaining huli huli sauce to a tin foil-lined tray and put under the grill for 5 min or until charred, caramelised and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your huli huli grilled chicken

Return the pan to the heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil, add 1 pineapple ring per person and cook for 3-4 min, turning once until charred – this is your charred pineapple

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your edamame beans to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them, then set aside to cool

Chop the remaining pineapple into bite-sized pieces

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1629817260198-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine the refreshed edamame beans with your mayo and remaining sriracha in a bowl and mix everything together – these are your creamy sriracha edamame beans

### Step 8

Serve the cooked sushi rice with the huli huli grilled chicken, chopped pineapple, creamy sriracha edamame beans and charred pineapple on top

Sprinkle your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over the chopped pineapple and top with the quick-pickled shallot

Enjoy!
