### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until starting to brown

### Step 3

Once the potatoes have been in the oven for 15 min, remove the tray[s] and add the torn ciabatta, onion wedges, tomato wedges, half your dried oregano and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the other side

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 15 min or until the potatoes and the ciabatta is golden and crispy

### Step 4

While the veg is cooking, add a handful of flour to a plate with the remaining dried oregano and a pinch of salt – this is your herby flour

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add to the herby flour, turn several times until fully coated – this is your coated hake

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake with a pinch of salt and cook for 6 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Add your red wine vinegar to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your dressing

Once the croutons and roasted veg are cooked, add them to the dressing with the sliced cucumber

Crumble in your feta and gently toss it all together – this is your roasted Greek-style salad

### Step 8

Serve your pan-fried hake with the crispy potatoes and roasted Greek-style salad to the side

Drizzle the garlic mayo over the hake and potatoes

Enjoy!
