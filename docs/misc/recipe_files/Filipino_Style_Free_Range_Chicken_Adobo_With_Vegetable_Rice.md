## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, add the free range chicken thighs and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until slightly brown, then transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the pan and any remaining oil for later


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, trim your green beans, then chop in half


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high and return the free range chicken thighs to the pan

Add your bay leaf[ves], chopped garlic, soy sauce and 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the sauce has reduced slightly


### Step 5

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

When the rice is boiling, add your Tenderstem broccoli and halved green beans and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your vegetable rice


### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 7

Once the sauce has reduced, add your cider vinegar and chopped ginger to the chicken and cook, covered, for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Season the cooked chicken with a generous grind of black pepper and transfer it to a clean board

Shred the seasoned chicken apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

### Step 8

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Filipino-style free range chicken adobo

Serve the Filipino-style free range chicken adobo with the vegetable rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
