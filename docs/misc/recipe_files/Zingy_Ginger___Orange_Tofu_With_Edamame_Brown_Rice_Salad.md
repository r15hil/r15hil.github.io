### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Peel and grate your garlic

Cut your orange[s] in half

### Step 3

Combine the grated ginger, grated garlic, soy sauce and the juice of the orange[s] in a bowl — this is your zingy ginger & orange dressing

### Step 4

Drain your tofu, pat it dry with kitchen paper and cut into strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the tofu strips and 1/3 of the zingy ginger & orange dressing (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp – this is your zingy ginger & orange tofu

### Step 5

### Step 6

Whilst the tofu is cooking, top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Chop the root[s] off your lettuce and discard

Separate the leaves, then wash and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Set aside until serving

### Step 7

Slice your cucumber into discs, then slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Add your blanched edamame beans and cucumber matchsticks to the brown rice with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up — this is your edamame brown rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the zingy ginger & orange tofu over the edamame brown rice salad with the lettuce leaves and carrot ribbons to the side

Drizzle the reserved zingy ginger & orange dressing all over

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
