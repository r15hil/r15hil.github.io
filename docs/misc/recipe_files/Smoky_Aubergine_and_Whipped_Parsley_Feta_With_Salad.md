## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut in half lengthways

Slice each half, lengthways, into 5 strips


### Step 2

Add the aubergine strips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the aubergine is golden and softened – these are your smoky aubergine strips


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)


### Step 4

Add your feta to a food processor with the juice of your lemon[s], the chopped parsley, chopped garlic, dried oregano and mayo

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water with a pinch of pepper and blitz until smooth and creamy

Put the mixture in the fridge until serving – this is your whipped parsley feta


### Step 5

Combine your Dijon mustard with your honey, lemon zest, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your honey mustard dressing


### Step 6

Once the aubergine is cooked, remove the baking tray[s] from the oven and set the aubergine strips aside (baking paper included!), reserve the baking tray[s]

Add your plain naan[s] to the reserved baking tray[s], splash with a little cold water and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot


### Step 7

Once hot, transfer the naan[s] to a chopping board and cut into strips (careful, they may be hot!)

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To serve, layer the whipped parsley feta with the sliced naan and smoky aubergine strips

Top with the salad and drizzle over the honey mustard dressing

Enjoy!
