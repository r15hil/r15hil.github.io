### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Wash then remove leaves (1 per person!) from your lettuce and set aside, then wedge the inner core

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a generous knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Cook for 1-2 min or until melted

Once melted, add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your sriracha (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min or until very fragrant – this is your chilli butter

Once fragrant, transfer the chilli butter to a small heatproof bowl and reserve the pan

### Step 4

Divide your meat-free patty[ies] into 2 pieces per person and transfer them to a chopping board with a handful of flour, then cover with a sheet of baking paper and roll them out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your patties

Set aside the baking paper and top the patties with the sliced chillies, the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of pepper, then return the baking paper and roll until the chillies are pressed into the patties

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties (chilli-side down!)

Press them down very firmly with a spatula and cook for 2-3 min on one side, pressing down continuously, until slightly charred

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1721212715181-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once slightly charred, flip the patties over

Top half the patties with your sliced vegan cheese and cook, covered, for a final 2-3 min or until slightly charred and cooked through – these are your chilli smash patties

Meanwhile, combine the chilli butter with your vegan mayo, half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of pepper – this is your firesauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1721212782825-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] with the wedges from the oven and add the brioche halves (cut side up!) on top of the wedges

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build the burger, top the warmed brioche base with an outer lettuce leaf, 2 chilli smash patties, a generous dollop of the firesauce and a warmed brioche lid – this is your inferno chilli cheese smash patty burger

Serve the lettuce wedges and drizzle over the remaining white wine vinegar and a little drizzle of olive oil with the potato wedges and any remaining firesauce to the side

Enjoy!
