- Arborio rice (160g)
- Raw peeled king prawns (171g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Parsley (5g)
- Courgette
- Brown onion
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 2

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in<span class="text-danger"> </span>700ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Add your arborio rice and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry

Add your vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

While the risotto is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!) and set aside for garnish


### Step 6

Once the rice is cooked, squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s]

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Add a knob of butter and the grated cheese to the pan and stir to combine – this is your lemony risotto


### Step 7

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, drain your king prawns then add to the pan with the remaining garlic, chopped courgette and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your garlic king prawns & courgette

Once cooked, remove from the heat and stir through most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!)

### Step 8

Serve the garlic king prawns & courgette over the lemony risotto

Garnish with a lemon wedge, the lemon zest and reserved chopped parsley

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
