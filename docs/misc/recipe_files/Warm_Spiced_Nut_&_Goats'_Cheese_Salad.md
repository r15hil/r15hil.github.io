### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Chop the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>&nbsp;(skins on) into large bite-size pieces

### Step 2

Add the sweet potato and onion to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess)

### Step 6

Grind a generous amount of pepper onto a clean chopping board and add the crushed nuts


Roll the goats' cheese in the toasted nuts and pepper&nbsp;

Reserve the nuts that didn't make it for garnish!

### Step 7

Once the vegetables are done, carefully remove the skins from the cooked onion by cutting off the root and peeling the skin off

### Step 8

Slice the goats' cheese into thick slices or break it up into rough pieces&nbsp;


Serve the salad with the goat's cheese over the top


Enjoy!
