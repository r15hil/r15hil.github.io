Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] and remaining diced onion together as finely as you can

Add your natural yoghurt to a separate small bowl with your remaining ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and mix until fully combined – this is your smoky yoghurt

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and roughly chop

Return the chopped chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken fajita mix
