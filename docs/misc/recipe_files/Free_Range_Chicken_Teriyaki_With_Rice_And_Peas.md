### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on)

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until browned all over

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 4

Combine the chopped ginger, rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> brown sugar in a bowl

Give it a good mix up – this is your teriyaki sauce

### Step 5

Once the rice is cooked, add your blanched peas to the same pot (on top of the rice) and put the lid back on for 3 min or until the peas are warmed through

### Step 6

Once the chicken is browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the teriyaki sauce to the chicken and stir to combine

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has reduced to a sticky consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)– this is your free range chicken teriyaki

Trim, then finely chop your spring onion[s]

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and add your toasted sesame seeds

### Step 8

Serve the free range chicken teriyaki over the cooked rice & peas

Garnish with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
