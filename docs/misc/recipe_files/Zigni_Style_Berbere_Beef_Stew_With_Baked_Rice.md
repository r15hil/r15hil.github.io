## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your diced beef to the dish with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and cut your shallot[s] in half

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Cut your ginger in half (no need to peel!)


### Step 5

Add the halved shallot, pepper strips, halved ginger and crushed garlic to the dish with your berbere seasoning, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[750ml] </span>boiled water with the beef stock mix and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Once boiling, cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 1 hour or until the sauce is rich and the beef is tender – this is your zigni-style berbere beef stew


### Step 7

Once the stew has had 30 min in the oven, reboil a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Serve the zigni-style berbere beef stew with baked rice to the side
