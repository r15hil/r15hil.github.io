## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 250ml single soya
- 300g steamed brown basmati rice
- 21g wholegrain mustard

- 50g baby leaf salad
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 250g British diced chicken breast
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Combine the red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your vinaigrette


### Step 3

When the pan is hot, add the diced chicken and cook for 2-3 min and then add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>of flour


### Step 4

Dissolve chicken stock mix and the wholegrain mustard in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water – this is your mustard stock

Crumble the chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for a further 2 min


### Step 5

Add the Chinese rice wine, mustard stock and the single soya and bring to the boil over a high heat for a final 3 min or until the chicken is cooked through

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your dairy-free chicken & mushroom fricassée

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 6

Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed brown rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

### Step 8

Set the dairy-free chicken & mushroom fricassée, basmati rice and baby leaf salad in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish the fricassée with the sliced spring onions, drizzle the baby leaf salad with the vinaigrette and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
