### Step 2

Gradually whisk 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add the double cream, Dijon mustard and half the Marmite (save the rest for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, stir it all together and remove the pan from the heat – this is your Marmite béchamel sauce
