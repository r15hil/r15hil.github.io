## Ingredients

- Dried sage (1tsp)
- Parsnip
- Proper Porker sausages (3pcs) x0
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Proper Porker sausages (6pcs)
- Apple
- Carrot
- Fine green beans (80g)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] roughly

Top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] into quarters lengthways, then into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes, chopped carrot and chopped parsnip to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Add your sausages to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Slice your apple[s] finely (skin on), discard the core[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced apple with 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to caramelise

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 5

While the apple caramelises, dissolve your beef stock mix, onion marmalade and dried sage in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water – this is your onion stock

Once caramelised, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour to the pan and give everything a good mix up until a sandy paste forms

Gradually stir in your onion stock and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your toffee apple gravy


### Step 6

Trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes & veg to a low heat with a small knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth – this is your root veg mash

### Step 8

Serve the sausages over the root veg mash with the green beans to the side

Pour the toffee apple gravy all over

Enjoy!
