## Ingredients

- 11g beef stock mix
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 carrot
- 250g British beef mince
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 50g rocket
- 125g mozzarella
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice the sweet potatoes (skins on) into discs (approx. 0.5cm thick)

Add the sweet potato discs to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 10-12 min until softened slightly


### Step 2

Whilst the sweet potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into bite-sized pieces

Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the beef mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

While the beef is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the beef stock mix, tomato paste, dried oregano and a pinch of sugar in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the beef has browned, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency and the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your ragù

Meanwhile, add a pot to a medium heat with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil, once hot, add 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 6

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time and cook for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper – this is your béchamel sauce

While the béchamel is cooking, combine the balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Layer the bottom of an oven-proof dish with half of the sweet potato discs followed by half of the ragú, half of the béchamel sauce and half of the torn mozzarella

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of the remaining béchamel sauce

Top with the remaining torn mozzarella and cook in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your beef mince & sweet potato lasagne

### Step 8

Serve the beef mince & sweet potato lasagne with the rocket to the side

Drizzle the dressing over the rocket

Enjoy!
