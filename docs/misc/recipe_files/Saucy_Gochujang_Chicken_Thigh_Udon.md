## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 6 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely chop your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Add the sliced courgette, chopped spring onion, your ginger & garlic paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the chicken and cook for 2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your cornflour and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a small bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water, then stir in your soy sauce and gochujang paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your gochujang sauce


### Step 6

Add your udon noodles to the pan, gently separating them with a fork

Once separated add the gochujang sauce and cook for 2 min further, stirring until the noodles are coated in the sauce and your chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through your toasted sesame oil – this is your saucy gochujang chicken thigh udon

### Step 8

Serve the saucy gochujang chicken thigh udon

Garnish with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!
