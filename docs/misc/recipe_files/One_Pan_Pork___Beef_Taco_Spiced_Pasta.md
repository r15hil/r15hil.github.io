## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely dice half your red onion[s]

Slice the remaining onion finely

Slice your green chilli[es] finely


### Step 2

Heat a pot (with a lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with your pork & beef mince (remove the paper if required!)

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Once the mince is beginning to brown, reduce the heat to medium high, then add your ground smoked paprika, ground coriander and chopped garlic

Add your tomato paste and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your conchiglie with your beef stock mix and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 11-14 min, or until the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite – this is your taco-spiced pasta

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it from sticking!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of sugar in a bowl

Add the sliced onion, chopped tomato and remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and give it a good mix up – this is your green chilli salsa


### Step 7

Once the pasta is ready, add your soft cheese with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up

Top with the grated cheese (don't mix!) and set aside, covered, for 1-2 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your one pan pork & beef taco spiced pasta

### Step 8

Top the one pan pork & beef taco spiced pasta with the green chilli salsa

Enjoy!
