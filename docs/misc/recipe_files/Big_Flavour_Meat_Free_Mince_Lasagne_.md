## Ingredients

- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 1 tomato paste
- 6 lasagne sheets
- 32g tomato paste
- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 vegetable stock mix
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 carrot
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, and finely dice your carrot[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened

Boil a kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the onion and carrot have softened, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk to a pot over a low heat with your bay leaf[ves] and leave to infuse for 4-5 min


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, Henderson's Relish and dried oregano in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[650ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once the meat-free mince has browned, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan with your hands

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your meat-free ragù

Remove the bay leaf[ves] from the infused milk and discard


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a separate pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add the infused milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your béchamel

### Step 7

Layer some of the ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish

Cover with the béchamel, top with the grated Italian hard cheese and cook in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked

### Step 8

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper– this is your dressing

Serve the meat-free mince lasagne with the baby leaf salad to the side and the dressing drizzled over and enjoy!
