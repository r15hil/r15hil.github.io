## Ingredients

- Gluten free soy sauce (15ml) x2
- Red pepper
- Rice noodles (200g)
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Carrot
- Mangetout (80g)
- Lime
- Roasted peanuts (25g)
- Smooth peanut butter (26g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 2

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 3

Reboil half a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

While the pepper is softening, dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and gluten free soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water

Add your peanut butter, red chilli relish and the juice of half your lime[s] with a pinch of sugar – this is your satay sauce

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Once the pepper has softened, add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your mangetout and carrot ribbons and cook for 2-3 min or until softened


### Step 7

Once the veg has softened, add your rice noodles and satay sauce to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – this is your plant-based Indonesian-style satay noodles

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based Indonesian-style satay noodles

Sprinkle over the chopped peanuts and chopped coriander

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
