## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Thai basil (5g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Udon noodles (200g) x2
- Orange
- Spring onion
- British pork mince (125g) x0
- Tamarind paste (15g)
- Fish sauce (8ml)
- British pork mince (250g)
- Garlic clove
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Honey (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your udon noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water

Set aside to soak for 4-5 min

Drain the soaked noodles

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!


### Step 2

While the noodles are soaking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go or until starting to brown and crisp


### Step 3

While the pork is browning, peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Cut your orange[s] in half, then peel and roughly chop half the orange[s] and set aside

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Combine the chopped orange in a small bowl with your tamarind paste, honey and soy sauce

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and fish sauce with the juice of the remaining orange and give everything a good mix up – this is your orange nam jim sauce


### Step 5

Once the mince is starting to brown, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the chopped garlic and sliced spring onion and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your drained udon noodles and spinach to the pan with a splash of cold water and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has started to wilt


### Step 7

Once wilted, add the orange nam jim sauce to the pan and mix it all together

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened, the noodles are fully coated and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your sticky nam jim pork & orange udon noodles

### Step 8

Serve the sticky nam jim pork & orange udon noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and chop your Thai basil roughly over the top with scissors

Enjoy!
