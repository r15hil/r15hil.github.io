### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

While the beef is browning, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the rest

### Step 4

Once the beef has browned, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Cook for a further 2 min or until fragrant, then add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water with your red chilli relish and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min or until the beef is sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Thai-style sticky chilli beef

### Step 5

While the beef is cooking, combine the remaining soy sauce in a bowl with the juice of half your lime[s], your fish sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your Thai-style dressing

Add your mooli slaw mix to your Thai-style dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai-style slaw

### Step 6

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1673867344477-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add it to the Thai-style slaw and give everything a good mix up – this is your fragrant rice salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style sticky chilli beef over the fragrant rice salad, topped with the chopped coriander, mint leaves and your crispy onions

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
