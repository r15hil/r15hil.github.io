### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

### Step 3

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

### Step 4

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 5

Once the pepper is starting to soften, add your ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground smoked paprika and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, increase the heat to high, then drain your jumbo prawns and add them to the pan with your blanched peas and cook for an initial 5 min or until almost cooked through

### Step 6

Whilst the prawns are cooking, combine your mayo, tomato ketchup, wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!), most of your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a squeeze of lemon juice in a bowl – this is your Cajun-style mayo

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1595251155787-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the prawns are almost done, add the cooked rice with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min further or until the prawns are cooked through

Once done, add a squeeze of lemon juice and give everything a good mix up – this is your jumbo prawn jambalaya

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 8

Serve the jumbo prawn jambalaya and drizzle over the Cajun-style mayo

Garnish with a sprinkling of the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
