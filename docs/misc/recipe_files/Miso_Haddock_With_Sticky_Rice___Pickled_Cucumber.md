### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the cucumber ribbons to a bowl with the rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

Pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

### Step 6

Once softened, add the ginger & garlic paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the haddock bites to the pan and cook for 3 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Once cooked, add the miso sauce to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your miso haddock

### Step 8

Serve the miso haddock with the sticky rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Serve the quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
