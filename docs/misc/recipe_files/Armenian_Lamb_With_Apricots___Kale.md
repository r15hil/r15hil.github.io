## Description

This hearty dish takes influence from a 'khashlama', an Armenian stew packed with veg and deep, rich flavour. We've spiced our version up with earthy cumin and fragrant allspice. You'll serve it with caramelised red onion pilaf – perfect for soaking up all the delicious juices! (Gluten-free, suitable for coeliacs).

### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely (skins on) into discs


Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the sliced carrot and cook for 1-2 min


Add the lamb mince with the chopped garlic, ground cumin and allspice and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


Heat a pot with a matching lid with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once the butter has melted, add the sliced red onion, cumin seeds and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 10-15 min or until caramelised

Once the onions have caramelised, add the basmati rice to the pot and cook for 1 min


Add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, add the shredded kale to the lamb and cook for a further 2-3 min or until wilted


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lamb &amp; kale stew
