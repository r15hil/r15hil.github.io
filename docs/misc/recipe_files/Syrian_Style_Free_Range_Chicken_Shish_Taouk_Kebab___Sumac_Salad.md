## Ingredients

- Tomato paste (16g)
- Gem lettuce
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Tomato
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Ground paprika (1tsp)
- Ground paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ground sumac (1tsp)
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Garlic clove x3
- Skewers x4
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Soak your skewer[s] in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)


### Step 2

Chop your free range chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add 2/3 of your natural yoghurt to a large bowl (save the rest for later!) with the ground paprika, half your ground sumac, half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), tomato paste, chopped garlic and a drizzle of olive oil

Add a very generous pinch of salt, and a pinch of sugar and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your shish taouk marinade


### Step 4

Add the chopped chicken and onion petals to the marinade

Give everything a good mix up until everything is well coated, then thread the coated chicken and onion petals onto the skewers


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil, once hot add the chicken skewers and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until slightly charred (you may need to do this in batches!)

Once slightly charred, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for a further 8-10 min, turning half way, or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Syrian-style free range chicken shish taouk kebab


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Dice your tomato[es] finely

Add the shredded lettuce to a large bowl with the diced tomato, remaining ground sumac, remaining cider vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Toss everything together – this is your sumac salad


### Step 7

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through, then slice in half

### Step 8

Serve the Syrian-style free range chicken shish taouk kebab with the sumac salad and toasted pitta halves to the side

Drizzle any remaining juices from the pan over the chicken and top the salad with the remaining natural yoghurt

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
