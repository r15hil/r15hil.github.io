## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[</span>2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, curry powder and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 2 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim and cut your green beans in half


### Step 4

Once the onion is starting to soften, add your lamb mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Sprinkle in your chicken stock mix and add your tomato paste


### Step 5

Cook for a further 2 min or until the lamb is starting to caramelise

Stir in your basmati rice


### Step 6

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan with the halved green beans and sultanas and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed, the rice is cooked and the lamb mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice is not fully cooked or the mixture is looking a little dry


### Step 7

Once cooked, fluff the rice with a fork

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your lamb biryani

### Step 8

Serve the lamb biryani with a dollop of natural yoghurt on top

Enjoy!
