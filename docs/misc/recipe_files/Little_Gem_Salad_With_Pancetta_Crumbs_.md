## Description

This is a spin on the classic 'wedge' salad. We've kept the wedges of crisp lettuce, tomatoes and creamy dressing but have topped the lot off with a free-range fried egg. We've also replaced bacon with herbed pancetta and croutons for crispy breadcrumbs, which are combined into crispy pancetta crumbs - best of both!
