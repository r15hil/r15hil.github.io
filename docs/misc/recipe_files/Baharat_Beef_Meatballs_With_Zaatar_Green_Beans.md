## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your toasted sesame seeds, cumin seeds, dried oregano and ground sumac with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a pestle & mortar, reserve the pan


### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth (this can be quickly reheated before serving!)


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Combine half the chopped garlic, half your baharat and 1/3 of the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!) in a medium bowl with your beef mince and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!), then divide and shape them into meatballs (3 per person!) – these are your baharat meatballs


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the baharat meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and reboil half a kettle

Dice your tomato[es] roughly

Grind the toasted mixture coarsely in the pestle & mortar – this is your za'atar


### Step 5

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the remaining diced onion, chopped garlic and diced tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until the tomatoes have softened

Add your tomato paste, remaining baharat and half the za'atar (save the rest for later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your beef stock mix with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until slightly thickened

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the sauce is thickening, trim your green beans


### Step 7

Add the green beans to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water, the remaining za'atar and and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite

### Step 8

Serve the baharat meatballs over the mash with the za'atar green beans to the side

Drizzle any remaining za'atar butter from the beans over the mash

Enjoy!
