- Crispy onions (15g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up


### Step 2

Add your sausages to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the chips are crispy and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon and discard

Dice half the deseeded cucumber very finely (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]


### Step 4

Combine the diced cucumber, chopped shallot and cider vinegar with your sweet pepper relish, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>sugar and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber relish


### Step 5

Finely slice the remaining deseeded cucumber


### Step 6

Once the sausages and chips have had 20 min, put your bread roll[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until hot and crusty

Once done, carefully slice in half


### Step 7

Slice the cooked sausages in half

Drain the quick-pickled cucumber relish

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Fill the warmed bread roll with the sliced sausages, mustard ketchup and quick-pickled cucumber relish, then top with the crispy onions – this is your American-style sausage sarnie

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Top the salad with the sliced cucumber and drizzle with some olive oil

Enjoy!
