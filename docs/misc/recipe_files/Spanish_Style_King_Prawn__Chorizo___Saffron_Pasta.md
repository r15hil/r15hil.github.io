## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Cut the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the diced chorizo and chopped pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper starts to soften


### Step 4

Add the quick cook amorini to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked amorini, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the pepper is starting to soften, add the saffron, roasted garlic paste, smoked paprika and tomato paste

Give everything a good mix up, then drain the king prawns and add them to the pan with the soft cheese

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through


### Step 6

Once the king prawns are done, add the drained amorini to the pan with a splash of the starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up – this is your Spanish-style king prawn, chorizo & saffron pasta


### Step 7

Add the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon and stir it all together

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the Spanish-style king prawn, chorizo & saffron pasta with a good grind of black pepper

Top with the pea shoots and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
