### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways and score the flesh quite deeply (in a diamond pattern) taking care not to cut through the skin

Add the aubergine halves to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Combine your toasted sesame oil and agave in a bowl with your ground coriander, cornflour and half your gluten free soy sauce and set aside until later – this is your sesame marinade

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Add your basmati rice, hoisin sauce, Chinese rice wine, ginger & garlic paste and remaining gluten free soy sauce and stir it all together

### Step 4

Add your vegetable stock mix with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 5

Once the aubergine is starting to soften, take the tray out of the oven and spread the sesame marinade over the aubergine

Return the tray to the oven for a final 10-15 min or until tender – this is your oven-baked sticky sesame aubergine

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1672751902393-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Once the rice is cooked, stir the spinach and blanched edamame beans through and cover until the spinach has wilted – this is your hoisin rice

### Step 8

To serve, top the hoisin rice with the oven-baked sticky sesame aubergine

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds and drizzle over any remaining juices from the aubergine

Dig in!
