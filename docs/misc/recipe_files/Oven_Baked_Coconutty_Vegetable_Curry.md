## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


### Step 3

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Add your ginger paste and the chopped sweet potato[es] to the dish and give everything a good stir


### Step 4

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 5

Add the halved green beans and halved cherry tomatoes to the dish with your tomato paste, nigella seeds, ground turmeric and curry powder and stir it all together


### Step 6

Add your vegetable stock mix with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid, and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the sweet potato is tender – this is your oven-baked coconutty vegetable curry

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the curry has been cooking for 20-25 min, add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Stir your blanched peas and cultured coconut through the curry, then tear your mint and coriander leaves all over

Serve the oven-baked coconutty vegetable curry with the warmed pitta to the side for dipping

Dig in!
