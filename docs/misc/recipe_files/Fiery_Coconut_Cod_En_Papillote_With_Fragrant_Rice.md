![Step 1 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-1-1637071288224-x200.jpg)

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Wash your pak choi, trim off the roots and discard, then separate the leaves

Cut pieces of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper, then lay the pak choi leaves in the middle of 2 pieces of baking paper (doubling it up prevents any leakages) and add to a baking tray (or two!)

### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

### Step 3

Combine the chopped creamed coconut in a jug with your tamari soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a generous pinch of salt and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Mix until fully combined – this is your fiery coconut sauce

### Step 4

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Sprinkle the edamame beans over the pak choi, then top with half the sliced red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

### Step 5

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper up a little, then pour most of the fiery coconut sauce over the vegetables

Top with your cod fillet[s], then divide the remaining fiery coconut sauce evenly over each cod fillet

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper around the fish to form 1 sealed parcel per person, making sure to leave space between the top of the fish and the paper (this is to prevent sticking)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1637071318998-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 15 min or until the veg has softened and the fish is cooked through – this is your fiery coconut cod & vegetables

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1637071330245-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water, the lime leaf[ves] and a generous pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your fragrant rice

### Step 8

Serve the fiery coconut cod & vegetables over the fragrant rice

Pour the remaining fiery coconut sauce from the parcels over the fish and vegetables

Garnish with the remaining sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
