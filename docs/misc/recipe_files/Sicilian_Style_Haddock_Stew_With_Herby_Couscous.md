## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped sweet pointed pepper and tomato to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl with half your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!), a generous pinch of salt and 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Stir together, then cover and set aside – this is your herby couscous


### Step 5

Once the pepper is starting to soften, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground smoked paprika, tomato paste, remaining dried oregano and capers

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] <span class="text-danger">[</span>250ml] </span>boiled water and stir it all together


### Step 7

Add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the stew and and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Sicilian-style haddock stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Sicilian-style haddock stew with the herby couscous to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
