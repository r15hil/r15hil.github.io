## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 185g canned green lentils
- 400g finely chopped tomatoes
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs 
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 190g linguine
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 25g walnuts
- 10g basil
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 aubergine
- 1 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim the green stalk off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop into bite-sized pieces

Drain and rinse the green lentils


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the chopped onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, add the chopped aubergine and walnuts to a food processor and pulse for 5 secs or until roughly blitzed

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the blitzed aubergine & walnuts, half the dried oregano and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min until the aubergine has started to brown

Once browned, transfer to a large mixing bowl and reserve the pan

Tip: Transferring the mixture to a large bowl will help it cool down before shaping into balls!


### Step 4

Stir through the drained lentils, grated Italian hard cheese, panko breadcrumbs, juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Divide the mixture into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> and shape into balls (clean hands is the best way!) – these are your lemony aubergine balls

Add the lemony aubergine balls to a baking tray (drizzle the tray with olive oil to avoid sticking!) and put it in the oven to cook for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 5

While the aubergine balls are cooking, boil a full kettle

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the remaining chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the remaining chopped garlic and dried oregano and cook for 1 min further until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock with a good grind of black pepper and cook for 8-10 min or until reduced to a thick consistency – this is your tomato sauce

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 7

While the sauce thickens, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine and stir through a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the tomato sauce and lemony aubergine balls over the linguine

Tear over the basil leaves and sprinkle over the grated cheddar cheese

Enjoy!
