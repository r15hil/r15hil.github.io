### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and very roughly chop the brown onion[s]

Cut the red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly (like it hot? Keep the seeds in!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop the ginger, then peel and roughly chop the garlic

Chop the tomato[es] into wedges

### Step 3

Add the chopped onion, chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped chilli, curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your spicy madras paste

### Step 4

Chop the chicken breast portion[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

Boil half a kettle

### Step 5

Add the spicy madras paste and the tomato wedges to the chicken and cook for 3-4 min further

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1607348529933-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 10 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Roughly chop the coriander, including the stalks

Add half of the chopped coriander to the sauce (save some for garnish!) and stir it all together – this is your spicy chicken madras

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1607348541586-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the sauce is thickening, cut the cucumber[s] in half lengthways

Scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon and discard, then dice the cucumber[s]

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Combine the diced cucumber and chopped mint in a small bowl with the natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt – this is your cooling raita

### Step 8

Serve the spicy chicken madras over the basmati rice and dollop the cooling raita on top

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
