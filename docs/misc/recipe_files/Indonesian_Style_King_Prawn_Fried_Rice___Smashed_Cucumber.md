## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 3

Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and transfer it to a plate

Spread the cooked rice out evenly on the plate and set aside to cool


### Step 4

Add half your dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind together – this is your chilli salt

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, just mix the two together!


### Step 5

Trim your cucumber, then bash it several times with a rolling pin until broken

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Chop the smashed cucumber into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped smashed cucumber to a bowl with the chilli salt, toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, drain, then add your king prawns to the pan with the chopped ginger, garlic, spring onion and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Cook for 2-3 min, then add the cooled rice and soy sauce and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your Indonesian-style king prawn fried rice


### Step 7

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until cooked to your liking

### Step 8

Serve the Indonesian-style king prawn fried rice with the smashed cucumber to the side

Top the rice with a fried egg and drizzle the cucumber with any remaining dressing

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
