## Ingredients

- 11g beef stock mix
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 16g tomato paste
- 100g Brussels sprouts
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 250g British beef mince
- 8g Marmite 
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 broccoli
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Peel the potatoes and cut them into small bite-sized pieces

Chop the Brussels sprouts into quarters

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 10 min, then add the sprouts and cook for 2-3 min further or until everything is fork tender


### Step 2

Once the potatoes and sprouts are done, drain and return them to the pot

Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, carrot and garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and stir in the Marmite – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the vegetables have softened, add the beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Grate the cheddar cheese

Once the beef is browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a grind of pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened – this is your beef mixture


### Step 5

While the beef mixture thickens, return the drained potatoes and sprouts to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your sprout mash


### Step 6

Once thickened, transfer the beef mixture to an oven-proof dish

Top with the sprout mash and sprinkle over the grated cheddar

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your festive cottage pie


### Step 7

Whilst the pie is in the oven, reboil a kettle

Cut the broccoli into florets

Add the broccoli florets to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the festive cottage pie with the broccoli to the side and enjoy!
