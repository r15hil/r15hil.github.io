## Ingredients

- British chicken breast portion x0
- Feta (30g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Balsamic sun-dried tomato paste (30g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Parsley (5g)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with your dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your oregano potatoes


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Crumble your feta into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Combine the chopped garlic, crumbled feta and chopped parsley with your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your sun-dried tomato stuffing


### Step 4

Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the side of your chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Open the chicken out like a book and fill the pocket[s] with the sun-dried tomato stuffing, then press firmly to seal the chicken – this is your stuffed chicken


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the stuffed chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 6

Transfer the browned chicken to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear – this is your Cypriot-style stuffed chicken


### Step 7

Trim, then add your green beans to a pot and cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once tender, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt – these are your buttered green beans

### Step 8

Serve the Cypriot-style stuffed chicken with the oregano potatoes and buttered green beans to the side

Enjoy!
