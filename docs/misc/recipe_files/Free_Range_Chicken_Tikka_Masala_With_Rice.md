## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and grate your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the grated onion, chopped garlic and chopped ginger with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid, and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder and ground paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Increase the heat to high, add the chopped chicken and cook for 3-4 min further or until coated in all of the spices


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your tomato paste, chicken stock mix and maple syrup in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[350ml] </span>[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Add the tomato stock to the pan and reduce the heat to medium-high, then cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once done, add your clotted cream and cook for 1 min further or until melted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your free range chicken tikka masala

### Step 8

Serve the free range chicken tikka masala with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!
