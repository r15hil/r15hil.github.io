## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml<span class="text-purple"> [650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Add your orzo, sliced leek and chopped garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the orzo in butter


### Step 4

Add the stock, your Chinese rice wine and bay leaf[ves] to the pan with your orzo

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking


### Step 5

While the orzo is cooking, chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Season your salmon fillet[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 6

When the orzo has 6 min left, return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, sprinkle in your dried oregano, then add the seasoned salmon fillet[s] and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your oregano salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the orzo is ready, remove it from the heat and stir through the chopped dill with a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your prasorizo-style dill orzo

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

### Step 8

Serve the prasorizo-style dill orzo topped with the oregano salmon and the salad to the side

Sprinkle over the toasted pine nuts and garnish with a lemon wedge

Season with a grind of black pepper and a small drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
