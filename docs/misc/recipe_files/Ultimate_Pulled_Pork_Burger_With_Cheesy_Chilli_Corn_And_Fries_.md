### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish, draining away half of the juices

Add your ketchup, half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and your ground cumin to the dish

Cover with tin foil and place the dish on a baking tray

### Step 2

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper and seal the foil tightly around them

Add the foil-wrapped cobettes to a baking tray with the pulled pork and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, the remaining ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries

### Step 4

Chop your chives finely

Combine your mayo with the chopped chives, half your cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a grind of black pepper in a bowl – this is your ranch dressing

### Step 5

After an initial 20 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil covering the pulled pork

Pull the BBQ pulled pork apart using two forks (this technique is known as ‘pulling) and mix everything through the juices

Return the dish to the oven for 8-10 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed, the pork has started to crisp and the corn is tender – this is your BBQ pulled pork and roasted sweetcorn cobettes

### Step 6

Chop your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with the remaining cider vinegar and a pinch of sugar – this is your quick-pickled chilli

Set aside for a couple of minutes, then drain the quick-pickled chilli, discard the liquid then return to the bowl and mix with your feta – this is your feta & quick-pickled chilli

### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and remove 1 of the outer leaves per person, then chop the remaining lettuce into quarters

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half, then add to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Sandwich the BBQ pulled pork, an outer lettuce leaf and some ranch dressing between your toasted brioche halves with your smoky fries, roasted sweetcorn cobettes and lettuce quarters to the side

Drizzle the remaining ranch dressing over the lettuce quarters and top with your crispy onions, then spread your feta & quick-pickled chilli over the roasted sweetcorn cobettes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
