## Description

Turkish flatbreads a.k.a. 'Lahmacun' is a thin flatbread, layered with minced meat and warm spices. We can't get enough of these babies. So in honour of some of our favourite Turkish joints surrounding Gousto HQ, we've created our own version. Ours has the addition of tahini paste and is topped with a fresh courgette, feta and parsley salad.
