## Description

Salade niçoise (French pronunciation: ​[ni' swaz]) is traditionally presented as a composed salad of tomatoes, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies, dressed with a vinaigrette. The Gousto version uses our locally sourced British mackerel and a punchy vinaigrette for a hearty and healthy dinner salad. Nice-oise!
