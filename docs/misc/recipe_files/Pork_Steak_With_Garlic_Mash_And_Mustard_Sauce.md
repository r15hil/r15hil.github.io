## Ingredients

- British pork loin steaks (300g)
- British pork loin steak (150g) x0
- Sugar snap peas (80g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Carrot
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces, then peel your garlic

Add the chopped potatoes and peeled garlic to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned pork loin steak[s] and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through

Reboil a kettle


### Step 3

Trim, then slice your sugar snap peas in half

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons

Add the sliced sugar snaps and carrot batons to a pot, cover them with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until tender, then drain and return to the pot until serving


### Step 4

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, red wine vinegar, wholegrain mustard and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your mustard stock


### Step 5

Once the pork steak is cooked through (no pink meat!), transfer them to a chopping board or shallow plate, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest until serving

Reserve the pan and any pork juices for the next step


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the mustard stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min

Increase the heat to medium-high, add a knob of butter and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened to creamy consistency

Once thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the reserved pork juices – this is your mustard sauce


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes & garlic cloves to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic mash

### Step 8

Serve the pork loin steak over the mustard sauce with the sugar snap peas, carrot batons and garlic mash to the side

Enjoy!
