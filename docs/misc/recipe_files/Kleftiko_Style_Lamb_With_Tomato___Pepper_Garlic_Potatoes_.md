## Description

Our take on the classic Greek roast would be the talk of the taverna. You’ll cook juicy lamb leg with a herby Mediterranean seasoning before letting the oven work its magic. Serve with saucy tomato and pepper garlic potatoes and a sprinkle of parsley.

## Ingredients

- Lamb leg joint (300g)
- Mediterranean-style seasoning (3g) (3g)
- Red onion
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Garlic clove x4
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Parsley (5g)
- Red pepper
- White potato x4
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil half a kettle, then take your lamb out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes, chop them into bite-sized pieces and add them to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork, put the bowl in the microwave for 5-6 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks


### Step 3

Dissolve your tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [250ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[380ml] </span>boiled water with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato stock

Cut a piece of baking paper (or two!), double the length of a baking tray

Add the baking paper to the baking tray[s], leaving enough excess to fold over on itself to form a parcel


### Step 4

Add the microwaved potatoes, chopped pepper, onion wedges, cherry tomatoes and peeled garlic to the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil, a small knob of butter dotted all over and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Pour the tomato stock all over the vegetables, sprinkle over 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Divide all the ingredients equally between the 2 trays!


### Step 5

Fold the baking paper over the top scrunching it together to form one big parcel in the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 35 min or until the potatoes are completely softened and saucy

Once completely cooked, mix everything together, being careful not to rip the baking paper – these are your tomato & pepper garlic potatoes


### Step 6

Meanwhile, remove the string from your lamb leg joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rub the lamb leg joint[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and season with your Mediterranean-style seasoning and a generous pinch of salt


### Step 7

Add the seasoned lamb to a separate baking tray with the halved lemon, cut side up, and cook for 25 min or until the lamb is cooked through and very slightly pink inside

Tip: Prefer no pink meat? Cook your lamb for 3-5 min longer!

Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board to rest for 3 min before slicing – this is your kleftiko-style lamb

Slice the rested lamb finely

### Step 8

Serve the tomato & pepper garlic potatoes with the sliced kleftiko-style lamb to the side

Squeeze the roasted lemon juice over the top (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
