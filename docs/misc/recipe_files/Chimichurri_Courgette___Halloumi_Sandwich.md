### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and your ground smoked paprika

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min

### Step 2

Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Roughly chop the remaining courgette

### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

### Step 4

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped courgette

Give everything a good mix up, then return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 15-20 min further or until the potatoes and courgette are crisp and golden – these are your smokey potatoes & courgette

### Step 5

Grind half your red wine vinegar, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, diced shallot, chopped parsley, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a pestle & mortar – this is your chimichurri

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!

Combine the courgette ribbons and the chimichurri in a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your chimichurri courgette

### Step 6

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 leaf per person and set aside

Chop the inner core into quarters, lengthways

Combine your mayo and remaining chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a small splash of water – this is your garlic sauce

Slice your halloumi in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1682590682194-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are nearly ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the halloumi is browned

<span class="text-danger">Ordered extra halloumi? Slice and cook in a pan with a little oil for 4-6 min or until golden all over</span>

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

### Step 8

To build, top your toasted ciabatta base with a reserved lettuce leaf, the chimichurri courgette, the browned halloumi and the toasted ciabatta lid – this is your chimichurri courgette & halloumi sandwich

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side with a small drizzle of olive oil and the remaining red wine vinegar

Serve the smokey potatoes & courgette to the side, then drizzle over the garlic sauce and enjoy!
