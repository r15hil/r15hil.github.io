- British lamb mince (250g)

- Curry powder (0.5tbsp) x0
- Cumin seeds (1tsp)
- Green chilli

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips


### Step 2

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Add the chips to the baking tray (or two!) with your cumin seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your cumin chips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 5

Once the lamb has slightly browned, add your curry powder, garam masala, half the chopped tomato, half the diced onion (save the rest for later!) and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has started to soften


### Step 6

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your tomato paste and ginger & garlic paste with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water to the pan

Cook for a further 4-5 min or until the curry has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fragrant lamb curry


### Step 7

Add the remaining chopped tomato, diced onion and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and toss – this is your chilli tomato salad

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant lamb curry with the cumin chips and chilli tomato salad to the side

Enjoy!
