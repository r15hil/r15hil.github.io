## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Sliced prosciutto (52g)
- Quinoa (70g)
- Balsamic sun-dried tomato paste (30g)
- Basil (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Soft goats' cheese (75g)
- Gem lettuce
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Sweet potato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender


### Step 2

While the quinoa is cooking, peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into rounds

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 3

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper

Add the sweet potato rounds and onion wedges to the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until everything's slightly softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a crack of black pepper and a pinch of sugar – this is your sun-dried tomato & balsamic dressing

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Once the quinoa is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and stir through the remaining sun-dried tomato paste and chopped garlic – this is your sun-dried tomato & balsamic quinoa


### Step 6

Once the sweet potato and onion have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push the veg to one side

Add the sun-dried tomato & balsamic quinoa to the other side and spread it out evenly

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min or until the veg is completely tender and the quinoa is crunchy – this is your roasted veg & crunchy quinoa


### Step 7

While everything's in the oven, tear your sliced prosciutto into strips

Crumble your goats' cheese into bite-size pieces

### Step 8

Serve the shredded lettuce in a bowl topped with the roasted veg & crunchy quinoa

Sprinkle over the crumbled goats' cheese and prosciutto strips and tear over your basil

Drizzle over the balsamic & sun-dried tomato dressing

Enjoy!
