## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and thinly slice

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper, chopped spring onion and halved green beans to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ginger & garlic paste to a bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> water and your cornflour and mix until smooth – this is your spicy stir-fry sauce


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have softened, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for an initial 5-6 min


### Step 6

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

After an initial 5-6 min, add the spicy stir-fry sauce to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your spicy Korean-style jumbo prawn stir-fry

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 8

Serve the cooked rice topped with the spicy Korean-style jumbo prawn stir-fry

Sprinkle your shichimi togarashi all over (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
