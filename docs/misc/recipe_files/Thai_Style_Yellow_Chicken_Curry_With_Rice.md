## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Peel and roughly chop your garlic


### Step 2

Add the chopped shallot, garlic and ginger paste to a food processor with your ground turmeric, curry powder, a small splash of water and a pinch of salt

Blitz until smooth – this is your Thai-style yellow curry paste


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 5

Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown

Meanwhile, dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, chicken stock mix and fish sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Once the chicken has browned, add your Thai-style yellow curry paste to the pan and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the sliced carrot and coconut stock and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Whilst the chicken is cooking, slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your Thai-style yellow chicken curry

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style yellow chicken curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
