### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

### Step 3

Once hot, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the halved green beans and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5 min

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es]

Once the prawns have had 5 min, add half of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and the chopped tomato and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!

### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 6

Add your ground smoked paprika, warmed rice and vegetable stock to the pan and cook for a further 3 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your smoky Spanish-style king prawns & rice

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1635255415545-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, cut your lemon[s] into wedges and combine a squeeze of lemon juice with your mayo, the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon aioli

Add a squeeze of lemon juice into the pan and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Serve the smoky Spanish-style king prawns & rice and drizzle the lemon aioli all over

Garnish with a lemon wedge and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
