### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your walnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer them to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reboil half a kettle

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to thicken

Once starting to thicken, add your halved asparagus and a pinch of salt and a good grind of pepper and cook, covered, for a further 3-4 min or until the asparagus is tender

Once tender, add the drained linguine to the pan with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until the pasta is fully coated – this is your mushroom & asparagus linguine

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom & asparagus linguine with the salad to the side and season with a good grind of pepper

Add a small squeeze of lemon juice over the salad

Garnish with the toasted walnuts and a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!
