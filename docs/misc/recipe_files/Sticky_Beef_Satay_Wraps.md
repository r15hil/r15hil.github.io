### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Spoon off and discard any excess fat that may come out of the meat!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(no need to peel!)

### Step 4

Once the mince has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste, honey, Chinese rice wine, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until the mince has caramelised and is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky beef

### Step 5

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice into batons

### Step 6

Whilst the mince is caramelising, add your tortillas to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 20 secs on high or until the tortillas are warmed through

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your peanut butter, chilli relish, remaining soy sauce, the juice of your lime[s], a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your satay sauce

### Step 8

Divide the sticky beef between the warmed tortillas and top with the grated carrots and cucumber batons

Drizzle over the satay sauce and garnish with your reserved chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
