## Description

Big, bold Cuban flavours have arrived in the form of this pork & orange stew. The mojo sauce is a Cuban staple â€“ orange juice & lime give a distinctively fresh, sweet flavour whilst romano peppers, oregano & olives add a savoury depth. Served with sunny turmeric rice & coriander. Cubamazing! (Naturally gluten-free, but unsuitable for coeliacs).

## Ingredients

- 1 Romano pepper
- 100g basmati rice
- 250g British pork mince
- 1 tbsp dried oregano 
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 5g coriander
- 1 orange 
- 30g pitted black olives
- 2 tsp ground cumin 
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 lime 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then add the basmati rice, ground turmeric, a generous pinch of salt&nbsp;and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


<span class="text-highlight">Remove</span> from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until it's softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Slice the&nbsp;<span class="text-highlight">R</span>omano pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rings, discarding the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and any seeds


### Step 4

Add the ground cumin and dried oregano&nbsp;to the softened onion and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


Add the pork mince and cook for 4-5 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water


Add the&nbsp;<span class="text-highlight">R</span>omano pepper, tomato paste and chopped garlic to the pork and cook for 1-2 min


Add the chicken stock and cook for 8-10 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a chilli-like consistency


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Meanwhile, zest 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> orange and 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)


Roll the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the black olives to the pan


Squeeze&nbsp;the juice of the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (watch out for the pips!) and 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime directly into the pan and stir through the orange and lime zest&nbsp;&ndash; this is your Cuban&nbsp;Pork Stew


Cut the remaining lime into wedges


Stir the chopped coriander through the cooked&nbsp;rice

### Step 8

Serve the Cuban&nbsp;Pork Stew with the coriander rice to the side


Garnish with the reserved&nbsp;coriander leaves and a wedge of lime


Enjoy!
