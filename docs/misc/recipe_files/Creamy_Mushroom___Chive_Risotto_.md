- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Spring onion

- Garlic clove x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1 and boil a kettle

Trim and finely slice your spring onion[s] and chop your chives finely, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml<span class="text-purple"> [975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, roughly tear and crumble both your flat white and chestnut mushrooms directly into the pan

Cook over a high heat for 3-5 min or until starting to brown and caramelise – these are your caramelised mushrooms


### Step 3

Once done, transfer the caramelised mushrooms to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put in the oven to keep warm

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the sliced spring onion and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) with a knob of butter

Cook for 30 secs or until softened


### Step 4

Add your arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the butter

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until it's evaporated


### Step 5

Add 1/3 of the vegetable stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed

Add the remaining vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheese and clotted cream

Remove the caramelised mushrooms from the oven and add half to the pan (save the other half for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy mushroom & chive risotto

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if your risotto is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mushroom & chive risotto topped with the remaining caramelised mushrooms

Garnish with a sprinkle of the remaining chopped chives and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
