## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and grate your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until soft

Once soft, add the chopped ginger, grated garlic and your curry powder to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, your tamarind paste, vegetable stock mix and rice vinegar in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tamarind stock


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomato to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until soft


### Step 6

Once soft, add the tamarind stock to the pan and cook, on a medium-high heat, for 2-3 min until sauce has reduced to curry like consistency

Once reduced, add your haddock bites and cook, covered, for 3-4 min

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1 min or until they're warm and the fish is cooked through – this is your tamarind, haddock & pea curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the tamarind, haddock & pea curry with the brown rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
