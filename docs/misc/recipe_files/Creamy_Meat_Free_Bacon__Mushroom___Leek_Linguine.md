## Ingredients

- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Meat-free bacon lardons (60g)
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Linguine (100g) x0
- Garlic clove x3
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Leek
- Linguine (190g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your meat-free bacon lardons to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy

Once crispy, transfer the cooked meat-free bacon lardons to a clean plate and set aside, reserve the pan


### Step 2

Whilst the bacon is cooking, wash your leek[s] carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and sliced leek to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until everything is beginning to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock with a generous grind of black pepper


### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and add your crème fraîche and drained linguine

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy mushroom & leek linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mushroom & leek linguine topped with the crispy meat-free bacon lardons and grated cheese

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
