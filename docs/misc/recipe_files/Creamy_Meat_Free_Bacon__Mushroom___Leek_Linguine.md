Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your meat-free bacon lardons to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy

Once crispy, transfer the cooked meat-free bacon lardons to a clean plate and set aside, reserve the pan

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic
