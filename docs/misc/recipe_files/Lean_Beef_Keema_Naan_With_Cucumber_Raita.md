### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the base of your naan from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s], then combine the sliced shallot with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and cook for 5-6 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 6

Meanwhile, spread your mango chutney over your naan[s] then add to the warmed baking tray[s]

Top the naan[s] with the spiced lean beef mince

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 5-10 min or until golden – these are your lean beef keema naan[s]

### Step 7

While the naan[s] are in the oven, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add the grated cucumber, natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber raita

### Step 8

Serve the lean beef keema naan with a dollop of cucumber raita

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot

Enjoy!
