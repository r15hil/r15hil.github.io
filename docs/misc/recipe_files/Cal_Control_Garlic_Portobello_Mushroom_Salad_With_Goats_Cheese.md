## Ingredients

- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Mini cosberg lettuce
- Pomegranate molasses (15g)
- Soft goats' cheese (75g)
- Garlic clove
- Portobello mushrooms (150g)
- Yellow pepper
- Rocket (50g)
- Pumpkin seeds (15g)
- Red onion
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dice your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Combine the chopped garlic in a bowl with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your garlic butter

Spread the garlic butter evenly over your portobello mushroom[s] and add to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)


### Step 3

Add the diced potato and pepper wedges to the other side of the baking paper-lined baking tray[s]

Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with your dried oregano and a generous pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – these are your roasted pepper & potatoes and garlic portobello mushroom


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based dry pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, transfer the toasted pumpkin seeds to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 5

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 8-10 min or until softened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your salad and lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Roughly shred the lettuce

Combine half your balsamic vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) and pomegranate molasses in a large bowl, with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the salad and shredded lettuce to the bowl and toss – these are your dressed leaves


### Step 7

Once the onions are softened, add the remaining balsamic vinegar and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 1/2 tsp] </span>sugar to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until sticky and caramelised – these are your caramelised onions

### Step 8

Serve the dressed leaves at the bottom of the plate and layer over the roasted pepper & potatoes

Top with the caramelised onions and garlic portobello mushroom

Crumble over your goats' cheese

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!
