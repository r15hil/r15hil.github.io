### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper

Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a very generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the pork belly, fat side down and cook for 3-4 min or until coloured and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side

Line a baking tray with tin foil

Once the pork is done, transfer to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 40-45 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Whilst the pork is cooking, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Add a large knob of butter to a bowl with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water

Once the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot, panko breadcrumbs and dried sage to the bowl

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and set aside to absorb – this is your stuffing mixture

### Step 4

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add spoonfuls of the stuffing mixture to the other side of the tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is golden and crisp

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel, core and roughly chop your apple[s], discarding the core[s]

Add the chopped apple to a pot with a lid with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook, covered, over a medium heat for 10-12 min or until the apple has softened

Once cooked, add a knob of butter and mash until smooth – this is your apple sauce

### Step 6

Whilst the apple sauce is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Add the grated carrot and sliced spring onion to a bowl along with your white wine vinegar and give it all a good mix up – this is your carrot slaw

### Step 7

Slice your bread roll[s] in half and put in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Once the pork belly is cooked through, remove from the oven and slice into rough, bite-sized pieces on a clean board

### Step 8

Fill the warmed bread roll with the sliced pork belly and the stuffing mixture

Dollop over the apple sauce and serve the chips and carrot slaw to the side

Enjoy!
