## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Reboil a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a large pinch of sugar and salt

Cook for 5 min or until they've softened slightly


### Step 4

Drain and rinse your butter beans

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the spicy harissa stock, your butternut squash cubes and the drained butter beans to the pan

Cook, covered, for 15 min or until the squash is fork-tender – this is your spicy butternut squash, harissa & butter bean stew

Finely chop your parsley, including the stalks

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth
