### Step 1

Boil half a kettle and chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your basmati rice and chopped creamed coconut to a pot with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your coconut rice

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Peel and dice your shallot[s]

### Step 3

Drain your pineapple, reserving the pineapple juice for later

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small knob of butter and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar over a high heat and cook for 30 secs or until starting to melt

Add the pineapple rings to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further, turning once until charred and caramelised, then transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool – this is your caramelised pineapple

### Step 4

Carefully wipe the pan clean and return to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the pork is beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the chopped garlic, grated ginger and half of the diced shallot (save the rest for later!) with your ground paprika, ground allspice and chopped thyme and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once the caramelised pineapple has cooled, chop it finely and return it to the bowl with the remaining pineapple juice

Add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with the remaining shallot and half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pineapple salsa

### Step 8

Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the Caribbean-style pork

Serve the Caribbean-style pork with the coconut rice and pineapple salsa to the side
