- Parsnip
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s]

Top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] into small bite-sized pieces

Dice your waxy potatoes (skins on), then crush 2/3 of your garlic cloves (you'll use the rest later!) with the side of your knife (keeping the skins on)


### Step 2

Add the chopped carrot, parsnip, potato and crushed garlic to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the vegetables are tender and browned

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped shallot and garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until the shallot has softened, then add your dried sage and cook for a further 30 sec – this is your sage & onion butter


### Step 4

Dissolve half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Combine the chicken stock, panko breadcrumbs and the sage & onion butter in a bowl and set aside to cool and absorb the liquid


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to the baking tray with the vegetables for the last 10-12 min of cooking time


### Step 6

Reboil a kettle

Meanwhile, divide the sage & onion stuffing and shape into 1 stuffing ball per person

Add the stuffing ball[s] to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 10-12 min or until they're browned


### Step 7

Meanwhile, dissolve the remaining chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir for 30 secs

Stir in the chicken stock and Henderson's Relish and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the gravy has thickened

Once cooked, remove the chicken and slice finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced free range chicken and gravy with the roast vegetables and sage & onion stuffing ball

Enjoy!
