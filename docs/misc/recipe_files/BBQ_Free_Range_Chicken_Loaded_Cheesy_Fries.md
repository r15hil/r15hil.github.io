### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until starting to crisp

### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Whilst the fries are cooking, peel and finely slice most of your red onion[s] and finely dice the rest

Tip: Slice it all for the next step if you don't like raw onion!

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sprinkle over the ground smoked paprika

Cook for 3 min on each side or until the chicken is starting to brown and the onion has softened

### Step 6

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with your BBQ sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your BBQ pulled chicken

### Step 7

Once the fries have started to brown, carefully dab any excess oil with kitchen paper

Push the fries into 1 pile per person, and top with the BBQ pulled chicken and grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your BBQ free range chicken loaded cheesy fries

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ free range chicken loaded cheesy fries and spoon your soured cream over

Top with the diced tomato and remaining diced onion

Enjoy!
