### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a full kettle

Chop half your leek[s] in half lengthways (you'll use the rest later!), wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until the leek has slightly softened

### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and slice the remaining leek into rounds and wash thoroughly to remove any grit, then shake off any excess water

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water

### Step 4

Once the sliced leek has slightly softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

### Step 5

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!

### Step 6

Once the risotto has been cooking for 5-8 min, add the leek rounds to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until slightly charred and tender – these are your roasted leek rounds

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through your soft cheese, wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!), half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy leek & mustard risotto

### Step 8

Serve the creamy leek & mustard risotto topped with the roasted leek rounds

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
