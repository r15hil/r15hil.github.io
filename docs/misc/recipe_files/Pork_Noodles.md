- 1 tbsp 5 spice
- 2 garlic cloves 
- 200g thai rice noodles
- 3 soy sauce sachets

## Instructions


### Step 1

Soak the Thai rice noodles in a container of cold water (so they're fully submerged)


Set aside to soften slightly until step 6


Boil&nbsp;a kettle


### Step 2

Pat the steaks dry with kitchen towel and trim off any excess fat with a sharp knife


Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil to a plate with the 5 spice mix


Season with salt to your taste


Stir the spice into the oil, then, with clean hands, coat the steaks evenly on both sides


### Step 3

Wash the spinach for step 7


Peel and grate (or finely chop) the garlic


### Step 4

Combine the soy sauce, honey, sesame oil and chopped garlic


Set aside until step 7


Chop or bash (in the bag with a rolling pin or in a pestle and mortar) the peanuts coarsely&nbsp;


### Step 5

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) on a high heat


When hot, add the steaks to the dry pan and cook on each side for 3 min, or until cooked through


Once cooked, transfer them to a clean board and cover with a tea towel to rest until serving&nbsp;


Reserve the pan for the next step


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat


Add the drained noodles and 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> of boiled water&nbsp;


Add a lid and cook on a medium heat for 1-2 min, or until the noodles have just softened


Tip: Shake the pan occasionally to prevent sticking


### Step 7

Remove the lid, add the spinach and stir to wilt it in the heat


Meanwhile, slice the steaks thinly


Once the spinach has wilted, remove from the heat and stir in the rested meat juices and the soy sauce mixture&nbsp;


Season to your taste

### Step 8

Serve the noodles with the sliced pork and peanuts scattered over the top


Enjoy!
