## Description

In Creole cooking there is something called 'The Holy Trinity'. This consists of onions, peppers and celery, the base for much of the regional cajun cuisines of Louisiana. Here it is used as the flavour foundation for one of our favorites - Dirty Rice!

### Step 1

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly


Chop the celery roughly


Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-size pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid (preferably non-stick) with 1&nbsp;tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high&nbsp;heat

Crumble in the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and mix very thoroughly with clean hands


### Step 5

Add the beef mixture to the pan&nbsp;and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up as you go


Meanwhile, chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the rice is cooked, add it to the pan


Save a couple pinches of parsley for garnish and add the rest to the pan


Stir thoroughly&nbsp;to combine the flavours - this is your dirty rice
