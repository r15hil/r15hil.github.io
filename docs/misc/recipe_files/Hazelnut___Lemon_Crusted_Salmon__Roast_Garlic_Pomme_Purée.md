### Step 1

Roast the garlic 


Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7.


Cut a piece of tin foil (or baking paper) approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper. Add the garlic cloves (skins on) to the foil with a drizzle of olive oil.


Scrunch the edges of the foil together to form a sealed parcel and add the parcel to a baking tray.<br /><br />Put the tray in the oven for an initial 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Make the hazelnut crumb


Meanwhile, boil a kettle.


Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon.


Bash the hazelnuts&nbsp;into fine crumbs with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose them!).


Chop the dill finely, including the stalks.


Combine the&nbsp;chopped dill, bashed hazelnuts, lemon zest&nbsp;in a bowl. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;&ndash; this is your hazelnut&nbsp;crumb.

### Step 3

Cook the potatoes 


Peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces.

### Step 4

Encrust the salmon


Once the garlic has had 5 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and add the salmon fillets.


Spread the Dijon mustard over the salmon and top with the&nbsp;hazelnut crumb.


Return&nbsp;the tray to the oven for a further 10-12 minutes or until the crumb is&nbsp;golden and the salmon is cooked through &ndash; this is your hazelnut-crusted&nbsp;salmon.


Tip: your fish is cooked when it flakes easily.
