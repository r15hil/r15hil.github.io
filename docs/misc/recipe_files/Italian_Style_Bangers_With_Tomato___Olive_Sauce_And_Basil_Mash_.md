## Ingredients

- 60g black olives
- 2 tomatoes
- 32g tomato paste
- 6 Proper Porker sausages
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 3 white potatoes
- 10g basil
- 150g spring greens
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the sausages to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through

Whilst the sausages are cooking, peel and finely slice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of sugar and salt

Cook for 3 min, then reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

Boil a full kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Tear the basil into a pestle & mortar and grind to a paste – this is your basil paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes with half the chopped garlic to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Meanwhile, chop the black olives coarsely and dice the tomatoes


### Step 5

Once the onions have caramelised, add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano and Henderson's Relish with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Season with a little pinch of salt and cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until the tomatoes have started to break down and the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add the chopped black olives – this is your tomato & olive sauce


### Step 6

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, roll the leaves up and slice into thin strips and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Heat a separate, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and remaining chopped garlic and cook for 1 min, then add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until tender


### Step 7

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth

Add the basil paste to the mash and give it a good mix up – this is your basil mash

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the sausages over the basil mash with the garlicky greens and tomato & olive sauce to the side

Enjoy!
