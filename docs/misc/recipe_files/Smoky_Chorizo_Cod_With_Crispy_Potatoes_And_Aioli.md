### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with half of your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half of your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Drizzle everything with vegetable oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Once the potatoes have been cooking for an initial 10 min, add the onion wedges and chopped pepper to the tray[s]

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min further or until everything has softened and the potatoes are crispy

### Step 3

While the veg is cooking, pat your cod fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the cod to a bowl with the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), remaining ground smoked paprika and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate – this is your smoky cod

### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper thoroughly

### Step 5

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a bowl with your mayo and the juice of half your lemon[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your aioli

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the smoky cod and your diced chorizo and season with a pinch of salt

Cook the fish for 4-5 min on each side until the fish is cooked through and the chorizo is crispy – this is your smoky chorizo cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once the pan is hot, add the shredded kale and cook for 3-4 min or until wilted and season with a pinch of salt

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy potatoes, roasted onion and roasted pepper over the kale

Top with the smoky chorizo cod and drizzle the aioli all over

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
