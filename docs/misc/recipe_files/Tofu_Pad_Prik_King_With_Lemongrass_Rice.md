### Step 1

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s] and garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the softer inner core[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 2

Add the chopped shallot, garlic, ginger, chopped lemongrass and coriander to a food processor with your ground paprika, cracked black pepper, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and blitz to a paste – this is your fiery curry paste

### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and the outer lemongrass layers and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and stir vigorously for 1 min, then cover and cook for 12-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and discard the outer lemongrass layers – this is your lemongrass rice

### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu in half lengthways, then slice into 8<span class="text-danger"> </span>pieces per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the tofu pieces with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min, turning once halfway until golden and crisp

Separate the onion wedges into petals

### Step 6

Once the tofu is golden and crisp, transfer it to kitchen paper and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the halved green beans and onion petals and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften and lightly blister

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

### Step 7

Add your fiery curry paste with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant, then return the crispy tofu to the pan

Cook for 2 min further, stirring to coat everything in the paste – this is your tofu pad prik king
