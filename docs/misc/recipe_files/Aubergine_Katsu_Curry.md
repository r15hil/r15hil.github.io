### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and beat lightly with a fork

Add a small handful of flour to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up until all the breadcrumbs are coated in the oil

### Step 2

Trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice into 1.5cm thick rounds

Coat the aubergine rounds in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Add the coated aubergine rounds to a tin foil-lined tray and put in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp, golden and cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving
