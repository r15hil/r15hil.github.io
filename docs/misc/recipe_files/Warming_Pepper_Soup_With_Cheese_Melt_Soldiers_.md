## Ingredients

- 1 cheddar cheese
- 1 finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 finely chopped tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 mozzarella
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 peppers
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Chop your pepper[s] in half, deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large chunks

Peel your red onion[s] and roughly chop into wedges

Crush and peel your garlic


### Step 2

Combine the chopped pepper, red onion wedges and crushed garlic in a mixing bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Just add a little!) and mix well

Season to taste with salt and pepper – this is your seasoned veg

Transfer the seasoned veg to a baking tray (save the bowl for later!) and put in the oven for 20-25 min or until soft and beginning to char


### Step 3

While the veg is roasting, boil a kettle

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock and your chopped tomatoes to a blender (or pan if using a (stick) blender) – this is your tomato stock

Set aside until later


### Step 5

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Roughly chop the drained mozzarella

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the chopped mozzarella and grated cheese in the reserved bowl and season with salt and pepper


### Step 6

Spread both the inside and outside of each ciabatta half with butter, then sandwich the grated cheese between two slices – this is your cheese sandwich[es]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and once hot, add the cheese sandwich[es] and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (e.g. several cans) to the top pan and cook for 2-3 min per side, checking occasionally – this is your cheese melt[s]


### Step 7

Remove the tray of roasted vegetables from the oven, then add them to the tomato stock

Add in your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Blitz together until smooth, then add the blitzed soup to a pan over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Serve in bowls and season generously with salt and plenty of pepper – this is your warming pepper soup

### Step 8

Cut the cheese melt[s] into thirds lengthways – these are your cheese melt soldiers

Serve the cheese melt soldiers alongside the warming pepper soup

Drizzle the soup with olive oil and season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!
