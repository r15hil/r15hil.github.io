## Ingredients

- 250g tomato and mozzarella tortelloni
- 50g soft cheese
- 30g sun-dried tomatoes
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 15g flaked almonds
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 80g spinach
- 125g mozzarella
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the grill to medium-high and boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Roughly chop the sun-dried tomatoes


### Step 3

Add the sliced garlic and chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the pan and cook for 2-3 min

Add the flaked almonds to a baking tray and put the tray under the grill for 2-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tomato & mozzarella tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

While the pasta is cooking, wash the spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 6

Add the Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock mix, soft cheese and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100 ml]</span> boiled water to the pan with the sun-dried tomatoes, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce is starting to thicken

While the sauce is thickening, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the pasta sauce has thickened slightly, add the drained tomato & mozzarella tortelloni and chopped wilted spinach to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce â€“ this is your creamy sun-dried tomato sauce with mozzarella & tomato tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato sauce with mozzarella & tomato tortelloni with the drained mozzarella torn over the top

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
