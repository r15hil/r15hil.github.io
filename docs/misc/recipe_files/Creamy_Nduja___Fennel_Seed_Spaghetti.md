### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind (or chop if you don't have a pestle and mortar!) to a fine powder

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Add your spaghetti to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Once the tomatoes are beginning to soften, add the sliced garlic and crushed fennel seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs

### Step 5

Wash your spinach, then add to the pan along with your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up until fully combined and the spinach has wilted

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 3-4 min or until a sauce has formed

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel half your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks, keeping the stalks and leaves separate

### Step 7

Add the chopped basil stalks to the sauce with your soft cheese and stir it all together

Add the drained spaghetti with the grated Italian hard cheese and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy 'Nduja & fennel seed spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy 'Nduja & fennel seed spaghetti topped with the cheese shavings and chopped basil leaves

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
