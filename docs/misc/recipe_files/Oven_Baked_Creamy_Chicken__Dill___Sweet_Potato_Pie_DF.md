### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh to the dish with the cornflour and dried oregano and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned

### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Chop the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Once the chicken is very lightly browned add the chopped sweet potato, chicken stock mix, 100ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, single soya and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir everything together

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender

### Step 5

Once everything has been in the oven for 12 min, dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour

Roll out the puff pastry to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and add to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need 2 trays!

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden — this is your pie lid

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the dish from the oven and stir through the blanched peas, chopped parsley and half <span class="text-danger">[all] </span>of the wholegrain mustard

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the rest of the mustard for another meal!

Top with the pie lid — this is your creamy chicken, parsley & sweet potato pie

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken, parsley & sweet potato pie

Let everyone dig in!
