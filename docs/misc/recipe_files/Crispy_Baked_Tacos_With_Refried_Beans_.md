### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Curl your tortillas into a 'U'-shape and add them to an oven-proof dish (or two)

Drizzle the tortillas with olive oil and put the dish[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 5 min or until the tortillas are beginning to crisp

Once done, remove them from the oven and set aside – these are your crispy tortillas

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your black beans

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and drained black beans and cook for 30 secs

### Step 3

Add your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 1 min – these are your spicy beans

Add your chopped tomatoes and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water to the spicy beans and cook for 5-8 min or until the sauce has thickened

### Step 4

While the sauce thickens, chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your pineapple rings roughly (reserve the juice!)

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Once the sauce has thickened, remove the spicy beans from the heat, squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s] and mix to combine

Gently crush the beans with a masher a few times – these are your refried beans

### Step 6

Divide the refried beans between the crispy tortillas and return the dish[es] to the oven for a further 5 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy baked tacos

### Step 7

While the tacos are in the oven, combine the chopped cherry tomatoes, chopped pineapple, chopped coriander and sliced spring onion in a bowl

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of the reserved pineapple juice, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your pineapple salsa

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Top the crispy baked tacos with the pineapple salsa

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
