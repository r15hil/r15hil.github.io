## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your potato[es] to a large baking tray and prick a few times with a sharp knife

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 60 min or until cooked through and crisp


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and Henderson's Relish – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 3

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Note: Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Add the onion wedges, tomato wedges, drained cannellini beans, ground smoked paprika and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the dish, then add the tomato stock and bring to the boil


### Step 4

Add your BBQ pulled pork and any juices to the dish and give everything a gentle mix up until the pork is covered in the stock

Put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 35-40 min or until everything is cooked through and tender


### Step 5

While everything's cooking, wash your lettuce and chop into wedges, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your chives finely


### Step 6

Combine your white wine vinegar with half of your soured cream, half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!), a pinch of salt and pepper and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your creamy dressing

While the BBQ pork is cooking, use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once everything is cooked through, remove the casserole dish from the oven and pull the pork apart, using two forks (or keep it in bigger chunks if you prefer!) – this is your smoky pulled pork & beans

### Step 8

Cut your jacket potato in half (careful – it will be hot!), add a knob of butter, then load on the smoky pulled pork & beans

Top with the remaining soured cream and remaining chopped chives then season with a grind of black pepper

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side and drizzle over the creamy dressing

Enjoy!
