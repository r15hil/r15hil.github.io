## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Add your lamb mince to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the mince and shape into 3 meatballs per person


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2 min on each side, turning occasionally, then transfer them to a plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium-low heat, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until they're softened and caramelised


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has caramelised, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil to the pan

Increase the heat to high and add your garam masala and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add most of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and all of the chopped ginger and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, return the meatballs to the pan and add the tomato stock, tomato wedges, your mango chutney and a very generous pinch of pepper, then reduce the heat to medium-high

Cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the sauce resembles a curry-like consistency and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lamb meatball rogan josh


### Step 7

While the meatballs are cooking, heat a small pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your yellow mustard seeds and cook for 1 min or until they begin to pop

Trim, then add your green beans, a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of water and cook covered for 3-4 min, then add the remaining chopped garlic for a final 1 min – these are your mustard seed green beans

### Step 8

Serve the lamb meatball rogan josh with the basmati rice and the mustard seed green beans to the side

Enjoy!
