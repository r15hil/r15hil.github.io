## Description

Anchovies, olives, capers, garlic and chilli pack a real punch in our puttanesca. You'd normally combine this classic tomato sauce with pasta but weâ€™ve swapped the spaghetti for Arborio rice and turned it into a risotto that's filled with the same gutsy flavours. AND you only need one pan to make it!
