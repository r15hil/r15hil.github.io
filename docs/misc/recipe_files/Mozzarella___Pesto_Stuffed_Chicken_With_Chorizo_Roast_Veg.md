## Ingredients

- Diced chorizo (100g)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Sun-dried tomato pesto (45g)
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove x2
- Parsley (5g)
- Red pepper
- Tomato
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and slice finely


### Step 3

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of your chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Stuff the chicken pocket[s] with your sun-dried tomato pesto and sliced mozzarella


### Step 5

Add the stuffed chicken to an oven-proof dish and scatter round your diced chorizo, tomato wedges, pepper strips and sliced garlic

Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with your ground smoked paprika and a pinch of pepper


### Step 6

Put the dish in the oven for 22-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is beginning to char – this is your mozzarella & pesto stuffed chicken with chorizo roast veg


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the mozzarella & pesto stuffed chicken with chorizo roast veg with the crispy potatoes to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
