## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]


### Step 2

Add your lamb mince to a large bowl with your chopped shallot, ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 2/3 of your tamarind paste and 2/3 of your soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up (clean hands are the best way!) – this is your murtabak filling


### Step 3

Add 1 roti per person to a baking tray (or two!)

Divide the murtabak filling between the roti[s], evenly covering the roti[s] and spreading the filling almost to the edges


### Step 4

Top the filled roti[s] with the remaining roti[s], then a piece of baking paper

Top each tray of roti[s] with another baking tray (this will help to keep them flat during cooking)

Put the trays in the oven and cook for 15-18 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Malaysian-style lamb murtabak


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then chop roughly


### Step 7

Combine your sambal oelek with half your rice vinegar, the remaining tamarind paste and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Add 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 1/2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir it all together – this is your sambal oelek sauce

### Step 8

Cut each Malaysian-style lamb murtabak into quarters and serve with the sambal oelek sauce, basmati rice and chopped cucumber to the side

Drizzle the remaining rice vinegar and remaining soy sauce over the cucumber

Enjoy!
