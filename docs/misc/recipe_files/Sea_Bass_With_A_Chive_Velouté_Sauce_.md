## Description

This elegant sea bass dish is served with a velouté, pronounced 'vel-oo-tey' - a classic French sauce which translates to 'velvet' because of its smooth finish. Despite the fancy name, it's actually really easy to make. Served with mini hasselback potatoes and some French-style Tenderstem broccoli and spring onions. Ooh la la c'est magnifique!

## Ingredients

- 80g Tenderstem broccoli 
- 2 sea bass fillets 
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine 
- 5g fresh chives
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 1/2 vegetable stock cube
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 3 spring onions 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) into the skin of the waxy&nbsp;potatoes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base - these are your hasselback potatoes


Tip: rest the potatoes on to a wooden spoon when cutting, it will prevent you from cutting all the way through the potato!


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Boil a kettle


Add the hasselback&nbsp;potatoes to an oven tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!), drizzle each with olive oil and season with salt and pepper


Place in the oven for 30-35 min or until they're tender and starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[1]</span>&nbsp;vegetable&nbsp;stock cube in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a measuring jug


Add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span>&nbsp;butter to a pot over a medium heat


Once melted, add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span>&nbsp;flour and stir for 2-3 min until a sandy coloured paste is formed - this is your roux


### Step 4

Add the Shaoxing wine to the roux and cook for 30 sec


Stir the vegetable&nbsp;stock gradually into the roux&nbsp;


Whisk constantly for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains


Add the clotted cream, season with pepper and remove from the heat - this is your&nbsp;velout&eacute; sauce


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Trim, then chop each spring onions in half&nbsp;


Chop the chives finely


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the spring onions and Tenderstem broccoli&nbsp;with a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt


Cook for 5 min or until the spring onions are starting to caramelise, then transfer the vegetables to a sheet of tin foil&nbsp;&amp; wrap to seal the package


Put the foil package in the oven until serving&nbsp;


### Step 7

Return the same pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Pat the&nbsp;sea bass&nbsp;dry and season the skin generously with salt


Once the pan is hot, place the sea bass, skin-side down, and cook for 4 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for a further 1 min


Tip: try not to move the fish around the pan, as this will prevent it from crisping up

### Step 8

Return the velout&eacute; sauce to a medium heat for 1 min to warm through and stir in the chopped&nbsp;chives


Serve the sea bass with the hasselback potatoes, vegetables and velout&eacute;&nbsp;sauce&nbsp;


Enjoy!
