### Step 2

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 3

Reboil half a kettle

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a separate pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic and cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

### Step 4

Add your balsamic vinegar and dried oregano and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly

Once the sauce has thickened, press down on your cherry tomatoes to release the juice – this is your balsamic tomato sauce

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>flour to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Coat your hake fillet[s] in the flour, pressing firmly to coat them evenly

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once very hot, add the coated fish and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and the chopped basil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your basil mash

### Step 8

Serve the golden hake over the basil mash with the balsamic tomato sauce drizzled over the top

Garnish with the remaining basil leaves

Season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
