### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Take 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> butter out of the fridge and set aside to warm up

### Step 3

Add the halved Tenderstem broccoli and onion wedges to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender, golden and crisp – this is your roasted veg

### Step 4

While the veg is cooking, combine your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste with the softened butter, lemon zest and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Tip: If your butter is not soft then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your sun-dried tomato butter

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your mayo, remaining garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your aioli

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1682082777988-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the prawns are nearly cooked through

### Step 7

Once nearly cooked through, add the sun-dried tomato butter to the pan and swirl the pan around until the butter has melted and is foaming

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Cook for 1-2 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your Spanish-style king prawns

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy potatoes topped with the Spanish-style king prawns

Serve the roasted veg to the side and drizzle the aioli all over

Top with your crispy onions and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
