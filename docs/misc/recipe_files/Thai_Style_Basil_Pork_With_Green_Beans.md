## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 3

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped green beans to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] ( just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you’re cooking two packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 5

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Combine the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger paste, roasted garlic paste, hoisin sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce in a small bowl – this is your fragrant sauce


### Step 6

Add the fragrant sauce to the pan and cook for 30 secs


### Step 7

Add a small splash of water and cook for a further 4 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, rip your basil leaves into the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai-style basil pork with green beans

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style basil pork with green beans with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
