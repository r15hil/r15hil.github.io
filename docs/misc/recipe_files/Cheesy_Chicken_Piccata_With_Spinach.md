## Ingredients

- 150g baby leaf spinach
- 40g mature cheddar 
- 200g linguine 
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1 British free-range egg
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 British chicken breast fillet 
- 15g capers
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Grate the mature&nbsp;cheddar&nbsp;finely


Add a handful of flour to a plate


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork


Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate and combine with the grated cheese&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Place your hand flat on the&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces of&nbsp;chicken


Coat the chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add it into the beaten egg and finally press it firmly into the cheesy&nbsp;breadcrumbs&nbsp;to evenly coat all over


Refrigerate until step 5&nbsp;


### Step 3

Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the linguine


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, re-boil a kettle<br /><br />Peel and finely slice the garlic&nbsp;


Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Cut half the lemon into wedges and reserve for garnish


Dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;breaded chicken&nbsp;and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through


Tip: add more oil if your pan is looking a little dry&nbsp;


Once cooked, transfer the breaded chicken to kitchen paper (keep the pan!)


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat with a large knob of butter


Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to lightly brown&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Once lightly browned, add the capers, clotted cream and chicken stock and cook for 1-2 min&nbsp;


Wash the baby&nbsp;spinach, then add it to the pan&nbsp;and cook for 2 min further or until the spinach is wilted&nbsp;


Squeeze in&nbsp;the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and season with a generous grind of black pepper


Add the drained linguine to the pan and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Slice the breaded chicken&nbsp;


Serve the linguine,&nbsp;top with the sliced chicken and garnish with a wedge of lemon


Enjoy!
