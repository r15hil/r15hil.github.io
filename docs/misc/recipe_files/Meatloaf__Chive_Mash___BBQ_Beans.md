## Description

Forget the versions from school dinners past, we're going to show you how to make the perfect meatloaf. Deliciously succulent and fabulously flavoursome, the tomato ketchup glaze on ours gives the meatloaf a lovely sweetness, which works really well with the smoky beans and creamy mash. A+ for flavour!
