## Ingredients

- 3 mayonnaise sachets (45ml)
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 400g potatoes
- 5g mint 
- 2 cod fillets
- 15g capers
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges


Add the wedges to a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season generously with salt


Put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until the wedges are crispy and coloured


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Combine the mayonnaise with 2&nbsp;tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span>&nbsp;lemon juice (keep the rest for later) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil


Season with salt and pepper and set aside &ndash; this is your lemon mayo


### Step 3

Chop the sugar snap peas roughly


Heat a pot with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the sugar snaps, a knob of butter and a splash of water&nbsp;


Cover and cook for 3 min or until the peas have turned bright green


### Step 4

Meanwhile,&nbsp;strip the mint leaves from their stems, chop the leaves finely and set aside


Transfer the sugar snaps to a food&nbsp;processor with a little squeeze of the remaining lemon and a small pinch of salt and blitz into a mushy paste&nbsp;


Return the mushy&nbsp;sugar snap peas&nbsp;to the cooking pot and set aside&nbsp;


### Step 5

Pat the capers dry with kitchen paper


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, carefully add the capers and cook for 1-2 min until they have puffed up a little, then transfer them to kitchen paper with a slotted spoon and set aside until serving &ndash; these are your crispy capers


### Step 6

Only proceed to this step once your wedges are cooked...


Return the pan, with the remaining oil to a medium-high heat


Pat the cod&nbsp;dry and season with a little salt&nbsp;


Once&nbsp;the pan is hot, add the cod&nbsp;and cook for 2 min, flipping halfway through (your fish is cooked once it flakes easily)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the mushy sugar snap peas to a medium heat for 1 min to warm through


Once warmed, remove from the heat and stir in the chopped mint &ndash;&nbsp;these are your minted mushy sugar snaps


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the cod&nbsp;with the wedges&nbsp;and minted mushy sugar snaps to the side&nbsp;


Drizzle over the lemon mayo and scatter with crispy capers


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for a garnish and enjoy!
