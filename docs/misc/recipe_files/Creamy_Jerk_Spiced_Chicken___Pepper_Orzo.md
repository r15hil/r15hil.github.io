## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 6 min or until beginning to brown


### Step 3

While the chicken is browning, add your orzo to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orzo for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite


### Step 4

Once done, drain the orzo

Reserve 50m<span class="text-purple">l [65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [85ml]</span> starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Peel and grate your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 6

Once the chicken has slightly browned, add the chopped pepper and grated garlic and cook for 4 min or until softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once softened, stir through the drained orzo, double cream and chicken stock mix

Add your jerk paste with the reserved starchy pasta water and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy jerk spiced chicken & pepper orzo


### Step 8

Serve the creamy jerk spiced chicken & pepper orzo and grate your cheddar cheese over the top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
