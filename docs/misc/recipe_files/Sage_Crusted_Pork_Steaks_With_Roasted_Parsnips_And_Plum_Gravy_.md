## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Slice your potato[es] (skins on) into discs, approx. 1cm thick

Slice your parsnip[s] (skins on) into discs, approx. 1cm thick

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 2

Add the potato discs, parsnip discs and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 3

Peel and grate (don't chop) your garlic

Add your dried sage, grated garlic and panko breadcrumbs to a small bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Give it a good mix up – this is your sage crumb


### Step 4

Top your pork loin steak[s] with the sage crumb

Tip: Press the crumb into the pork steaks firmly with your hands to help it stick!

Once the veg has had 20 min, add the sage-crusted pork steak[s] to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 13-15 min or until the crumb is golden and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 6

Cut a piece of tin foil per person approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper 

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle with a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the greens are tender


### Step 7

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock and your plum chutney and cook for 5-6 min until reduced to a gravy-like consistency – this is your plum gravy

### Step 8

Serve the sage-crusted roast pork steaks with the roasted potato, parsnip & onion and sliced spring greens to the side

Pour the plum gravy all over

Enjoy!
