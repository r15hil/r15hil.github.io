## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt 
- 1g whole cloves
- 32g tomato paste
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 2 plain naans
- 200g paneer
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 25g cashew nuts 
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Chop the paneer into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the garam masala and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped paneer and cook for 4-6 min or until charred slightly, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once done, set the spiced paneer aside and reserve the pan


### Step 3

While the paneer is cooking, add the cashew nuts to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 4

Peel and roughly chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop the ginger

Peel and roughly chop the garlic


### Step 5

Dice the cucumber finely

Add the diced cucumber to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with salt and pepper – this is your peppery cucumber salad

Drain the soaked cashews

Add the drained cashews, chopped ginger, garlic and red onion to a food processor and blitz to form a paste – this is your cashew paste


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the whole cloves and cook for 1-2 min

Add the cashew paste and the tomato paste and cook for 6-8 min or until fragrant and the onions have softened

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan looks a little dry

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 7

Once the onions have softened, add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>boiled water to the pan with the vegetable stock mix

Cook for 3-5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Once thickened, add the spiced paneer and natural yoghurt and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your creamy paneer makhani

Add the plain naans to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warm

### Step 8

Once hot, remove the warmed naans from the oven and add a knob of butter to each

Serve the creamy paneer makhani with the buttered naans and peppery cucumber salad to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cloves!

Enjoy!
