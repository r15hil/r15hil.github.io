Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 7-8 min or until browned

### Step 3

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot of boiling water over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until the noodles are cooked with a slight bite

### Step 4

Melt 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter in a small bowl in the microwave for 20 secs (gently heat in a pot if you don't have a microwave!)

Once melted, add your soy sauce, white miso paste, a pinch of sugar and the chopped ginger and garlic and whisk to combine – this is your miso-butter

### Step 5

Once the chicken is almost cooked, add the pepper strips, sliced mushrooms and mangetout to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the veg is slightly softened but still crunchy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Once slightly softened, add the miso-butter to the pan with the vegetables along with a splash of starchy noodle water and mix well

### Step 7

Add the juice of half your lime[s] and the drained noodles to the pan and give everything a really good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until everything is nicely coated in the sauce – this is your miso-butter chicken breast & vegetable noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the miso-butter chicken breast & vegetable noodles and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
