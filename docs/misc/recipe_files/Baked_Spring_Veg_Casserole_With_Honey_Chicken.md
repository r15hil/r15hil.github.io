### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 -10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to the dish

### Step 3

Top, tail and slice your leek[s] into rounds, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit

Add the sliced leek to the potatoes with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour, give everything a good mix up and cook for 30 secs

### Step 4

Add your chicken stock mix to the dish with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water, your Dijon mustard, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together and bring to the boil

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your chicken thighs (skin-side up) to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] on the bottom shelf of the oven for 25 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and the skin is crispy

### Step 6

At the same time, put the dish with the potatoes and leek into the oven, covered, for 25 min or until everything’s bubbling and the potatoes are almost tender

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through and crispy, remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle your honey all over – this is your honey chicken

Give the potatoes and leek a good mix up

Return both the honey chicken tray[s] and potatoes and leek to the oven for a final 5-7 min or until everything's tender and cooked through

### Step 8

To serve, cut the remaining lemon into approx. 1 wedge per person

Stir your blanched peas through the potatoes and leek – this is your baked spring veg casserole

Chop the honey chicken into thirds and serve over the top of the casserole

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Dig in!
