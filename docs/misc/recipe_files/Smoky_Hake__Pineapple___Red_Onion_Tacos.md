## Ingredients

- 0 mayonnaise
- 1 gem lettuce
- 2 hake fillets
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 0 ground smoked paprika
- 15ml soy sauce
- 0 dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 plain tortillas
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 5g coriander
- 2 garlic cloves
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 red onion
- 220g canned pineapple

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel your red onion[s] and slice rings off as finely as you can for per person, then dice the remaining onion

Add the onion rings and red wine vinegar to a shallow bowl and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled onion rings


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic to the softened onion and cook for 1 min further, then set aside until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, wash your gem lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and separate the outer leaves, then finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain and finely dice your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa


### Step 4

Chop your coriander as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and the chopped coriander in a bowl – this is your herby mayo


### Step 5

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake to a bowl with your soy sauce, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix until the hake is evenly coated – this is your coated hake


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your smoky hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Drain the quick-pickled onion rings and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Top your warmed tortillas with a dollop of herby mayo and the lettuce leaves

Fill the lettuce leaves with the softened onion, top with smoky hake, pineapple salsa and garnish with the quick-pickled onion rings – these are your smoky hake, pineapple & red onion tacos

Enjoy!
