### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Tip: Like it hot? Keep the seeds in!

### Step 2

Strip your coriander leaves and basil leaves from their stalks

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 3

Add the peeled garlic to a pestle & mortar with the coriander & basil stalks (the leaves will be used later!), chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and grind to form a rough paste – this is your chilli paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!

### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice and dried lime leaf[ves] to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 5

Add your Tenderstem broccoli and spinach to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Scrunch the foil around the vegetables to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite – these are your greens

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chilli paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, stirring frequently until fragrant

Boil half a kettle

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1687533556187-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your basa fillet[s] to the pan with your fish sauce, soy sauce and 70ml <span class="text-purple">[80ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [90ml] </span>boiled water

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked through, add your basil leaves – this is your Thai-style pad cha basa

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style pad cha basa over the fragrant rice with the greens to the side

Pour any remaining sauce from the pan over the basa

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!
