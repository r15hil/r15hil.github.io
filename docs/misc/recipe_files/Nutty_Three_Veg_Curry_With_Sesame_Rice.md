## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for 3 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: Try not to stir the mushrooms too often as this will stop them from caramelising!


### Step 3

While the mushrooms are softening, boil half a kettle

Chop your pepper[s] in half, deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Add the chopped pepper to the pan and cook for 2 min further


### Step 4

Meanwhile, trim, then roughly chop your spring onions

Add them to the pan and cook for 2 min further


### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your red Thai curry paste, peanut butter, chopped creamed coconut and soy sauce in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your nutty stock


### Step 6

Add your mangetout and nutty stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened – this is your nutty three veg curry


### Step 7

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the nutty three veg curry with the white long grain rice to the side

Garnish with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!
