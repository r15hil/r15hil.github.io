## Ingredients

- 1 can of sweetcorn (150g)
- 1 tomato
- 1 free from mayonnaise pot (45g)
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 can of green lentils (400g)
- 2 ciabatta rolls
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 1 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 1 chipotle paste sachet (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6

Boil half a kettle (you'll only use a tablespoon!)

Peel and chop the potatoes into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give them a good mix up and put them in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Dissolve the vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water - this is your vegetable stock

Drain and rinse the canned lentils

Drain the canned sweetcorn


### Step 3

Mash the drained lentils in a flat-bottomed bowl (a pot is perfect!) to form a smooth paste

Add half of the drained sweetcorn to the pot and mash again until they start to break up

Add the ras el hanout, vegetable stock, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix well until the breadcrumbs are fully combined


### Step 4

Divide the lentil & sweetcorn mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into patties


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the patties and remaining sweetcorn and cook the patties 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crisp and the sweetcorn is golden brown

Tip: You may need a second pan for the sweetcorn!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and free from mayonnaise – this is your chipotle mayonnaise


### Step 7

Add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> slices

### Step 8

Cut the warmed ciabatta rolls in half and top the base with the lentil burger and sliced tomato

Add a dollop of the chipotle mayo and a small handful of the baby leaf salad

Serve the chips and remaining baby leaf salad to the side

Add the sweetcorn to the salad, drizzle over the balsamic vinegar and enjoy!
