## Description

A pulled chicken salad is no meagre meal. It brings together warm chicken and homemade croutons, with crunch from the chopped apple, celery and little gem. A textural sensation; it's all wrapped up in a wholegrain mayonnaise dressing and topped with toasted almonds. (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).
