### Step 1

Before you begin...

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble your ultimate vegan burger patty[ies] into the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Add the sliced green chilli to a small bowl with the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli

Combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix in a large bowl with the juice of the remaining lime, the chopped coriander and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander slaw

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Divide the chipotle meat-free mix, coriander slaw and sriracha mayo evenly between the warmed tortillas and top with with the quick-pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)
