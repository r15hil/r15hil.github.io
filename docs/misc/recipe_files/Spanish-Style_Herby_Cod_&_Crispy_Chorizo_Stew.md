### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crisp

While the chorizo is cooking, boil a kettle

### Step 2

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges, then separate the onion wedges into petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Chop your waxy potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the chorizo is crisp, transfer it to a plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium-high heat and add the onion petals, pepper strips and chopped potatoes

Cook for 3-4 min or until the potatoes are starting to brown

When the potatoes have browned, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further

### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, add your cod fillet[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Lay on top 1 knob of butter per cod fillet, sprinkle over your dried oregano and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12 min or until the cod is cooked through – this is your Spanish-style herby cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Once the potatoes are tender, stir a large knob of butter and half of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) into the pan – this is your stew

### Step 8

Serve the Spanish-style herby cod over the stew

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and sprinkle over the crispy chorizo – this is your Spanish-style herby cod & crispy chorizo stew

Enjoy!
