### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with the nigella seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 3

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes

Combine the cornflour in a bowl with half the garam masala and half the curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and mix it all together

Add the cubed paneer to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the paneer is fully coated

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, remaining garam masala, remaining curry powder and tomato paste to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and the baked beans and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated paneer and cook for 5-6 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once done, transfer the golden paneer to a plate – these are your spiced paneer nuggets

### Step 7

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the beans have thickened, add the spinach to the pot and cook for 1 min further or until starting to wilt – these are your masala saag beans

### Step 8

Serve the spiced paneer nuggets with the chips and masala saag beans to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
