### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5- 10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Slice your sweet pointed pepper[s] into rings

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the onion wedges and sliced pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 4

Add your arborio rice, ground smoked paprika, saffron and half your roasted garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) to the dish and stir everything together

### Step 5

Add your chicken stock mix and tomato paste with 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until most of the water has absorbed, the rice and chicken are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one-pot chicken paella

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the remaining roasted garlic paste and mayo to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your roasted garlic aioli

### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

To serve, drizzle the roasted garlic aioli over the one-pot chicken paella

To garnish, chop your parsley roughly over the paella with scissors

Dig in!
