## Ingredients

- 11g beef stock mix
- 16g tomato paste
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 390g black beans
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 100g white long grain rice
- 20g chipotle paste
- 250g British beef mince
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion
- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chopped peppers with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, ground smoked paprika and half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the beef mince to the pan and cook for 2 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Mix in the beef stock mix and tomato paste with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 2 min or until the mince has browned all over


### Step 5

Add the white long grain rice, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), a pinch of salt and pepper and 175ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice and meat is cooked (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through the drained black beans and cook for a further 2 min or until the beans are warmed through – this is your Mexican-style beef, rice & beans

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style beef, rice & beans topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
