### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pierce your sweet potato[es] with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 5-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the softened sweet potato[es] to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the skin is crispy

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

### Step 3

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and curry powder and cook for 1-2 min

While the onion is softening, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste and stir it all together – this is your coconut stock

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Add the coconut stock and drained chickpeas and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach

Once the curry has thickened, add the wilted spinach and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your creamy chickpea curry

### Step 6

Once the potato[es] is cooked, add your cashew nuts to the tray and return it to the oven for a further 2-3 min or until the cashews are golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 7

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Cut the baked sweet potato in half, lengthways, and fill with the creamy chickpea curry

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted cashew nuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
