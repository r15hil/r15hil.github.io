## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is browning, add your medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Drain your pineapple (save the juice!) and chop into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once the chicken has begun to brown, add the pepper strips and chopped pineapple to the pan with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the pepper has slightly softened


### Step 6

Combine the reserved pineapple juice with your ginger & garlic paste, sriracha and soy sauce

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and stir it all together – this is your sweet & spicy sauce

Once done, drain the soaked noodles, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water


### Step 7

Add the soaked noodles to the pan with the sweet & spicy sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy pineapple & chicken breast noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add some starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a bit dry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy pineapple & chicken breast noodle stir-fry in a bowl

Sprinkle your black sesame seeds all over

Enjoy!
