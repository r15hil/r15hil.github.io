## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 120g spinach
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 7g dried yeast
- 100g Greek salad cheese
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 250g pizza base mix
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tsp baharat
- 1 shallot
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking paper-lined baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the gözleme bottoms from going soggy!)

Combine the pizza base mix, yeast and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl, then add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk, 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>warm water and a small drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up with clean hands until a dough forms


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Wash, then add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stems

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


### Step 4

Add the chopped spinach to a large bowl and crumble in the Greek cheese

Add the chopped garlic, chopped shallot, baharat, ground cumin, most of the chopped spring onion, half the chopped mint & coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your cheesy spinach filling


### Step 5

Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, then roll each piece out to a large rectangle approx. 0.2cm thickness with a rolling pin

Divide the cheesy spinach filling between the dough rectangles, covering only half of each rectangle, reserve the bowl

Fold the other half of the dough over the filling and press down to seal, pushing as much air out as possible before pinching the edges of the dough closed – these are your cheesy spinach gözleme


### Step 6

Remove the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven, drizzle the baking paper with a little olive oil and add the cheesy spinach gözleme

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to the cheesy spinach gözleme, then put them in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until golden

While the gözleme are cooking, cut the cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 7

Add the chopped tomatoes to the reserved bowl with the chopped cucumber, remaining coriander & mint, remaining chopped spring onion, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad

Combine the natural yoghurt with a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl – this is your lemony yoghurt

### Step 8

Slice the cheesy spinach gözleme into quarters

Serve the cheesy spinach gözleme with the tomato salad, lemony yoghurt and lemon wedges to the side

Enjoy!
