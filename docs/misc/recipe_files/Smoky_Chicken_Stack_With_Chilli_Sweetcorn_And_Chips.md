## Ingredients

- 150g canned sweetcorn
- 30ml mayonnaise
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 15ml cider vinegar 	
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 125g mozzarella ball
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 skewers
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the chicken breast portions to a chopping board, cover with cling film, then bash with a rolling pin until about 1 cm thick

Add half the ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the flattened chicken to the plate and coat in the spices


### Step 2

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and crisp

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)


### Step 3

Cut the paprika chicken breasts in half so that you are left with 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>pieces

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into quarters

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>pieces


### Step 4

Layer the paprika chicken followed by a pepper quarter (hollow of the pepper facing up) then the torn mozzarella

Repeat this again and insert a skewer down the centre so that everything stays in place – these are your smoky chicken stacks


### Step 5

Add the smoky chicken stacks to a baking tray lined with tin foil (to avoid mess!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drain the sweetcorn


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and spring onion and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Add the drained sweetcorn, dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the cider vinegar and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the vinegar has been absorbed


### Step 7

Combine the mayo, remaining smoked paprika and remaining cider vinegar in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky mayo

### Step 8

Serve the smoky chicken stack with the chips, chilli sweetcorn and smoky mayo to the side

Enjoy!
