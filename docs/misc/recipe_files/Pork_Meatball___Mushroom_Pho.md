## Ingredients

- 0 pork mince
- 150g rice noodles
- 1 red chilli
- 25g Pho broth paste
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 15ml soy sauce
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 250g British pork mince
- 1 chestnut mushrooms
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1 spring onion
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and grate half your brown onion[s]

Slice the remaining onion finely

Slice your chestnut mushrooms

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely dice the remaining red chilli


### Step 2

Combine the grated onion, diced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and pepper

Divide the meatball mixture and shape them into 4 meatballs per person


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later (reserve the pan!)


### Step 4

Add your rice noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender, then drain

Once drained, return the noodles to the pot and set aside


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat, with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add your pho broth paste, toasted sesame oil, ginger & garlic paste and soy sauce with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 6

Transfer the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, add the drained noodles to the pan and cook for 1 min or until warmed through – this is your pork meatball & mushroom pho


### Step 7

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the pork meatball & mushroom pho

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and chopped mint & coriander

Enjoy!
