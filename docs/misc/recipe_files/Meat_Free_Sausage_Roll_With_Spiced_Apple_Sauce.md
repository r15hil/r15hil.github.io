### Step 5

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Place the pastry on the tray[s], then add the meat-free sausage roll mix and lay it down the centre of the pastry in a sausage shape

Tip: You may need to make multiple if cooking for more than 2!

### Step 6

Roll the pastry tightly over the mix and continue to roll until the meat-free sausage roll mix is encased by pastry, then place it seal-side down and carefully score the top with a sharp knife

Season along the top with a pinch of salt and sprinkle over your black sesame seeds

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until golden and crispy – this is your meat-free sausage roll

Cook for 8-10 min further or until the apple has started to break down

Once done, set aside to cool slightly before serving – this is your spiced apple sauce

Remove the star anise and discard

### Step 8

Slice the meat-free sausage roll in half and serve with the roasted root veg and spiced apple sauce on the side

Enjoy!
