## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Add your sushi rice to an oven-proof dish with a small pinch of salt and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sticky rice


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, drain your king prawns, then add them to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Add half your shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good stir until the prawns are completely coated – these are your togarashi prawns

Set aside to marinate


### Step 4

Combine your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your mayo and a splash of cold water in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo


### Step 5

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways

Drizzle your rice vinegar over the sliced avocado

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the sushi rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven, pour your mirin over the rice, then top the rice with the togarashi prawns

Return the dish to the oven for a further 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your king prawn 'sushi' rice bake

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn 'sushi' rice bake topped with the sliced avocado and sliced spring onion

Drizzle over your tamari soy sauce and sriracha mayo

Sprinkle over the remaining shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your seaweed flakes

Dig in!
