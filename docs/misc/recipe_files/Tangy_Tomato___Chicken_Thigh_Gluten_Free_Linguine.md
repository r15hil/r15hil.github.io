## Ingredients

- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g) x2
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- British diced chicken thigh (250g)
- Gluten free linguine (190g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Add your chopped tomatoes and chicken stock mix, then increase the heat to medium and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 10-15 min or until the tomatoes have reduced to the consistency of a thick sauce and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)– this is your tomato & chicken thigh sauce


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your gluten free linguine to a large pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt over a high heat

Bring to the boil and cook for 8-10 min, or until cooked with a slight bite


### Step 6

While the linguine is cooking, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

When the linguine is almost done, add the spinach to the pot and cook for 30 secs or until the spinach has wilted, then drain the linguine & spinach and reserve a cup of starchy pasta water


### Step 7

Once the tomato sauce has thickened, add the drained linguine & spinach to the pan with the red wine vinegar, 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar, a very generous pinch of salt and a splash of starchy pasta water

Mix everything up until the linguine is coated in the sauce – this is your tangy tomato & chicken thigh gluten free linguine

### Step 8

Serve the tangy tomato & chicken thigh gluten free linguine and sprinkle over the black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
