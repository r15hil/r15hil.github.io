- 2 tsp coriander seeds
- 15g root ginger
- 1 lime 
- 1 tin of pineapple

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Add the rice, coriander seeds and a large pinch of salt to a medium pot over a high heat with 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> cold water


Bring to the boil and cook for 25-30 min or until tender with a slight bite


Drain and return to the pot, covered, until&nbsp;later


### Step 2

Meanwhile, zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> then cut 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> thin slices from the centre<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and reserve the remaining ends for garnish&nbsp;


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Chop the bottom half of the coriander (mainly stalks)&nbsp;finely, saving the leaves for a later step


### Step 3

Grind the lime zest, ginger, half the coriander,&nbsp;a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil&nbsp;in a pestle and mortar to form a paste


Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything&nbsp;very finely and mix with vegetable oil


### Step 4

Place the fish onto a lightly oiled baking tray (use tin foil to avoid a mess)


Spread the&nbsp;lime/ginger paste&nbsp;over the fish


Top each fillet with 2&nbsp;lime slices


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Cook the fish on the top rack for 8-10 min or until the lime slices are beginning to brown


Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop&nbsp;the pineapple finely


Chop the remaining coriander (mainly leaves) roughly


### Step 7

Once the rice has been cooked and drained, add the pineapple and the remaining coriander


Stir to combine


Taste for seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve&nbsp;the ginger/lime baked fish with your pineapple rice


Squeeze the remaining lime over the fish


Enjoy!
