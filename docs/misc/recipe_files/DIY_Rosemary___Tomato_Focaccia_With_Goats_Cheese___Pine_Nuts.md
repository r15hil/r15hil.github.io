### Step 5

Coat a baking tray (or two!) with a little olive oil

Once the dough has rested for 10 min, divide into 1 per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>and add to the oiled baking tray[s]

Tip: It will be very soft and sticky – slightly oiled hands is the best way!

Spread the rested dough out into rough circle[s] approx. 2cm thick and press your fingertips into the dough to make dimples
