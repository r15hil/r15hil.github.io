## Description

Pasanda means "favourite" in Urdu, possibly because it's such a crowd-pleaser. To make this creamy curry, you'll add chicken to a rich, mildly spiced sauce, then serve with rice and garlic and coriander naan.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden then set aside for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic with your garam masala and ground turmeric and cook for 4-5 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a little more oil if the pan looks a little dry


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast strips into large, bite-sized pieces and boil a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water - this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Once the spices are fragrant, increase the heat to high and add the chopped chicken and cook for 2 min or until coated in the spices

Add your chicken stock mix with the ground almonds, chopped tomatoes, coconut stock and a pinch of sugar and cook for 8-12 min further, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naan once out of the toaster

Once the chicken is cooked through, add your natural yoghurt and stir it all together – this is your creamy chicken pasanda

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken pasanda with the basmati rice and a warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!
