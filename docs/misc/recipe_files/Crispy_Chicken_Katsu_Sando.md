## Description

A katsu sando is a classic Japanese sandwich made with crispy pork. For our version, you'll swap pork for crispy breaded chicken and pile it into crusty ciabatta with creamy shredded lettuce and tonkatsu sauce (like a Japanese BBQ sauce). Oishii (yum)!

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, chop the little gem lettuce in half lengthways

Shred half the little gem finely

Cut the remaining gem into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> wedges

### Step 3

Combine the mayonnaise with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> rice vinegar (save the rest for later!) and the shredded gem in a bowl

Stir it all together – this is your creamy slaw

### Step 4

Combine the remaining rice vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your dressing

Cover the chicken breasts with cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until flattened

Season both sides of the flattened chicken with salt

### Step 5

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat the seasoned chicken in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it into the beaten egg and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and crispy – this is your katsu chicken

### Step 7

Once everything is almost cooked, add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed and crusty

Once done, carefully cut the warmed ciabatta rolls in half

### Step 8

Fill the ciabatta rolls with the creamy slaw, a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce, the katsu chicken, then some more tonkatsu sauce – these are your crispy chicken katsu sandos

Serve with the chips and lettuce wedges to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with the dressing and garnish with the schichimi togarashi

Enjoy!
