## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your free range chicken thighs to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), then once cooked, remove the tray from the oven and set aside


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, Henderson's Relish, dried oregano, dried basil and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add your chopped tomatoes and stock with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 min or until thickened slightly – this is your sauce


### Step 5

Meanwhile, melt 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g] </span>butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [525ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [700ml] </span>milk gradually and whisk for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season generously with pepper – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 6

Add your spinach to a colander and pour the remaining boiled water all over it until bright green and wilted

Run the wilted spinach under the cold tap and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once cooked, transfer the free range chicken thighs to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the pulled free range chicken to the sauce – this is your free range chicken mixture


### Step 7

Add half the free range chicken mixture to an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets

Repeat this process again, then add a layer of the wilted spinach followed by the remaining lasagne sheets

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish!

Cover with the béchamel and grated cheese and cook in the oven for 20-25 min or until the pasta is cooked – this is your free range chicken & spinach lasagne

### Step 8

Once done, remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Serve the free range chicken & spinach lasagne with a handful of salad to the side

Enjoy!
