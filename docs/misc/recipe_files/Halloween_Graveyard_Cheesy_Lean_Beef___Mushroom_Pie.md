## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes, then slice 1/5 of the potato[es] (you'll use the rest later!) into thin discs and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the potato discs in the oven for 10-12 min or until beginning to brown – these are your potato tombstones


### Step 2

Chop the remaining peeled potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

While the onion is softening, reboil half a kettle

Chop your mushrooms roughly

Once the onion has softened, add your lean beef mince to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Increase the heat to high and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

While the mince is browning, dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste and Henderson's Relish

When your mince has browned, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

Add the beef stock, give everything a good mix up, bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened, then transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish, reserve the pan


### Step 6

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of milk, then mash until smooth

Grate your cheddar cheese over the top of the lean beef & mushroom filling and top with the mashed potato, then push the potato tombstones in so they're standing upright

Put the pie in the oven for 15-20 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pie is bubbling and golden – this is your Halloween graveyard cheesy lean beef & mushroom pie


### Step 7

Top, tail and peel your carrot[s] then chop into batons

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter with 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add the carrot batons with a pinch of salt and cook, covered for 10-12 min or until softened with a slight bite

Chop your parsley roughly

### Step 8

Serve the Halloween graveyard cheesy lean beef & mushroom pie with the chopped parsley sprinkled on top

Serve the carrot to the side

Enjoy!
