## Ingredients

- 150g sushi rice
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1  tsp cornflour
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 6 Proper Porker sausages
- 160g blanched peas
- 30ml tomato ketchup
- 8ml soy sauce
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, add the sausages to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through – these are your bangers

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Peel, then cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Separate the onion wedges into petals

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Combine the ketchup and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water in a small bowl with the cornflour, rice vinegar and soy sauce – this is your sweet & sour mixture


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion petals with 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until caramelised


### Step 6

Once caramelised, add the chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the sweet & sour mixture and cook for 1-2 min or until reduced to a gravy-like consistency, then remove the pan from the heat – this is your sweet & sour 'gravy'


### Step 7

Reboil a kettle

Add the blanched peas to a sieve and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 8

Return the sweet & sour 'gravy' to a low heat to reheat gently

Serve your bangers on top of the sushi rice with the refreshed peas to the side

Drizzle the sweet & sour 'gravy' over everything and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
