### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind (or chop if you don't have a pestle and mortar) to a fine powder


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes, chopped garlic, ground fennel seeds and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Stir through your tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Add your linguine to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes are fragrant, add the tomato stock and crab meat to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to a pasta sauce-like consistency – this is your fiery tomato sauce


### Step 6

Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate any remaining Italian hard cheese

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the drained linguine to the fiery tomato sauce and gently stir together

Cook for 1 min further until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your fiery tomato, crab & fennel linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the fiery tomato, crab & fennel linguine topped with chopped basil and Italian hard cheese shavings

Season with a grind of black pepper and drizzle with some olive oil

Enjoy!
