## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Gem lettuce
- Baked beans (200g)
- BBQ sauce (40g)
- Ciabatta x2
- White potato x3
- British beef mince (250g)
- Chives (5g)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, season your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patties to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince into 1 per person, then shape into patties


### Step 3

Cut your lettuce into quarters lengthways, then wash and pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your chives finely

Slice your cheddar cheese into 3 slices per person


### Step 4

Combine your mayo, chopped chives and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your chive mayo


### Step 5

Once the potatoes have been cooking for 15 min, heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties and cook for 4 min on each side or until nicely browned


### Step 6

Once browned, top the patties with the cheddar slices and cook, covered, for a further 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the patties are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, slice your ciabattas in half and put them in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted


### Step 7

Combine your baked beans and BBQ sauce in a small heat-proof bowl

Cook the beans in the microwave for 1 min, then stir them and return them to the microwave for 1 min further, or until piping hot – these are your BBQ beans

Spoon the BBQ beans on the base of each toasted ciabatta base, then top with a cheeseburger patty and a toasted ciabatta lid – these are your BBQ beans on toast beef burgers

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ beans on toast beef burger with the crispy potatoes, lettuce quarters and chive mayo to the side

Dress the lettuce quarters with the remaining white wine vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!
