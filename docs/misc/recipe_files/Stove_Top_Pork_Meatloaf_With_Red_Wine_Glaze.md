### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain over a large bowl (save the water for later!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges, reserve the pot

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and slice 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> brown onion<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely and grate the remaining onion

Peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Combine the red wine paste, tomato paste and honey in a small bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your red wine glaze

### Step 3

Combine the pork mince and grated onion in a medium bowl with the dried thyme, panko breadcrumbs, half the grated garlic and half the beef stock mix

Season with a grind of pepper and using clean hands give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your pork mixture

Shape the pork mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>mini<span class="text-danger"> </span>loaves

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatloaves to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, turning occasionally until browned on all sides

Once browned, turn the heat down to low, add 80ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water to the pan and drizzle the red wine glaze over the meatloaves (reserve the bowl) and cook, covered for 20-22 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash then chop the cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 16-17 min or until golden and crispy, turning occasionally for even colouring

### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>knobs of butter

Once melted, add the sliced onion and remaining garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add the Chantenay carrots (no need to top or peel!) with 120ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>reserved potato water and cook, covered for an initial 8-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1676975673272-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the carrots have had an initial 8-9 min, add the chopped cavolo nero and cook, covered for a final 2-3 min or until wilted – these are your Chantenay carrots & greens

Add the cornflour and soy sauce to the reserved small bowl with the remaining beef stock mix and gradually stir in 130ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water (this is to ensure there's no lumps!) – this is your gravy mix

Put the gravy mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring half way – this is your gravy

### Step 8

Serve the pork meatloaves with the crispy potatoes and Chantenay carrots & greens to the side

Add any remaining red wine glaze from the pan to the gravy and give everything a good mix up – this is your red wine gravy

Drizzle the red wine gravy all over everything

Enjoy!
