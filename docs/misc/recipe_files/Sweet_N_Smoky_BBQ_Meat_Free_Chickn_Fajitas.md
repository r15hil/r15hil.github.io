## Ingredients

- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Red onion
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Spring onion
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the vegetables begin to soften


### Step 3

Once the vegetables begin to soften, add your meat-free chick'n to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min, or until warmed through


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes roughly, then keep chopping them together until they resemble a salsa-like consistency

Add the chopped tomatoes to a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Stir it all together – this is your salsa

Peel and grate your garlic


### Step 5

Combine your ground smoked paprika, ground coriander and ground cumin in a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your BBQ spice mix

Once the meat-free chick'n has warmed through, add the BBQ spice mix and the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to the pan and cook out for 2-3 min or until fragrant – this is your sweet 'n' smoky BBQ meat-free chick'n fajita filling


### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Grate your cheddar cheese

Trim then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 8

Serve the sweet 'n' smoky BBQ meat-free chick'n fajita filling over the warmed tortillas

Top with the grated cheddar and salsa

Dollop over your natural yoghurt, garnish with the sliced spring onion and enjoy!
