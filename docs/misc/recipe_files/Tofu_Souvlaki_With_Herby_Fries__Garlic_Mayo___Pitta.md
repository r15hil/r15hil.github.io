### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper then cut into small bite-sized pieces

Add the tofu pieces to a large bowl with your soy sauce and set aside to marinate

### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, half the dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up and set aside – these are your pickled shallots

### Step 4

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add your mayo to a bowl with half the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a splash of water – this is your garlic mayo

### Step 5

Once the tofu is marinated, add the remaining dried oregano and your  ground cumin to the bowl with the ground smoked paprika and the remaining grated garlic

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced tofu

### Step 6

Thread the spiced tofu onto the soaked skewers

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the tofu skewers and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden – these are you tofu souvlaki skewers

### Step 7

Meanwhile, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato to a bowl with the pickled shallot liquid and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressed salad

Add your wholemeal pittas to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Top the tofu souvlaki skewers with the pickled shallots

Serve the herby fries, dressed salad, warmed pitta and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
