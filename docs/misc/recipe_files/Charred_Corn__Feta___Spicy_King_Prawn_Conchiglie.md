### Step 1

Preheat the grill to medium and boil a full kettle

Add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, reserve 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water and drain the cooked conchiglie

### Step 2

Drain your sweetcorn

Add the drained sweetcorn to a tin foil-lined baking tray with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a pinch of pepper and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up

### Step 3

Put the tray under the grill and cook for 8-10 min or until the corn is lightly charred – this is your charred corn

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Drain, then add your king prawns and mix everything together – these are your marinated king prawns

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add your tomato paste with your ground smoked paprika and ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the marinated king prawns and cook for an initial 3 min

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Once the prawns have had 3 min, add the reserved starchy pasta water and vegetable stock mix to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened – these are your spicy king prawns

### Step 7

Add the cooked conchiglie and half the charred corn to the spicy prawns and stir it all together until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce – this is your spicy king prawn conchiglie

Season with a grind of black pepper

Crumble your feta over the remaining charred corn, add the sliced spring onion and mix together – this is your charred corn & feta

### Step 8

Serve the charred corn & feta over the spicy king prawn conchiglie

Enjoy!
