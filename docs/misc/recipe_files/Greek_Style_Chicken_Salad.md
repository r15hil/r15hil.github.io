### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a high heat

Boil half a kettle

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Roughly chop your black olives

### Step 6

Add your dried oregano, roasted garlic paste and juice of half the lemon[s] to the chicken and cook for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek-style chicken

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 7

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped cucumber, tomatoes and olives to a bowl

Add the juice of the remaining lemon, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your chopped salad

Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork then add the chopped parsley – this is your herby couscous

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style chicken with the chopped salad and herby couscous to the side

Crumble over your feta

Enjoy!
