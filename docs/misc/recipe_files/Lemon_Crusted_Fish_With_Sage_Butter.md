### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon (try to grate lightly and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Combine the panko breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt on a plate and give everything a good mix up – these are your lemony breadcrumbs

### Step 2

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and add them to an oiled baking tray

Top with the lemony breadcrumbs and press them into the fish using the back of a spoon

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Tip: If you'd rather skin-off mash, peel the potatoes first

Add the potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, trim the ends off the spring onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the whole spring onions and cook for 2-3 min or until they're soft and lightly browned

Once browned, transfer the spring onions to the same tray as the fish and reserve the pan

### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the clotted cream

Pick the sage leaves from their stems, add them to the pan and cook for 1 min or until crispy

Once the clotted cream has melted, cut and juice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> straight into the pan

Add the capers and remove the pan from the heat - this is your sage butter sauce

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/803.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the chopped garlic, a knob of butter and a splash of milk to the drained potatoes

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Serve the lemon crusted basa over the mash and garnish with the spring onions

Spoon over the sage butter sauce

Enjoy!
