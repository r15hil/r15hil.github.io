### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice the Chantenay carrots in half lengthways


Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper


Add the halved carrots and cloves to the centre of the baking paper

### Step 3

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the carrots to form a sealed parcel – these are your en papillote carrots


Tip: En papillote is French for "enveloped in paper"

Add the en papillote carrots to the other side of the tray


Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until the gammon is cooked through


Boil a kettle

### Step 5

Peel the potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces


Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender


Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 6

Once the cranberries have broken down, add a knob of butter to the pot with a pinch of pepper and gently stir it all together until the sauce has reached a gravy-like consistency - this is your cranberry gravy


Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk and a large knob of butter


Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


Stir the wholegrain mustard through the mash – this is your mustard mash

### Step 8

Slice the roast ham finely


Serve the sliced ham over the mustard mash with the en papillote carrots and cranberry gravy to the side


Tip: Remove the cloves from your carrots before serving


Enjoy!
