## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Fig relish (25g)
- Cheese flavour slices (2pcs)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ciabatta x2
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Rocket (50g)
- Rosemary & thyme (10g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Strip your rosemary and thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly together, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down the lengths to easily remove the leaves


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and the chopped herbs

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby fries


### Step 3

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Add your meat-free patty[ies] to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your fig relish to the pan and stir until the onions are coated in the sticky relish

Reduce the heat to very low and cook until ready to serve or until they have softened and caramelised – these are your figgy onions


### Step 6

Once the patty[ies] is cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice – this is your cheezy meat-free patty

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheeze has melted and the ciabatta is warmed through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and toss it in the balsamic dressing – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Spread your mayo over the warmed ciabatta base and lid, then fill with a cheezy meat-free patty, some figgy onions and a handful of the dressed salad – this is your plant-based burger with figgy onions

Serve the plant-based burger with figgy onions with the herby fries and remaining dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
