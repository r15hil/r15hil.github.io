## Ingredients

- 400g potatoes
- 10g fresh parsely 
- 100g British mini cooking chorizo
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar 
- 4 British free range eggs 
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 230&deg;C/ 210&deg;C (fan)/ 450&deg;F/ Gas 8


Cut all the potatoes (skins on) into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


Add&nbsp;them to a baking tray, drizzle with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil and season generously&nbsp;with salt&nbsp;


Put them in the oven for an initial 25 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel&nbsp;and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Deseed the yellow&nbsp;pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


<span style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span>


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil over a medium-low heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper with a big pinch of salt


Cook for 15-20 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the&nbsp;mini chorizo in half


Peel and finely slice the garlic


Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Once&nbsp;the potatoes are very nearly cooked, remove the tray from the oven, turn the potatoes and scatter the chorizo amongst them


Return the tray to the oven for a further 10 min or until the potatoes are crisp and the chorizo is hot


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate pan (large enough to fit 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>&nbsp;eggs in, and preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with 1 tbsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil over a medium-low heat


Tip:&nbsp;shake your eggs before cracking for a perfectly-centred yolk


Once&nbsp;hot, add the eggs, cover and cook for 3 min


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the sliced garlic to the onion and pepper pan and reduce the heat to low (adding more olive oil if too dry)


Stir in&nbsp;the&nbsp;apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar


Cook for a further 2 min, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Stir most of the chopped parsley through the pepper and onion mixture - this is your relish


Serve the eggs over the chorizo and potatoes


Serve the&nbsp;relish to the side and garnish with the remaining parsley


Enjoy!
