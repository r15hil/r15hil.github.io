## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Slice your red chilli[es] finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the chopped pepper and onion wedges to the dish with half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 4

Add your curry powder and dried thyme with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped creamed coconut and ginger & garlic paste with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml] </span>boiled water, your vegetable stock mix and bay leaf[ves]

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven for 20 min, uncovered, or until the pepper is tender – this is your curry


### Step 6

Reboil the kettle

Add your white long grain rice and a generous pinch of salt to an oven-proof dish with 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Chop your cod fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Once the pepper is tender, remove the dish from the oven and top with the chopped cod and a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the dish to the oven, covered, and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – this is your baked Caribbean-style cod curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily!

### Step 8

Serve the baked Caribbean-style cod curry with the baked rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced chillies (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Dig in!
