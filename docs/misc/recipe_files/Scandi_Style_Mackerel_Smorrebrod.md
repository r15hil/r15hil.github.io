### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add the potato discs to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Chop your chives finely

Slice your cucumber[s] finely

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Remove the outer leaves from the lettuce and shred the inner core

### Step 5

Slice your bread roll[s] in half

Once the potatoes have cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push the potatoes to one side

Add the sliced bread to the other side of the baking tray[s], then return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the bread is starting to brown

### Step 6

Heat a small pot with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the chopped chives and the chopped mackerel and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your buttery chive mackerel

### Step 7

While the mackerel is warming, add the juice of the remaining lemon to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressing

Add the shredded lettuce, half the sliced cucumber (save the rest for later!) and chopped tomato to the bowl and toss until fully coated – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

To build, spread the roasted garlic mayo on each toasted bread roll half

Top with the cooked potato discs, a lettuce leaf, the remaining sliced cucumber, buttery chive mackerel and your crispy onions

Serve the dressed salad to one side

Enjoy!
