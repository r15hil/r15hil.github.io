## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and roughly chop your potato[es]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour, then unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 piece per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper lined-tray (or two!) and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then crimp the borders with a fork

Sprinkle your nigella seeds over the pastry and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your pie lid[s]


### Step 4

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped potatoes, curry powder and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add your mustard seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and starting to pop

Add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite – these are your mustardy greens


### Step 7

Cut your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Place the chopped basa over the curry and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

To serve, lay the pie lid over the basa curry pie filling – this is your basa curry pie

Serve the basa curry pie with the mustardy greens to the side

Enjoy!
