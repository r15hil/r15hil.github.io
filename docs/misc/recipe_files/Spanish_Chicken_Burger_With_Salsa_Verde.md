## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 20g rocket
- 2 ciabatta roll
-  5.5g Dijon mustard
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 x 125g British chicken breast fillets
- 15ml white wine vinegar 
- 5g parsley
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 15g capers
- 1 pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Whilst the chips are cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop the capers finely


### Step 3

Combine the chopped parsley and capers with the white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and mix thoroughly – this is your salsa verde


### Step 4

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the sliced pepper to a separate baking tray and set aside


### Step 5

Add the smoked paprika and ground coriander to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Bash the chicken breasts with a rolling pin to flatten them slightly

Turn the chicken breasts in the spices several times until they're fully coated


### Step 6

Add the spiced chicken breasts to the tray with the yellow pepper and drizzle everything with olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the peppers have softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once everything's almost cooked, add the ciabatta rolls to the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Once done, carefully slice them in half

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Fill each ciabatta roll with some mayo, salsa verde and a spiced chicken breast

Toss the roasted pepper through the rocket and serve to the side with the chips

Drizzle any remaining salsa verde over the salad

Enjoy!
