## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 0 85g raw king prawns
- 0 curry powder
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 300g chopped pepper & pineapple
- 300g edamame & jasmine rice
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 15g tamarind paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 5g coriander

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper & pineapple (including any excess pineapple juice!) with the ginger & garlic paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 2 min until the pepper has started to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the edamame & jasmine rice to a large, heatproof bowl and put the bowl in the microwave for 2-3 min or until piping hot

Dissolve the coconut cream in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 3

Once the pepper has softened slightly, add the king prawns and curry powder and cook for 2 min until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the tamarind paste, coconut stock and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min further or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your prawn & pineapple panang curry

### Step 5

Serve the prawn & pineapple panang curry over the edamame & jasmine rice

Tear over the coriander leaves

Enjoy!
