### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your orzo to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orzo for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orzo, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Wash your salad and your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the tomatoes have softened slightly, add your roasted garlic paste to the pan and stir it all together

### Step 6

Add the spinach to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until starting to wilt

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1705334905961-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the spinach is starting to wilt, add your pesto with your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste

Crumble half your goats' cheese (you'll use the rest later!) directly into the pan

Add the cooked orzo with a small splash of starchy pasta water and mix until thoroughly combined – this is your goat’s cheese, tomato & pesto orzo

### Step 8

Serve the goats’ cheese, tomato & pesto orzo topped with your pine nuts and a pinch of pepper, then crumble your remaining goats’ cheese on top

Serve the salad to the side topped with a small drizzle of olive oil and your balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!
