### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

### Step 2

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up roughly with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

While the pork is browning, cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized cubes

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your beef stock mix, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[625ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water

Stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 15 min or until the pork mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chipotle pork stew

### Step 6

Add your sweetcorn (no need to drain) to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until charred – this is your baked corn

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small bite-sized pieces

### Step 7

Once the stew has had an initial 15 min, add the chopped pepper and cook, covered, for a final 6-7 min or until the pepper is tender with a bite and the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency

Remove the baked corn from the oven and stir half through the chipotle pork stew – this is your chipotle pork & corn stew

### Step 8

Serve the chipotle pork & corn stew in bowls and top with a dollop of your soured cream

Sprinkle over the remaining baked corn

Enjoy!
