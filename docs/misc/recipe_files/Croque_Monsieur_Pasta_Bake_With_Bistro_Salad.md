### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite then drain

### Step 2

While the pasta is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop half your prosciutto finely (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 3

Combine the grated cheese with your cornflour in a pot and mix until fully combined

Add the chopped garlic and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk to the pot and stir it all together

Cook over a medium heat for 4-6 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly


### Step 4

Once thickened, remove from the heat

Add half your Dijon mustard to the sauce with half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and the chopped prosciutto

Season with a generous pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your croque monsieur sauce


### Step 5

Add the drained tortiglioni to the sauce

Stir it all together and add to an oven-proof dish


### Step 6

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and reserved prosciutto slices

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your croque monsieur pasta bake


### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining Dijon mustard with your honey, cider vinegar, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Add the salad and sliced cucumber to the dressing and toss – this is your bistro salad
