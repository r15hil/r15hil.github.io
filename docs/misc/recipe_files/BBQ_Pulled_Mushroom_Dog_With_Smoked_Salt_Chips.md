### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your lettuce, and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the lettuce into quarters lengthways – these are your lettuce wedges

Dissolve your tomato ketchup and soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> boiled water with most of your cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) – this is your BBQ sauce

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until browned

### Step 4

Once browned, transfer the Fable pulled mushrooms to a clean chopping board and reserve the pan

Shred them apart, using two forks – these are your pulled mushrooms

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the BBQ sauce and half your smoked sea salt (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce is slightly reduced

### Step 6

Once slightly reduced, add the pulled mushrooms to the sauce and mix it all together

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the mushrooms are warmed through and well coated in the sauce – these are your BBQ pulled mushrooms

### Step 7

Once the chips are almost cooked, cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s]

Add the cut hot dog bun[s] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Add the lettuce wedges to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, the remaining cider vinegar and a small pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – these are your dressed wedges

### Step 8

Fill the warmed hot dog bun with the BBQ pulled mushrooms, then top with most of your crispy onions

Serve the chips to the side and sprinkle the remaining smoked sea salt on top – these are your smoked salt chips

Serve the dressed lettuce wedges to the side and sprinkle over the remaining crispy onions

Enjoy!
