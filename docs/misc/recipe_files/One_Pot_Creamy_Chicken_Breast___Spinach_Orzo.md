Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and diced onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften and the chicken is starting to brown

### Step 5

Add your orzo to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add your stock and soft cheese and cook, covered, stirring frequently, for 10-12 min, or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Stirring the orzo will release the starch from the pasta, making it creamier!

### Step 6

While the orzo is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the orzo is cooked, add the spinach and cook for a further 1-2 min, stirring until wilted

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy chicken & spinach orzo

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken & spinach orzo and garnish with the chopped basil and grated cheese

Enjoy!
