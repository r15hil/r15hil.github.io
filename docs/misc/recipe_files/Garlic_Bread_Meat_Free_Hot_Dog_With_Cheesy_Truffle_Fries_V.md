### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 2

Add the fries and chopped rosemary to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your rosemary fries

### Step 3

Add your meat-free hot dog sausage[s] to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook for 10-12 min or until softened and caramelised – this is your balsamic caramelised onion

### Step 5

While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add a generous knob of butter to a bowl with the chopped garlic, chopped parsley and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic & parsley butter

Tip: If your butter is not soft then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!

### Step 6

Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s] and then cut a few slits across diagonally (being careful not to cut all the way through!)

Spoon the garlic & parsley butter into each slit – these are your garlic bread bun[s]

Once the sausage[s] has had an initial 20 min remove the tray from the oven and add the bun[s] to other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1724229772815-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato to a large bowl with the remaining balsamic vinegar and toss until coated – this is your tomato salad

### Step 8

Drizzle the rosemary fries with your truffle oil (not a fan of truffle? Just add a little!) and top with the grated Italian hard cheese – these are your cheesy rosemary & truffle fries

Fill each garlic bread bun with a meat-free hot dog sausage and top with the balsamic caramelised onion, then serve the tomato salad and cheesy rosemary & truffle fries to the side

Enjoy!
