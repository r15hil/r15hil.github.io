### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and allow to steam

### Step 2

While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, chopped garlic, and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then finely slice

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, garam masala and a splash of water and cook for 1 min

Add the sliced Brussels sprouts to the pan with a knob of butter and cook for 7-8 min further or until softened

### Step 5

While the sprouts are softening, grate your cheddar cheese and chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Once softened, add your mango chutney, grated cheese and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!)

Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Brussels sprout & garam masala tart filling

### Step 6

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person

Transfer the pastry square[s] to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Top the centre of pastry square[s] with the Brussels sprout & garam masala tart filling

### Step 7

Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray and crush gently

Add a drizzle of olive oil, your nigella seeds and a generous pinch of salt – these are your nigella smashed potatoes

Put the Brussels sprout & garam masala tarts and nigella smashed potatoes in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the potatoes are caramelised

Wash your lamb's lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the Brussels sprout & garam masala tart with the nigella smashed potatoes and lamb's lettuce to the side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of pepper to the lamb's lettuce

Top the tart with the remaining chopped coriander and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
