### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock, halved green beans and sultanas to the pan with the chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry

Serve the curried chicken noodles and garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!
