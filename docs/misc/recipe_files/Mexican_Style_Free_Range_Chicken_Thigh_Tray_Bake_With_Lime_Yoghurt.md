## Ingredients

- Ground cumin (1tsp) x2
- Red onion x2
- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Spring onion
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Lime
- Red pepper
- Sweet potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine your chipotle paste (cant't handle the heat? Go easy), ground smoked paprika and soy sauce in a bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil – this is your marinade


### Step 2

Add your free range chicken thighs to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside for later


### Step 3

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your sweet potato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips


### Step 4

Add the chopped red onion, pepper strips and sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!)

Sprinkle over your ground cumin

Drizzle with vegetable oil and add a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add the marinated chicken thighs to the tray[s]


### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!) and tender – this is your Mexican-style chicken thigh tray bake


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half your lime with your natural yoghurt in a bowl – this is your lime yoghurt

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style free range chicken thigh tray bake drizzled with the lime yoghurt

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
