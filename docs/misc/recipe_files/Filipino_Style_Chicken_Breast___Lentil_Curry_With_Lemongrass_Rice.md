### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and boil a kettle

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 2

While the onion is softening, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and garlic

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Chop the softer inner core finely

Remove the tough outer layers of the lemongrass and set aside for later

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the remaining

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the bay leaf[ves], chopped ginger, garlic, lemongrass, and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your diced chicken breast, half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

While the chicken is browning, drain and rinse your green lentils

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut (if required!), then dissolve your chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add your tomato paste, rinsed lentils and coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

Add your white long grain rice, outer lemongrass layers and 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1699442199394-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

While the rice is cooking, add the chilli rounds to a bowl with the remaining cider vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1699442203397-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After an initial 20 min, add the spinach to the pan and cook, uncovered, for a further 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your Filipino-style chicken breast & lentil curry

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

### Step 8

Serve the Filipino-style chicken breast & lentil curry over the lemongrass rice (discard the lemongrass!)

Garnish with the quick-pickled chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
