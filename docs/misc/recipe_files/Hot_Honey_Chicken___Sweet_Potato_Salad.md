## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips


### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potato and pepper strips to a baking tray with the ground smoked paprika and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and the pepper has charred slightly – this is your roasted sweet potato & pepper


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 10-15 min or until the skins have browned and crisped


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, add your honey to a bowl with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your hot honey


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly chop

Combine your white wine vinegar and your mayo with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy dressing


### Step 7

Once the chicken has browned, turn the chicken thighs skin side up and add the hot honey

Cook them for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your hot honey chicken

### Step 8

Serve the hot honey chicken over the chopped lettuce with the roasted sweet potato & pepper and any remaining sauce from the pan

Drizzle the creamy dressing all over

Enjoy!
