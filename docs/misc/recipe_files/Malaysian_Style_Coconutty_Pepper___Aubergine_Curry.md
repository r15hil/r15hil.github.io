## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and chop your shallots into wedges, then peel and chop your garlic roughly

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pod (reserve the seeds!)


### Step 2

Add the cardamom seeds to a pestle & mortar with your ground cumin, coriander seeds and a pinch of salt and grind to a coarse powder – this is your curry spice mix

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, crush the coriander seeds by squashing them with the side of a knife

Add the chopped ginger and garlic to a food processor with half the shallot wedges (you'll use the rest later), your curry spice mix and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and blitz until smooth – this is your Malaysian-style curry paste


### Step 3

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and tamarind paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the Malaysian-style curry paste, ground turmeric and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped pepper, chopped aubergine, remaining shallot wedges and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the veg is fully coated and starting to soften


### Step 7

Once starting to soften, add your coconut stock and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the veg is tender – this is your Malaysian-style coconutty pepper & aubergine curry

### Step 8

Serve the Malaysian-style coconutty pepper & aubergine curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
