## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and grate your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the grated onion, chopped garlic and chopped ginger with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid, and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, dissolve your tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and honey in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder and ground paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce is beginning to thicken


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Once the sauce has started to thicken, add the chopped basa to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once done, add your clotted cream and cook for 1 min further or until melted – this is your basa tikka masala

### Step 8

Serve the basa tikka masala with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!
