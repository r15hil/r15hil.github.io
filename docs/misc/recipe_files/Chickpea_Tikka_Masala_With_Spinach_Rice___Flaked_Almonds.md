### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Boil a full kettle

Heat a dry large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a bowl and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

While the the almonds are toasting, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your ground paprika to the pan with your curry powder, garam masala and the drained chickpeas

### Step 6

Add the tomato stock to the pan with your chopped tomatoes and mango chutney

Bring to the boil and cook for 6-7 min further or until thickened

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold water until it's cool, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly

### Step 7

Stir the chopped spinach through the cooked rice – this is your spinach rice

Once the curry has thickened, add half your cultured coconut (you'll use the rest later!) and stir it all together – this is your chickpea tikka masala
