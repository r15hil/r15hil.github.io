## Instructions


### Step 1

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large dry pan over a medium heat


### Step 2

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to blister

Tip: Squash the tomatoes with the back of a spoon to release their juices!


### Step 6

Once the tomatoes have blistered, add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and sliced garlic

Season with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your soft cheese and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan with the drained tagliatelle, vegetable stock mix and a generous splash of reserved starchy pasta water

Season with a pinch of salt and a good grind of pepper – this is your creamy tomato sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the creamy tomato sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and toasted pine nuts

Serve the salad to the side

Enjoy!
