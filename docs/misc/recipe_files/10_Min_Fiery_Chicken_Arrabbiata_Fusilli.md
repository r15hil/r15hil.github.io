## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready


Skim through these steps


Wash your fruit and veg


Note: equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!


Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the diced chicken and chilli flakes (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the quick cook fusilli to a pot <span class="text-highlight">with</span> plenty of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the fusilli for just 2 min (it will keep cooking in the sauce later!)


Once done, drain the fusilli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the garlic paste to the pan with the chicken and cook for 10 sec


Add the chopped tomatoes with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and crumble in the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Add the chipotle paste (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good mix up until fully combined


Cook for 2 min further


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the basil roughly, including the stalks


### Step 6

Add the baby leaf spinach to the pan with the chicken and cook for 1 min, stirring until beginning to wilt


Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your chicken &amp; spinach arrabbiata sauce


### Step 7

Add the drained fusilli to the chicken &amp; spinach arrabbiata sauce with a small splash of the starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up


Cook for 1 min further or until the chicken is cooked through 


Note: please ensure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 8

Set the chicken &amp; spinach arrabbiata fusilli in the centre of the table, ready to share


Top with the grated Italian hard cheese and chopped basil and let everyone dig in


Enjoy!
