## Description

To make this tandoori dish plant-based we've swapped the traditional yoghurt for coconut yoghurt. You'll mix it with curry spices and rub it into cauliflower wedges before roasting. Serve with sultana and lentil rice, flaked almonds and tangy coriander chutney. (Gluten and dairy-free, suitable for coeliacs.)

Chop the cauliflower into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> wedges


### Step 2

Combine the coconut yoghurt, chopped ginger, ground turmeric and curry powder in a large bowl


Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt – this is your tandoori marinade


Using clean hands, add the cauliflower wedges to the tandoori marinade and give it a good mix up until fully covered in marinade


### Step 3

Add the marinated cauliflower to a baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until cooked through and browned

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, add the drained lentils, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana and lentil rice


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Grind the chopped garlic in a pestle &amp; mortar with a pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste


Add the chopped coriander, rice vinegar, chilli flakes (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) a pinch of sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water to the paste and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney


### Step 7

Once the cauliflower is cooked, add the flaked almonds to the tray


Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until toasted

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori cauliflower over the sultana and lentil rice
