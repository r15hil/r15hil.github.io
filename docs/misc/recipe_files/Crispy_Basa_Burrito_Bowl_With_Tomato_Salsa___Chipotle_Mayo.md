### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for a garnish!)

### Step 3

Combine the diced shallot and chopped tomato in a small bowl with the chopped coriander, a drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 4

Add the carrot & cabbage slaw and white wine vinegar to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled slaw

Combine the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo in a separate bowl and mix it all together – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 5

Combine the cornflour and ground smoked paprika on a plate with a generous pinch of salt and mix it all together

Firmly press the basa fillets into the cornflour mixture, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – this is your coated basa

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the vegetable stock mix and give everything a good mix up – this is your seasoned brown rice

### Step 8

Serve the seasoned brown rice in bowls

Top with the tomato salsa, quick-pickled slaw and crispy basa

Drizzle over the chipotle mayo and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
