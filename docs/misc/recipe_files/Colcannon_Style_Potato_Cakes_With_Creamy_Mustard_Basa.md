### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

### Step 2

Meanwhile, wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Grate your cheddar cheese

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain and add to a large bowl, reserving the pot, then mash until smooth

Add half the sliced spring greens (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the bowl with a splash of milk and the grated cheddar

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your potato mix

### Step 4

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Shape the potato mix into 4<span class="text-danger"> </span>patties per person and add them to the tray[s]

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until golden – these are your colcannon-style potato cakes

### Step 5

Add the remaining sliced spring greens to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the spring greens are tender – these are your buttery spring greens

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1678882044402-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate with a pinch of salt, then add your basa fillet[s] to the plate and press into the flour until evenly coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>flour and soft cheese to the pot with your wholegrain mustard, soy sauce and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold water

Bring to a boil and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce begins to thickens – this is your creamy mustard sauce

### Step 8

Serve the crispy basa with the creamy mustard sauce and the colcannon-style potato cakes and buttery spring greens to the side

Enjoy!
