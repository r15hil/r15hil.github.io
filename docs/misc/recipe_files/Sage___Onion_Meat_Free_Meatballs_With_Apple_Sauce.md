### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel, core and roughly chop the apples and add to a pot with a lid with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook, covered, over a medium heat for 10-15 min or until the apples have softened

Once softened, add a knob of butter and mash with a fork until smooth – this is your apple sauce

### Step 2

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min

### Step 3

Top, tail, peel and slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rounds

Chop the sage finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Add the grated onion, meat-free mince and chopped sage to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your meat-free mixture

Divide the meat-free mixture into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12]</span> and shape into meatballs – these are your sage & onion meat-free meatballs

Boil half a kettle

### Step 5

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, add the sage & onion meat-free meatballs and carrot rounds to the tray

Drizzle the carrot rounds with vegetable oil, season with a pinch of salt and return the tray to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until everything is cooked through

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the Marmite – this is your Marmite stock

### Step 6

Once the apple sauce is cooked, transfer it to a bowl and wipe the pot clean

Return the pot to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Add the Marmite stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, cooking for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your gravy

### Step 7

While the gravy is thickening, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

### Step 8

Serve the sage & onion meat-free meatballs with the crispy potatoes, roast carrots, spring greens and apple sauce to the side

Drizzle the gravy all over

Enjoy!
