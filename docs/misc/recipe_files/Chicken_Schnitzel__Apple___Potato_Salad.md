## Ingredients

- 5g chives
- 3 mayonnaise sachets (45ml)
- 1 seasonal British apple 
- 1 British free-range egg
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 20g horseradish cream
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 1 spring onion
- 1 lemon 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Meanwhile, cut the waxy potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces


Add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until they're fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces of chicken


### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger"> </span>into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork


Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper 


Coat the sliced chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then into the beaten egg and finally press it into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to coat everything evenly


### Step 4

Add the mayonnaise to a large mixing bowl with the horseradish cream, the <span class="text-highlight">juice</span> of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar


Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix to combine – this is your lemony horseradish dressing


### Step 5

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Chop the chives finely


Dice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) 


Add the sliced spring onion, chopped chives and diced apple to the bowl of horseradish dressing and set aside


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden


Tip: add more oil if your pan is looking a little dry 


Once cooked, transfer to kitchen paper (keep the pan!) – these are your chicken schnitzel


### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat and cut the <span class="text-highlight">remaining</span> lemon into wedges


Once the pan is hot, add the lemon wedges to the pan and cook for 1 min on each side or until they're slightly browned – these are your caramelised lemons 


Once done, add the drained potatoes to the bowl with the diced apple, spring onion and chopped chives and give everything a gentle mix

### Step 8

Serve the chicken schnitzel over the apple and potato salad


Garnish with the caramelised lemon


Enjoy!
