## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your honey and wholegrain mustard in a bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil – this is your honey-mustard glaze

Wrap each sausage in 1 and 1/2 strips of bacon – these are your pigs in blankets


### Step 3

Add your pigs in blankets to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray

Pour over the honey-mustard glaze and reserve the bowl

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through – these are your honey mustard pigs in blankets


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs with your dried sage and chopped garlic

Cook for 3-4 min or until golden, stirring frequently

Once golden, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan for later – this is your stuffing crumble


### Step 5

Combine your mayo and truffle oil in the reserved bowl – this is your truffle mayo

Slice your apple[s] finely and discard the core[s]

Wash your lamb's lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the lamb's lettuce and sliced apple in a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a little drizzle of olive oil – this is your apple salad


### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Set aside until serving


### Step 7

Once the fries are golden and crisp, remove the tray from the oven and add the stuffing crumble

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray for a final 4-5 min – these are your stuffing fries

### Step 8

Layer your toasted brioche base with some of the apple salad and 2 honey mustard pigs in blankets

Dollop over some of the truffle mayo and top with a toasted brioche lid – this is your honey mustard pigs in blankets brioche

Serve the honey mustard pigs in blankets brioche with the stuffing fries, remaining apple salad and truffle mayo to the side

Enjoy!
