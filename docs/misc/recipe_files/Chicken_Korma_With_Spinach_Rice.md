## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a small plate and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pod[s]


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 5-7 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised

Whilst your onion is caramelising, dissolve your chicken stock mix, chopped creamed coconut, and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped chicken and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned all over

Once lightly browned, add your mango chutney with your ground turmeric, ginger paste, garam masala and cardamom seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken korma


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop roughly


### Step 7

Add the chopped spinach and a pinch of salt to the cooked rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your spinach rice

### Step 8

Serve the chicken korma with the spinach rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!
