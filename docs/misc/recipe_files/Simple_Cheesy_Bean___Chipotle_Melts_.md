## Description

These low-prep, bean-packed cheesy melts take the hassle out of quesadillas! You'll mash kidney beans with mature cheddar and punchy chipotle paste for warmth, before piling the mix into soft tortillas and simply baking in the oven for moreishly melty, fully loaded veggie wraps. Say cheese!

## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (30ml)
- 80g mature cheddar
- 1 can of kidney beans
- 80g natural yoghurt 
- 1 chipotle paste sachets (20g)
- 1 sweet potato
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 2 spring onions 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 6


Cut the sweet potatoes&nbsp;(skins on) into&nbsp;wedges


Add the&nbsp;wedges&nbsp;to a baking tray with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;and a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and give everything a good old mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the&nbsp;wedges&nbsp;are golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese


Drain and rinse the kidney beans


### Step 3

Add the drained&nbsp;kidney&nbsp;beans, chipotle paste,&nbsp;smoked paprika, a very generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil to a pot&nbsp;


Mash until smooth


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">you</span> can use a bowl with a flat bottom instead


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Add the grated cheese to the pot and give everything a good old mix up &ndash; this is your bean mix


### Step 5

Divide the bean mix&nbsp;between the tortilla wraps and spread it out&nbsp;


Fold each&nbsp;tortilla&nbsp;wrap&nbsp;over so you're left with 6 crescent-shaped sandwiches&nbsp;


### Step 6

Add the&nbsp;folded tortilla wraps&nbsp;to a second baking tray


Place the sweet potato baking tray on top of the&nbsp;tortilla baking tray


Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 15-20 min further or until the&nbsp;tortillas&nbsp;are slightly browned and the cheese is melted


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">once</span> the tortillas have 5 min left, remove the sweet potato tray from the tortilla tray and return both trays to the oven separately, allowing the tortillas to crisp slightly&nbsp;


### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim and slice the spring onions finely, keeping the white and green&nbsp;ends separate&nbsp;


Combine the mayonnaise, natural yoghurt and&nbsp;the white&nbsp;ends of the spring onion with a pinch of salt&nbsp;&ndash; this is your spring onion dip


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the tortilla&nbsp;bean melts with the sweet potato wedges and spring onion dip to the side&nbsp;


Garnish with the reserved&nbsp;green spring onion


Enjoy!
