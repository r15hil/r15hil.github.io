### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water

Drain and rinse your kidney beans

### Step 5

Once the onion and pepper have softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the beef mince with your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and dried chilli flakes (cooking for kids? Skip the chilli!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until the beef mince is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 6

Once the beef is browned, add the stock with the drained kidney beans and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min further or until the sauce is thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chilli con carne

### Step 7

Grate your cheddar cheese

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork

Tip: For extra indulgence, add a knob of butter to the rice

### Step 8

Serve the chilli con carne over the cooked rice

Top with the grated cheese, a dollop of natural yoghurt and the sliced spring onion and enjoy!
