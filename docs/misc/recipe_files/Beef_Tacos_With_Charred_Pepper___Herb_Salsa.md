### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until charred and tender

### Step 5

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 7

Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the tomato stock to the pan with a pinch of sugar

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has reduced and the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef taco mix

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Divide the beef taco mix equally between each warmed tortilla and top with the charred pepper & herb salsa
