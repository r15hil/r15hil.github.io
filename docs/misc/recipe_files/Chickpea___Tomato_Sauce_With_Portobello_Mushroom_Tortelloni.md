### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

### Step 4

Once the garlic is fragrant, add the tomato paste and cook for 1 min further

After 1 min, add the Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock and drained chickpeas to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> rosemary sprig<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (save the rest for another recipe!) and cook for 4-5 min or until the chickpeas are tender

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once tender, remove the rosemary and mash half the chickpeas

Season with half the cracked black pepper (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt, give everything a good stir and cook for a further 1 min or until the sauce begins to thicken

### Step 7

Add the drained tortelloni to the pan with half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce - this is your chickpea & tomato sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the chickpea & tomato sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni in bowls

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and cracked black pepper

Enjoy!
