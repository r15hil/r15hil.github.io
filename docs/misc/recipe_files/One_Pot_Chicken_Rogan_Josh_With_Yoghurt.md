### Step 1

Before you begin…

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don’t have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the wedged tomato[es] and onion to the dish with a pinch of salt

Add the crushed garlic and cardamom pods to the dish with your ground turmeric, ground coriander, curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

### Step 6

Sprinkle in your chicken stock mix and add your chopped tomatoes, a pinch of sugar and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water

Add your diced chicken breast and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your one-pot chicken rogan josh

### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once the curry is almost done, discard the cardamom pods

Add your naan[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot chicken rogan josh with the warmed naan to the side

Dollop your natural yoghurt over the top of the chicken rogan josh
