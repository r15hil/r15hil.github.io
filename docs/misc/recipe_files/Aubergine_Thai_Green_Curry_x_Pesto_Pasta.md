### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until golden and tender

### Step 3

Peel and chop your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half

Peel your garlic

Chop your green chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 4

Add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Add the halved shallot and peeled garlic to a food processor with the chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), your basil and a pinch of salt

Add your creamed coconut, the juice of the lime[s], your vegetable stock mix, half your roasted peanuts and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry pesto

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Finely chop the ingredients and grind in a pestle & mortar instead!

### Step 6

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Chop the remaining roasted peanuts roughly

### Step 7

Once the aubergine is tender, add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the Thai green curry pesto, halved tomatoes and a pinch of salt

Add a splash of the reserved pasta water and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated – this is your aubergine Thai green curry x pesto pasta

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine Thai green curry x pesto pasta in a bowl and garnish with the chopped roasted peanuts and your crispy onions

Enjoy!
