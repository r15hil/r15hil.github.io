## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Top, tail and dice your carrot[s] finely

Heat a very large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Add your white cup mushrooms and chestnut mushrooms to a food processor and pulse for 5 secs or until roughly blitzed

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the blitzed mushrooms, chopped garlic and dried oregano to the pan and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook for 3-4 min or until the mushrooms are beginning to soften

Dissolve your tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your soy sauce and Marmite – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Add the tomato stock to the pan with your chopped tomatoes, drained lentils and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 12-15 min or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your mushroom ragù


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your linguine to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Whilst the linguine is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings


### Step 7

Add the drained linguine to the mushroom ragù and gently stir together until the ragù begins to stick to the linguine - this is your rich mushroom ragù linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the rich mushroom ragù linguine

Garnish with the chopped basil, Italian hard cheese shavings and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
