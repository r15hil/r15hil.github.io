## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Trim, then slice your green beans in half (chop them in one bunch for speed!)


### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add your salmon fillet[s] (skin side down!) and the halved green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans are starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your toasted sesame oil, mirin, rice vinegar, white miso paste, ginger paste and soy sauce to a bowl

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water and mix well – this is your miso sauce


### Step 5

Add the miso sauce to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to thicken

Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 6-7 min further or until the salmon is cooked through and the beans are tender – this is your steamed miso salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s] on the diagonal

### Step 8

Serve the steamed miso salmon, miso sauce and softened green beans with the brown rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, black sesame seeds and crispy onions

Enjoy!
