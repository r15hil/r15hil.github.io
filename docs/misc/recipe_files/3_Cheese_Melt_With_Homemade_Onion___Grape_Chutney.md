### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Cut your grapes in half

### Step 2

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and halved grapes with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 4

Once the onions have started to soften, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and your balsamic vinegar and reduce the heat to low

Cook for 10 min or until the onions have caramelised and the sauce has become sticky

Once done, set aside to cool slightly – this is your onion & grape chutney

Tip: Cooling will help to thicken the chutney!

### Step 5

While the chutney is cooking, drain your mozzarella (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!) and tear it into small pieces into a small bowl

Grate your cheddar cheese into the bowl with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) and give it a good mix up – this is your 3 cheese blend

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1599496094337-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the chutney has cooled slightly, fill the halved ciabattas with most of the onion & grape chutney (save a little for later!) and the 3 cheese blend

Spread the top of the filled ciabattas with butter and sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese over the top

Tip: This will give a delicious crust to your cheese melt!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the filled ciabattas, buttered side down, and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (e.g. several cans) to the top pan and cook for 2-3 min per side, checking occasionally – these are your 3 cheese melts with onion & grape chutney

Meanwhile, slice your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 8

Combine the remaining onion & grape chutney with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a large bowl

Add the salad and halved cherry tomatoes to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your salad

Serve the three cheese melts with onion & grape chutney with the crispy potato slices and salad to the side

Enjoy!
