## Description

These tortilla-based pizzas are a quick and easy twist on the Neapolitan classic. By using tortillas for the base, you get that crunchy snap that you can only usually get from a wood-fired oven. The rocket and Italian hard cheese salad sits on top, adding a freshness and a peppery flavour.
