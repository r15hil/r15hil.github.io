## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Red onion
- Halloumi (200g)
- Ras el hanout (1tbsp)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Cooked brown long grain rice (280g)
- Chopped dates (30g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and halved beans and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, slice your halloumi into thin strips (save the halloumi liquid from the packet for later!)

Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp


### Step 5

Wash your spinach and shake off the excess water

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains


### Step 6

Once the onion and beans are slightly softened, add your ras el hanout and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the spinach to the pan with your chopped dates, cooked brown long grain rice, halloumi liquid and a small splash of cold water

Stir it altogether and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until warmed through and the spinach has wilted â€“ this is your fruity spinach pilaf

### Step 8

Serve the fruity spinach pilaf topped with the halloumi slices

Drizzle your natural yoghurt over the top and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
