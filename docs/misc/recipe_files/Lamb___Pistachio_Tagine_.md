## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Add the sliced courgette and sliced garlic to the pan with your ras el hanout, ground cumin and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with half of the tomato stock (save the rest for later!), then cover and set aside until serving


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chopped dates to the pan

Add the remaining tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a stew-like consistency – this is your lamb tagine


### Step 7

While the sauce is thickening, fluff the couscous with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the lamb tagine with the fluffed couscous to the side

Garnish with your pistachio nuts

Enjoy!
