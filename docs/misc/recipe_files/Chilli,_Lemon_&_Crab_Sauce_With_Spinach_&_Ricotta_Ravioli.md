### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and sliced shallot to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 4

Meanwhile, zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

### Step 5

Add your spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spinach & ricotta ravioli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once the shallot and garlic have softened, add your crab meat, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of half your lemon[s] to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the crab is warmed through

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 7

Stir the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli into the sauce and gently stir it together until the pasta is coated – this is your chilli, lemon & crab sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chilli, lemon & crab sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli in bowls with the salad and lemon wedges to the side

Top the salad with the lemon zest (not a fan of lemon? Just add a little!), a little drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
