### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 2

Combine half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and Dijon mustard in a bowl with your cracked black pepper, chopped garlic, the juice of half your lemon[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon & pepper marinade

### Step 3

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

Add the butterflied chicken to the marinade, give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your dried thyme, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Press the marinated chicken into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken

### Step 6

Once the potatoes have had 15 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy lemon & pepper chicken

### Step 7

Whilst the chicken is cooking, wash your baby leaf salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Combine the baby leaf salad and tomato wedges in a bowl with the juice of the remaining lemon, the remaining honey, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the crispy lemon & pepper chicken with the roast potatoes and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
