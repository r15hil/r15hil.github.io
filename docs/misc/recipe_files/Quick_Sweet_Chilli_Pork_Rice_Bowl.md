### Step 1

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pork mince with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Add a little vegetable oil if the pan is looking a little dry
