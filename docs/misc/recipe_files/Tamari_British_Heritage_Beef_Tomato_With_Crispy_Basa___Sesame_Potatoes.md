## Ingredients

- 15ml rice vinegar
- 4 tbsp cornflour
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 British heritage beef tomato
- 30ml tamari soy sauce
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 white potatoes
- 80g spinach
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 22 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the oven, cut the heritage beef tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into thick slices, roughly 1 cm thick

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> as finely as you can

Peel and grate the garlic


### Step 3

Add most of the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish) and grated garlic to a medium bowl with the rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2/3 tamari soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!)

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your tamari marinade


### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the heritage beef tomato slices and cook for 1 min on each side or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!

Add the warmed beef tomato slices to the tamari marinade and gently toss together, then set aside and reserve the pan


### Step 5

While the tomato is marinating, add the basa fillets to a plate and drizzle the remaining tamari soy sauce all over them

Turn the basa several times until the soy sauce fully soaks into the fish

Sprinkle the cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated, then set aside for later

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!


### Step 6

When the potatoes are almost done, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden, crisp and cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

After the initial 22 min, remove the potatoes from the oven and wash the spinach

Top the potatoes with the spinach and return the tray to the oven for a final 3 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once done, drizzle the toasted sesame oil all over the potatoes and spinach and mix everything together – these are your sesame potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the sesame potatoes with the tamari heritage beef tomato to the side

Pour the remaining tamari marinade all over the beef tomato and top with the crispy basa

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
