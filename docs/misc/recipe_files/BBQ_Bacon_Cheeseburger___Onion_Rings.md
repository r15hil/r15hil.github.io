## Ingredients

- Smoked streaky bacon (45g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- BBQ sauce (40g)
- Cornflour (1tsp) x0
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your burger patty[ies] to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven and cook for an initial 20 min

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Slice your cheddar (3 slices per person!)

Wash, then remove leaves from your lettuce (1 per person!) and set aside, shred the inner core[s]

Combine a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl with your white wine vinegar and a generous pinch of sugar – this is your dressing

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad


### Step 4

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into thick discs (roughly 1cm thick), then pop out the centres so that you have different sized discs

Add the onion discs to a bowl with a handful of flour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated – this is your floured onion

Combine your cornflour and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour in a small bowl with 45ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[90ml] </span>water and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your batter


### Step 5

Once the burger[s] have had 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and flip the burger patty[ies] over

Add your smoked streaky bacon to the other side of the tray[s] and drizzle over half your BBQ sauce (you’ll use the rest later!)

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10 min or until the bacon is starting to crisp and the burger is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your burger and BBQ glazed bacon


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, reduce the heat to medium-high, then dip the floured onion into the batter and turn several times until fully coated

Add the coated onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through, golden and crispy – these are your onion rings


### Step 7

Once the burger and BBQ glazed bacon is ready, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Top the burger[s] with the sliced cheddar and drizzle over the remaining BBQ sauce

Add your brioche bun[s] to the tray[s] and return to the oven for a final 2 min or until the cheese has melted and the bun is warmed through

### Step 8

Top the warmed brioche base with a lettuce leaf

Add the cheesy BBQ burger followed by the BBQ glazed bacon and a few onion rings and top with a warmed brioche lid

Serve the dressed salad and chips to the side with any remaining onion rings

Enjoy!
