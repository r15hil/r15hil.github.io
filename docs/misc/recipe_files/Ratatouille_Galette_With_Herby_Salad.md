Here's a twist on two French classics. Spread the ratatouille base over puff pastry, and fan sliced veg over the top to pack it with goodness. Top with fresh basil and serve with a dressed salad.

## Ingredients

- Yellow pepper
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Basil (10g)
- Basil (5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato
- Courgette
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Top, tail and cut your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Dice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely


### Step 2

Add the chopped veg to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic and dried oregano and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock and chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-9 min or until starting to thicken, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool – this is your tomato sauce

While the sauce is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)


### Step 5

Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour and unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to the tray, then prick the inside of the pastry all over with a fork (this will stop you from getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 6

Spread the tomato sauce over the pastry, leaving a 2cm border

Top with the roasted veg, then fold the pastry border over the edge of the filling

Tip: Start from one corner and work around in one direction, overlapping the pastry each time

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up – this is your ratatouille galette


### Step 7

While the galette is cooking, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your red wine vinegar to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add the salad and chopped basil to the bowl and toss – this is your herby salad

### Step 8

Cut the ratatouille galette in half and tear over the reserved basil leaves

Serve the halved ratatouille galette with the herby salad to the side

Enjoy!
