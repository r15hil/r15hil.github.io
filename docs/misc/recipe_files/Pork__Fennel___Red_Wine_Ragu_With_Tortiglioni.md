### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Whilst the pork is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix, red wine paste and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red wine stock

### Step 3

Once the pork has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add the chopped shallot and cook for a further 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with your fennel seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes to the pan with the red wine stock and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork, fennel & red wine ragu

### Step 7

Once the ragu has thickened, stir through the drained tortiglioni with a splash of starchy pasta water, a knob of butter and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your pork, fennel & red wine ragu with tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the pork, fennel & red wine ragu with tortiglioni 

Garnish with the cheese shavings and chopped parsley
