## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut, lengthways into wedges


Add the harissa and honey to a large bowl and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your marinade


Add the aubergine wedges to the marinade and coat well


Transfer the coated aubergine wedges to a baking tray, drizzle them with olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until browned and softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the green beans roughly


Add the beans to a pot of cold water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite 


Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and set aside


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic 


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 5 min or until softened


Add the ground cumin and chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min


### Step 6

Add the lentils, cooked green beans and half the chopped coriander to the onions with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


Cook for 2-3 min or until the lentils are warmed through


Add the cooked rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your Persian rice


### Step 7
