## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 1 white potato
- 320g blanched peas
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 10g mint
- 0 mint
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel your potato[es] and chop into very small pieces

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your portobello mushroom[s] to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden

Meanwhile, set some butter aside near a warm place to get to room temperature for easy spreading later on

Boil a full kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large pot with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is beginning to soften

Add the chopped potato, chopped garlic and bay leaf[ves] and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 4

Once softened, add your vegetable stock mix into the pan and add 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Slice your cheddar cheese into 2 slices per person

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and butter the base[s]


### Step 5

Remove the baking tray[s] from the oven

Add 1 golden portobello mushroom to each ciabatta base and layer 2 slices of cheddar cheese on top

Add both the loaded ciabatta base[s] and ciabatta lid[s] (cut side up) to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add your mint leaves and blanched peas to the pot and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 7

Remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaf[ves]

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your minted pea soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Sandwich the loaded ciabatta base and ciabatta lid together and cut in half diagonally – this is your cheese & mushroom toastie

Serve the minted pea soup in bowls with the cheese & mushroom toastie to the side

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
