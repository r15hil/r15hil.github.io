### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and chop lengthways into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> wedges

Transfer the aubergine wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the aubergine is tender and lightly golden

### Step 2

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot

Top, tail and peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Wash the gem lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the root<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the lettuce and discard, then separate the leaves and set them aside until serving

### Step 6

After the initial 20 min, add half of the zingy ginger & orange dressing to the aubergine along with the Tenderstem broccoli

Cook for 10 min further or until the broccoli is tender – this is your zingy ginger & orange veg

Add the sesame oil and cider vinegar to the remaining zingy ginger & orange dressing

### Step 7

Slice the radishes as finely as you can

Slice the cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Add the sliced radishes and cucumber matchsticks to the cooked brown rice with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your brown rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the zingy ginger & orange veg over the brown rice salad with the reserved lettuce leaves and carrot ribbons to the side

Drizzle the reserved zingy ginger & orange dressing all over

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
