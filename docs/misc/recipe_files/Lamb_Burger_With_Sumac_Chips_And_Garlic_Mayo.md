### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Whilst the chips are in the oven, peel and grate the garlic

### Step 3

Combine the lamb mince with half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>and shape into equal-sized patties

### Step 4

Combine the mayo and remaining grated garlic in a separate bowl with half the ground sumac (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your garlic mayo

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb patties, press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!) – these are your lamb burgers

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the cider vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash the gem lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> outer leaves and set aside, then cut the inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Add the lettuce wedges to the dressing and give everything a good mix up – these are your dressed lettuce wedges

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1678972917774-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once everything is almost ready, add the ciabattas to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty

Carefully slice them in half before serving

When the chips are golden and crisp, sprinkle the remaining ground sumac over the chips and give everything a good mix up – these are your sumac chips

### Step 8

Top each warmed ciabatta base with some garlic mayo, 2 outer lettuce leaves, a lamb burger and the warmed ciabatta lid

Serve the sumac chips, dressed lettuce wedges and any remaining garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
