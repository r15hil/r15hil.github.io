### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Top, tail and slice the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into medium rounds and peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

While the leek is softening, roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Strip the thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Drain and rinse the butter beans

### Step 4

Once the leek and shallot are slightly softened, add the butternut squash cubes, drained butter beans and chopped garlic to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> flour

Add the chopped thyme and bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>

Give everything and good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Add the single soya and vegetable stock mix to the pan with 80ml <span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>boiled water and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until slightly thickened – this is your creamy veg mixture

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1640087292006-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Transfer the creamy veg mixture to an oven-proof dish

Carefully top with the softened potato discs (beware, they will be hot!)

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is bubbling and the potatoes are golden and cooked through – this is your plant-based winter squash & leek hotpot

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Once the hotpot has been cooking for 10 min, boil half a kettle

Chop the Tenderstem broccoli in half

Add the halved Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain

### Step 8

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the plant-based winter squash & leek hotpot with the Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!
