- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Onion marmalade (20g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Peel and dice half your potatoes into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, grated carrot and diced potato to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until everything is beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the vegetables are softening, cut the remaining potato[es] (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 4

Once the vegetables have slightly softened, add your vegetable stock mix and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water

Add your Henderson's Relish and half your onion marmalade (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for a further 1-2 min or until the vegetables are tender – this is your pasty filling


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and add the pastry square[s]

Add the pasty filling to one corner of the pastry square[s] and fold the corner over to make a triangle shape


### Step 6

Crimp the edges with a fork to seal the pasty[ies]

Put the pasty[ies] in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your plant-based pasty

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and remaining onion marmalade in a small bowl – this is your onion marmalade dip


### Step 7

While the pasty is cooking, combine your cider vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressing and toss – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based pasty with the chips, salad and onion marmalade dip to the side

Enjoy!
