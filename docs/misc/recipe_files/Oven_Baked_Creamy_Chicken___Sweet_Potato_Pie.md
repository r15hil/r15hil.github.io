## Ingredients

- 0 chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 80g crème fraîche
- 1 puff pastry
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 160g blanched peas
- 1 sweet potato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and your dried thyme and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped sweet potato, chicken stock mix, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potato is tender


### Step 5

Once everything's been in the oven for 12 min, dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour

Roll out your puff pastry to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and add to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your pie lid


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your crème fraîche, blanched peas and Dijon mustard

Top with the pie lid – this is your creamy chicken & sweet potato pie

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken & sweet potato pie

Let everyone dig in!
