## Ingredients

- British chicken breast portion x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Gluten free brioche buns (2pcs)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Spring onion
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!), with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and season with your dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby potatoes


### Step 3

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a plate with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season generously with salt and pepper

Refrigerate until later


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the sliced spring onion to a bowl with your mayo, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), white wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut side up, and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

### Step 8

To assemble, fill the warmed brioche with the spiced chicken, a dollop of garlic mayo and a handful of shredded lettuce – this is your spiced chicken sandwich

Serve the herby potatoes to the side with the remaining shredded lettuce and drizzle over the remaining garlic mayo

Enjoy!
