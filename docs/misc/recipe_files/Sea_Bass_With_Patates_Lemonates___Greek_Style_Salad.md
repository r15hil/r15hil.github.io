- Sea bass fillets (2pcs)
- Feta (30g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin wedges

Peel thin strips of zest from your lemon[s] (avoid the white bitter pith)

Chop 2/3 of the red onion[s] into wedges, reserve the remaining red onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add the potato & onion wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with half your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the potatoes have slightly browned


### Step 3

While the potatoes are in the oven, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Slice the remaining red onion finely

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice roughly


### Step 4

Add the juice from half the peeled lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [2 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[3 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon dressing


### Step 5

Add the chopped cucumber, sliced onion, your black olives and chopped cherry tomatoes to the dressing

Crumble your feta in roughly, add your remaining dried oregano and toss – this is your Greek-style salad


### Step 6

Once the potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the lemon zest strips with a squeeze of lemon juice, the chopped garlic and a knob of butter dotted all over

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 10 min or until golden and slightly caramelised – these are your patatas lemonatas

Cut the squeezed lemon half[ves] into wedges


### Step 7

Score your sea bass fillet[s] by drawing a sharp knife through the skin 3 times on the diagonal, taking care not to cut all the way through, then season both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat, then once hot, add the scored sea bass fillet[s], skin side down, and cook for 5 min, then turn and cook for 1 min further until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried sea bass with the Greek-style salad and patatas lemonatas to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
