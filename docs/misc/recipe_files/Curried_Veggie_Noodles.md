## Description

We’ve based these noodles on one of our favourite Chinese street food stalls. There’s something about the sauce and sticky noodles that makes eating them both very messy and extremely pleasurable. The curried coconut sauce dresses the noodles in a slick silky sauce, while the vegetables are quickly stir-fried to retain crunch.
