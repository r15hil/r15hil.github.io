## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Add 60g <span class="text-purple">[90g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour to a bowl along with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), white wine vinegar and a very generous pinch of salt

Add 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>very cold water and mix thoroughly – this is your spicy batter

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate


### Step 3

Drain, then pat your king prawns dry with kitchen paper (get them as dry as you can!)


### Step 4

Dip the drained king prawns in the spicy batter, tap off any excess, then add them to the panko breadcrumbs (turn several times to coat completely) – these are your breaded king prawns


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to fully coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the breaded king prawns to the pan and cook for 6-8 min, turning once halfway, until your prawns are cooked through and crispy – these are your bang bang king prawns

Tip: Do the prawns in batches if you need to so you don't overcrowd the pan!


### Step 6

Whilst the prawns are cooking, add your mayo to a bowl with the juice of half your lime[s]

Give it a good mix up – this is your zingy mayo


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Slice the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the shredded lettuce with the bang bang king prawns on top

Drizzle over the zingy mayo and garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge

Serve the chips to the side

Enjoy!
