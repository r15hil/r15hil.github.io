### Step 4

Once the onion has started to soften, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan stirring to coat the grains of rice in the oil

Add your chopped tomatoes and stir continuously until the rice has absorbed most of the tomato juice

### Step 5

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your tomato risotto

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Grind most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with olive oil

### Step 7

Once the risotto is almost done, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Drain your king prawns

Once hot, add the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until coloured and cooked through, then season lightly with pepper

Once the risotto is cooked, add your red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 2 min

### Step 8

Add the cooked prawns and grated cheese to the tomato risotto and gently stir it all together – this is your tomato & king prawn risotto

Serve the tomato & king prawn risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Drizzle the basil oil all over

Enjoy!
