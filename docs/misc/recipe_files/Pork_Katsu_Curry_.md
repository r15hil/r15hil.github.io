## Description

If you like the flavour of curry, but aren’t a fan of heat then this Japanese-style pork is for (kats)YOU! Our lightly pickled salad is just the ticket to counterbalance the textures and richness. If you’re keen on presentation, spoon your rice into a small bowl, press it in firmly, and then turn out to form a perfect circular shape.

Heat 2-3 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large pan
