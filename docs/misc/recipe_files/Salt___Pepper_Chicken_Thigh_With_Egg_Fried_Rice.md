## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help cool down


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, add your cornflour to a bowl along with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a very generous pinch of salt, your five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together

Add your diced chicken thigh to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until all the chicken is coated


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken pieces and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken thigh


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, trim, then roughly chop your spring onions into batons

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds


### Step 5

Once the chicken is crispy, add the spring onion batons, chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 2-3 min until fragrant

Once done, transfer everything to a plate (save the pan!) and set aside until serving – this is your salt & pepper chicken thigh


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooled rice, your blanched peas, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined


### Step 7

Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the salt & pepper chicken thigh over the egg fried rice

Enjoy!
