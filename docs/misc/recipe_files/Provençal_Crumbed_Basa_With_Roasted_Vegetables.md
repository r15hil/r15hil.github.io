## Ingredients

- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Cheese flavour slices (2pcs)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Parsley (10g)
- Parsley (5g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Courgette

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until beginning to turn golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and dice your courgette[s]

Add the diced courgette to a bowl with your dried oregano, a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once the potatoes have had 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the halved tomatoes

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray to the oven for a further 10 min


### Step 4

While the vegetables are in the oven, tear your cheese flavour slice

Combine the torn cheeze and panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl – these are your cheezy breadcrumbs


### Step 5

After 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the diced courgette

Top the courgette with your basa fillet[s] and press the cheezy breadcrumbs onto the fish

Return the tray to the oven for 12-15 min further or until the breadcrumbs are crisp and golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Provençal crumbed basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 7

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and chopped parsley to a small bowl with a generous pinch of salt and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Stir it all together – this is your garlic & parsley oil

### Step 8

Serve the Provençal crumbed basa over the roasted vegetables

Drizzle the garlic & parsley oil all over

Enjoy!
