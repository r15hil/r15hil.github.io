## Description

Pork Pibil is a traditional Mexican slow-roasted pork dish flavoured with citrus fruit and allspice. Our (slightly) quicker version roasts pork belly in both the juice and zest of an orange before serving it in smashed black bean, pickled shallot and cheddar cheese tacos. Mmm... Mexcellent!
