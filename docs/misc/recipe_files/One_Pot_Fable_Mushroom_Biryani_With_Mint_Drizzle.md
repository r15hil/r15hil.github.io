## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large pot (with a lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until beginning to brown


### Step 2

While the mushrooms are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the mushrooms are slightly browned, reduce the heat to low and break them up with a wooden spoon

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter alternative with the sliced shallot and chopped garlic

Add your garam masala, curry powder and ginger paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> cold water with your vegetable stock mix and sultanas


### Step 5

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, give it a good mix up, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for 13-16 min or until the rice is cooked

Tip: Stir halfway through, to stop it sticking!


### Step 6

Once cooked, add your blanched peas (don't stir!)

Put the lid back on and set aside for 4-6 min or until the peas are warmed through

Once warmed through, give everything a good mix up – this is your one pot Fable mushroom biryani


### Step 7

Combine your mint sauce and mayo in small bowl – this is your minty drizzle

### Step 8

Top the one pot Fable mushroom biryani with the minty drizzle

Season with a grind of pepper
