## Ingredients

- Panko breadcrumbs (20g) x0
- Chives (5g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Cornflour (1tsp) x0
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml) x2
- Plain tofu (280g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Shallot
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your waxy potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are crispy and cooked through – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper, then slice the tofu into 2 pieces per person

Add the sliced tofu to a bowl with your soy sauce and wholegrain mustard

Give everything a good mix up, then set aside for later – this is your mustard marinated tofu


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Finely chop your chives

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Trim your green beans


### Step 4

Add the diced shallot to a large bowl with the juice of half the lemon wedges and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for 1-2 min

After 1-2 min, add your mayo to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your quick-pickled shallot mayo


### Step 5

Add your cornflour to the mustard marinated tofu with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with your ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt – these are your smoky breadcrumbs

Press the mustard marinated tofu into the smoky breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your smoky breaded tofu


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the smoky breaded tofu and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until browned – this is your tofu schnitzel


### Step 7

While the tofu is cooking, add the trimmed green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once the potatoes are done, add the crispy potatoes and chopped chives to the quick-pickled shallot mayo and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the tofu schnitzel with the quick-pickled potato salad and cooked green beans to the side

Garnish with a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!
