### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop the waxy potatoes in half

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot and keep covered until later

Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber

Meanwhile, combine the gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water in a small bowl and mix well – this is your gochujang mixture

Once the spring onions are soft, add the drained potatoes and gochujang mixture to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Serve the cheesy gochujang potatoes with fried egg with the tangy slaw to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander, toasted sesame seeds and a lime wedge
