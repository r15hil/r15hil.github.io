### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Add your cumin seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Transfer the toasted cumin seeds to a pestle & mortar (save the pan for later!)

### Step 3

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Meanwhile, slice your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop into bite-size pieces

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 5

Add the chopped coriander, toasted cumin seeds, chopped ginger, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1/3 of the chopped garlic in the pestle & mortar and grind to a smooth paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and your rice vinegar then season generously with salt and pepper – this is your green chutney

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and remaining chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Add the chopped courgette and cook for 6-8 min or until tender

### Step 7

Once the courgette is cooked, fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork and add to the pan

Break your goats' cheese into chunks

Stir half of the goats' cheese chunks and half of the green chutney through the bulgur (save the rest for the garnish!) – this is your goats' cheese & bulgur salad

### Step 8

Serve the goats' cheese & bulgur salad with the remaining goats' cheese chunks and green chutney over the top

Enjoy!
