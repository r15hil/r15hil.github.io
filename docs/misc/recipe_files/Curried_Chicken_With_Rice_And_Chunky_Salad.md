Add the chopped garlic, the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your curry marinade

### Step 3

Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving

Meanwhile, transfer the marinated chicken and onion to an oven-proof dish with any remaining curry marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and is beginning to brown – this is your curried chicken

### Step 7

Add your flaked almonds to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until lightly golden and toasted – these are your toasted almonds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Add the toasted almonds to the drained brown rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your almond rice

### Step 8

Serve the curried chicken over the almond rice with the chunky salad and remaining natural yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!
