## Ingredients

- 60g black olives
- 0 tomato paste
- 0 basa fillet
- 1 tomato
- 0 orzo
- 32g tomato paste
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 20g capers
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 150g orzo
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 5g parsley
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 2

Chop your capers roughly

Chop your black olives in half

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Once softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped capers and halved olives

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and chopped tomato to the pan with your orzo, a pinch of sugar and a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min or until almost cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped parsley and remaining chopped garlic in a bowl with your white wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your gremolata


### Step 7

Once the orzo is almost cooked, add your basa fillet[s] to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 5 min or until the basa is cooked through and the orzo is tender – this is your basa puttanesca orzo

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Season the basa puttanesca orzo with a grind of black pepper

Drizzle over the gremolata

Enjoy!
