## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine kernel & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, remove from the pan and set aside for later


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Add your lamb mince and ground cinnamon (don't like cinnamon? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 4 min or until starting to crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Once crisp, add the chopped garlic, your tomato paste and dried oregano, then cook for 1 min

Add the chicken stock, your orzo and bay leaf[ves], then season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 12-14 min or until the orzo is tender and the lamb mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)– this is your spiced lamb orzo

Tip: Stir the orzo halfway through so it doesn't stick to the pan


### Step 7

Meanwhile, crumble your feta

### Step 8

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Serve the spiced lamb orzo

Garnish with the toasted pine kernels & seeds and crumbled feta

Enjoy!
