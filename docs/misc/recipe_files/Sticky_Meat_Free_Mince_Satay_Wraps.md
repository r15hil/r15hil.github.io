### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

### Step 4

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice into batons

### Step 5

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine your peanut butter, red chilli relish, half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), the juice of the lime[s], a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your satay sauce

### Step 6

Once the meat-free mince has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste, honey, Chinese rice wine, the remaining soy sauce and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the meat-free mince has cooked through – this is your sticky meat-free mince

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1627985498136-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 1-2 min, or until the tortillas are warmed through

Add most of the satay sauce (save some for later!) to the sticky meat-free mince and mix until well coated

### Step 8

Divide the sticky meat-free mince between the warmed tortillas and top with the grated carrot and cucumber batons

Drizzle over the remaining satay sauce and garnish with the reserved chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
