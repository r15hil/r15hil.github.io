## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the heritage tomatoes in half and add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften, then remove from the oven and set aside

### Step 2

While the tomatoes are in the oven, cut the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a separate baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely slice the red onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 2 min

Reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 4

Meanwhile, unroll the puff pastry and cut it into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> squares

Transfer the pastry squares to a sheet of non-stick baking paper (the size of a baking tray!)

Score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)

### Step 5

Once the onions are caramelised, add half the balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min further until all the vinegar has absorbed into the onion – these are your caramelised onions

Remove the roasted tomatoes from the baking tray and set aside, reserving the tray

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2114.-step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the pastry squares to the reserved baking tray

Top the centre of pastry squares with the grated Italian hard cheese, caramelised onion and roasted tomatoes

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the pastry is golden and crisp and the edges have puffed up – these are your tomato & caramelised onion tarts

### Step 7

While the tarts are in the oven, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic vinegar dressing

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the tomato & caramelised onion tarts with the crispy potatoes and rocket to the side

Drizzle the salad with the balsamic vinegar dressing and garnish the tarts with the chopped basil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
