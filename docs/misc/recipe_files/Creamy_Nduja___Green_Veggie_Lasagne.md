-  'Nduja (40g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Lasagne sheets (120g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g)
- Brussels sprouts (100g)
- Garlic clove
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and dice finely

Trim the ends off your Brussels sprouts, then chop in half lengthways and chop your Tenderstem broccoli into thirds

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced leek to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 6-7 min or until softened

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 3

Once the leek has softened, add the chopped garlic and Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped Brussels sprouts and chopped Tenderstem broccoli

Give everything a good mix up – these are your green veggies


### Step 4

Heat 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 5

Remove the béchamel sauce from the heat

Tear your ‘Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the béchamel sauce

Add your ground smoked paprika and vegetable stock mix to the pot and whisk everything together until well combined – this is your ‘Nduja béchamel


### Step 6

Layer 1/3 of the green veggies over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, top with 1/3 of your lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta, then top with 1/3 of the ‘Nduja béchamel

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of 'Nduja béchamel

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish!

Top with the grated cheese


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked – this is your creamy 'Nduja & green veggie lasagne

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

### Step 8

Serve the creamy ‘Nduja & green veggie lasagne

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!
