## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Cut the broccoli into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12]</span> wedges, lengthways


Cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)


### Step 2

Add the broccoli and onion wedges to a baking tray with the butternut squash cubes


Drizzle everything with vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt


### Step 3

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until everything is golden and tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, reserve a cup of starchy noodle water, then drain and return them to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Combine the miso paste, tahini, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, agave nectar, rice vinegar and chopped ginger in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your sesame &amp; ginger dressing


### Step 6

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Finely slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are cooked, carefully cut off the onion root and remove the skins 


Add the cooked butternut squash, red onion petals, a splash of noodle water and half the <span class="text-highlight">sesame &amp; ginger</span> dressing to the noodles 


Give everything a good mix up until well coated

### Step 8

Serve the roasted broccoli wedges over the noodles


Drizzle with the remaining dressing 


Garnish with the black sesame seeds, sliced <span class="text-highlight">chilli</span><span class="text-highlight"> (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and</span> spring onion 


Enjoy!
