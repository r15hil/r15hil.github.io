### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Line a medium deep baking tray or oven-proof dish with baking paper and add 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use a larger deep tray or dish!

Add the Cumberland sausages and put the tray on the top shelf of the oven for an initial 10 min or until the sausages are starting to brown slightly and the oil is hot

### Step 2

Meanwhile, strip the thyme leaves from their stalks and chop the leaves finely

Combine the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with 35g<span class="text-danger"> [70g] </span>plain flour and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>milk and whisk in half the chopped thyme (save the rest for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your herby batter

Put the herby batter in the fridge to rest

### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Add the onion wedges to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Once the sausages have had 10 min, add the tray of onion wedges to the bottom shelf of the oven for 20 min or until softened

### Step 4

Remove the sausage tray from the oven and carefully pour the herby batter into it

Return the tray to the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through and the Yorkshire pudding has puffed up

Tip: Don't peek! Opening the oven might make your giant Yorkie collapse!

Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock mix and Marmite in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 5

Heat a pot with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour with the remaining chopped thyme and cook for 30 secs until a paste forms

Add the stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 6-8 min or until thickened – this is your gravy

Once thickened, remove the gravy from the heat and set aside

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Once everything's almost done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1618925922433-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and garlic and cook for 1 min

Add a small splash of cold water and cook for 2 min further

Add the blanched peas and cook for a final 1 min until everything's tender

Remove the roasted onion wedges from the oven and add them to the pot of gravy, then return to the hob to reheat – this is your roasted onion gravy

### Step 8

Serve the herby toad in the hole with the garlicky greens to the side

Drizzle the roasted onion gravy all over

Enjoy!
