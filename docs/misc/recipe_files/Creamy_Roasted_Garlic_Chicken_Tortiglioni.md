## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 1 tomato
- 100g crème fraîche
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 5g chives
- 200g tortiglioni
- 50g rocket
- 4 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a full kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Cut 1 piece<span class="text-danger"> </span>of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper

Lay the garlic cloves (skins on) in the middle of the paper, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt, then scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the garlic to form a sealed parcel


### Step 2

Add the chicken breast portions to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, the dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the garlic parcel to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, add the tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni and drizzle with a little olive oil in the colander, reserve the pot


### Step 4

Chop the chives finely

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 5

Combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your balsamic dressing


### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the crème fraîche, chicken stock and half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken

Once the chicken is done, carefully squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins and mash with a fork, discard the skins

Return the drained tortiglioni and mashed roasted garlic to the pot and mix it all up – this is your creamy roasted garlic tortiglioni


### Step 7

Slice the cooked chicken finely

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket and diced tomato to the balsamic dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic salad

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken over the creamy roasted garlic tortiglioni with the balsamic salad to the side

Garnish with the chopped chives and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
