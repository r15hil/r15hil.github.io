- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries, then toss them in a bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Transfer the fries to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until they're cooked through and crisp


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your soy sauce and chopped garlic to the pan with a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways until you have thin strips

Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks


### Step 5

Combine your mayo and red chilli relish in a small bowl – this is your chilli mayo


### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mix the pulled chicken into the pan juices

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, spread the chilli mayo over a toasted brioche base, top with the pulled chicken, crispy onions, cucumber matchsticks, spring onion strips and finally a brioche lid – this is your Asian-style chicken burger

Sprinkle the fries with your toasted sesame seeds and serve them with any remaining chilli mayo, cucumber matchsticks and spring onion strips to the side

Enjoy!
