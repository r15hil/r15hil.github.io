### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Trim your leek[s], wash thoroughly to remove any grit, then top, tail and slice finely into rounds

Add the sliced leek to a large oven-proof dish

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced garlic to the oven-proof dish

### Step 4

Chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to the oven-proof dish and top with your gnocchi

### Step 5

Mix half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and your cornflour until fully combined

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water, your soft cheese and a generous grind of black pepper

Stir it all together – this is your creamy sauce

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1728913024621-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Pour the creamy sauce over the gnocchi and sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until bubbling, golden and cooked through – this is your all-in-one smoky basa gnocchi gratin

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

While the gratin is cooking, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Once done, remove the all-in-one smoky basa gnocchi gratin from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!), then season to taste

Garnish with the salad

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper to the salad

Dig in!
