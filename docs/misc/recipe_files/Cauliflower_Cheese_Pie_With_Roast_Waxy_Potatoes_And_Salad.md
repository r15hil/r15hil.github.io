### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your cauliflower into florets and the stem[s] into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the cauliflower florets and chopped stem[s] to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until beginning to soften

Whilst the cauliflower is in the oven, grate your cheddar cheese and Italian hard cheese

Peel and grate your garlic

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

### Step 3

Combine the grated cheddar and half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) with your cornflour in a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) and mix until the cheese is coated in the flour

Add 175ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>milk to the pan with the bay leaf[ves], half the Dijon mustard (save the rest for later!) a pinch of salt and pepper, then cook over a medium heat for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your cheese sauce

### Step 4

Add the halved potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with your dried thyme, 2/3 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden

### Step 6

Once softened, remove the dish from the oven and mix the cheese sauce through the roasted cauliflower

Top the dish with the rolled pastry, brush with a little milk and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Return the dish to the oven for a further 20 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your cauliflower cheese pie

### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and toss through the mustard dressing – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the cauliflower cheese pie with the roast waxy potatoes and dressed salad to the side

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Enjoy!
