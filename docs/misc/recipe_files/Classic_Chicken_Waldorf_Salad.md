The history of this iconic salad dates back to 1896 when the Waldorf Hotel in New York concocted this fruity number. Apple, sultanas and grapes are tumbled through a creamy dressing, with walnuts adding earthiness, chicken for protein and croutons for crunch!

## Ingredients

- 1 cosberg heart lettuce
- 1 tsp Italian dried oregano
- 4 British chicken thigh fillets
- 1 apple 
- 30g walnuts 
- 1 ciabatta roll
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml)
- 1 celery stick
- 100g red seedless grapes 
- 30g sultanas
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 350&deg;F/ Gas 4


Heat a large, <span class="text-highlight">wide-based pan</span> (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chicken thigh fillets with the dried&nbsp;oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min, turning once halfway, until golden on both sides


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Add the mayonnaise to a bowl with the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and a drizzle of olive oil


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your creamy dressing


### Step 3

Once the chicken is golden, reduce the heat to low, add a splash of water, cover with a lid and&nbsp;cook for 10-12 min or until it's cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) into bite-sized pieces


Add the diced apple to a very large bowl with the juice of the remaining lemon


Tip: the lemon juice&nbsp;prevents the apple from going brown!


Add the sultanas to a small bowl and cover them with&nbsp;boiled water (this plumps them up)


### Step 5

Cut the ciabatta roll<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small, bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Add the ciabatta&nbsp;to one side of the baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;


Add the walnuts to the other side of the baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until they've darkened slightly in colour and toasted&nbsp;


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice the celery&nbsp;as finely as you can


Cut the red grapes in half&nbsp;


Tear the cosberg lettuce&nbsp;into rough, bite-size pieces


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, shred the chicken apart in the pan, using two forks - this technique is known as &lsquo;pulling'


Drain the sultanas


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Add&nbsp;all of the&nbsp;ingredients, including the creamy dressing, to the large&nbsp;bowl with the apple and&nbsp;give everything a good old mix up - this is your waldorf salad


Serve the waldorf salad


Enjoy!
