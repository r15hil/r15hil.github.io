### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop your halloumi into small cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped halloumi

### Step 3

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Add the sliced shallot[s] to the pan and cook the halloumi for a further 2-3 min on each side or until browned and the shallot is slightly softened

### Step 4

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely

### Step 5

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 6

Once the halloumi is browned, add your chipotle paste, half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the sliced garlic and ground smoked paprika

Stir it all together and add your chopped tomatoes with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your spicy halloumi rancheros

### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, cut the toasted ciabatta[s] into triangles

### Step 8

Serve the spicy halloumi rancheros with the sliced avocado and toasted ciabatta triangles to the side

Top the halloumi rancheros with the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and drizzle the avocado with a little olive oil and season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
