## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness


### Step 2

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>flour to a plate

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, then add to the milk and finally firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Transfer to a clean board, cover with a tea towel to keep warm and reserve the pan – this is your chicken Milanese


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Reboil half a kettle

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water

Add your dried oregano, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Wipe the reserved pan and return to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and tomato stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly thickened

Once slightly thickened, add the drained spaghetti with a splash of starchy pasta water and cook for a final 1 min or until the spaghetti is well coated – this is your spaghetti pomodoro

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Slice the chicken Milanese thinly on a clean board

Serve the spaghetti pomodoro topped with the sliced chicken Milanese and grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
