### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Cut the potatoes (skin on) into small, bite-sized cubes

Add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your parmentier potatoes

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with the pickled red cabbage and a drizzle of olive oil, then give everything a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your cabbage slaw

Drizzle over the chipotle mayo and garnish with the sliced spring onion and cubed feta

Enjoy!
