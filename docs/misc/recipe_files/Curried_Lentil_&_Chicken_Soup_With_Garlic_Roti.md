### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s]

Cut the remaining onion into wedges

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pot (with a matching lid) with a little drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and carrot discs and cook for 4-6 min or until starting to soften

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the onion wedges to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over a pinch of your curry powder (you'll use the rest later) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a little drizzle of olive oil

Add your chicken breast strips to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion wedges are caramelised and slightly charred – this is your roasted chicken & onion

### Step 4

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the onion is softened, add a knob of butter to the pot with your tomato paste, the remaining curry powder and half the garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the red lentils with 650ml <span class="text-purple">[850ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water and your chicken stock mix to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook covered for 15-20 min or until the lentils and carrot have softened

Once softened, remove the pot from the heat and blitz with a (stick) blender until smooth, then return to a low heat to keep warm – this is your curried lentil soup

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board, reserve the tray[s] and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Separate the roasted onion into petals – these are your tandoori-style onion petals

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1667320662806-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the remaining chopped garlic in a bowl with a small pinch of salt – this is your garlic oil

Discard the tin foil, then add your roti to the reserved baking tray[s]

Spread your garlic oil over the roti until evenly coated

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through – these are your garlic roti

### Step 8

Serve the curried lentil soup and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Top with the pulled chicken and tandoori-style onion petals – this is your curried lentil & chicken soup

Serve the garlic roti to the side

Enjoy!
