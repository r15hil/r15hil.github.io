- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Baby button mushrooms (80g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Slice your flat white mushroom[s] and baby button mushrooms finely


### Step 2

Heat a large pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until the onion is softened


### Step 3

While the onion and mushrooms are cooking, peel your potato[es] and chop into very small pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil a full kettle


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped potato and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then once fragrant, add your soy sauce and vegetable stock mix to the pan with 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potato is fork-tender


### Step 5

While the soup is cooking, combine a generous knob of butter in a bowl with the remaining chopped garlic and dried oregano

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together – this is your garlic butter


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Spread the garlic butter over the ciabatta halves and add half the buttered ciabatta to one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Tear the remaining buttered ciabatta into bite-sized pieces and add to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-7 min or until golden and crusty – this is your garlic bread and croutons


### Step 7

Once the potato is fork-tender, remove the pot from the heat<span class="text-danger"> </span>and add a splash of milk

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mushroom soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom soup in a bowl with the garlic bread to the side

Drizzle the soup with olive oil and season generously with black pepper

Top with the croutons

Enjoy!
