## Description

This simple French flouring technique for cooking fish is somewhat brilliant, giving it a golden crust and perfectly steamed insides. We've served it simply with some potatoes and spring greens, so you can mop up the lovely creamy dill sauce.

### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skin on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender

### Step 2

Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up & slice into thin strips

Tear the chestnut mushrooms into bite-sized pieces (this saves time and creates an interesting texture)

Chop the dill

### Step 3

Combine 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour with a pinch of salt and pepper on a large plate

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the floured basa fillets and cook for 3 min on each side

Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and set aside until serving

Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once the potatoes are tender, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 2-3 min further

Drain the potatoes & spring greens, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper

### Step 7

Once the mushrooms are crisped, add the white wine vinegar, clotted cream and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> milk to the pan

Crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> vegetable stock cube and cook for 2 min or until the sauce is slightly thickened

Enjoy!
