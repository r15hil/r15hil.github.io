## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once the pan is hot, drain your king prawns and add them to the pan with your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the halved green beans and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the beans are starting to soften and the prawns are cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your peanut butter, sriracha, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey, rice vinegar and soy sauce to a bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy peanut sauce


### Step 6

Once the prawns are cooked through, add the spicy peanut sauce and drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy peanut king prawn noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry


### Step 7

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

### Step 8

Serve the spicy peanut king prawn noodles and garnish with the crushed peanuts and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
