### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into small bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), dried oregano and the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) to a plate with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up – this is your spice paste

Add the chicken breast portion[s] to the plate and turn several times until fully coated in the spice paste

### Step 3

Add the chopped sweet potato to one side of a baking tray, then drizzle with 1/2 tbsp [3/4 tbsp] [1 tbsp] vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

Add the coated chicken to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 2 min

### Step 5

Meanwhile, roughly chop your green beans

Once the bulgur has had 2 min, add the chopped green beans and blanched edamame beans to the pot and cook for a further 5-7 min or until everything is cooked through and tender

Once tender, drain and return to the pot

Meanwhile, add your pine nut & seed mix to the tray with the chicken and sweet potato and cook for a further 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

### Step 6

Whilst everything is cooking, peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Combine your natural yoghurt with the juice of the remaining lemon, grated garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Use half!) and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your yoghurt dressing

### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad and roasted sweet potato to the drained bulgur and veg, then give everything a good mix up – this is your bulgur salad

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken over the bulgur salad

Drizzle the yoghurt dressing all over and sprinkle with your toasted pine nut & seed mix

Enjoy!
