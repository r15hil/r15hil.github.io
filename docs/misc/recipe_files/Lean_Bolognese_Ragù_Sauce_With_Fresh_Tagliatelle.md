## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the beef is browning, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dice your tomato[es] roughly

Once starting to brown, add the sliced garlic and diced tomato to the beef and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 2-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

While the pasta is cooking, add your dried basil and dried oregano to the beef with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Add your tomato paste, beef stock mix, soy sauce and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>of the reserved starchy pasta water and cook for 4-6 min or until thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lean bolognese ragù


### Step 7

Add the drained tagliatelle to the bolognese ragù and give everything a gentle mix up

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the lean bolognese ragù with fresh tagliatelle topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
