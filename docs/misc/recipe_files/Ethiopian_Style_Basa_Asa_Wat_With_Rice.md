## Ingredients

- 0 tomato paste
- 0 basa fillet
- 0 white long grain rice
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 courgette
- 1 tbsp berbere seasoning
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 130g white long grain rice
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 green chilli
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and starting to brown


### Step 4

Once softened, add your tomato paste and ground turmeric to the pan with the chopped garlic and berbere seasoning and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and your vegetable stock mix with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add the chopped basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your basa asa wat

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

### Step 8

Serve the basa asa wat with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
