## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the chopped pepper to the pan[s]

Cook for a further 6-7 min or until the pepper is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

While the chicken and pepper is cooking, add your rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain the noodles and set aside

Once cooked with a slight bite, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 4

Combine your cornflour with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and mix until well combined

Add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar with your soy sauce, tamarind paste and fish sauce

Add your ketjap manis and the juice of half your lime[s] (save the rest for a garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your pad Thai sauce


### Step 5

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into thirds

Finely chop your roasted peanuts

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked through, reduce the heat to medium

Push the chicken and pepper to one side of the pan[s] and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the chicken and pepper


### Step 7

Add the pad Thai sauce to the pan[s] with the chopped garlic and chopped spring onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked noodles

Cook for a final 1 min and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken breast pad Thai

### Step 8

Serve the chicken breast pad Thai and top with the chopped peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
