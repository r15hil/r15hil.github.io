## Description

Yasai translates to 'vegetable' in Japanese. Here our said vegetables are aubergine and sweet potato, which sit in a curry sauce enhanced by mango chutney and nigella seeds. Served with plain basmati rice and a fresh pickled ginger, baby leaf and peanut salad to cut through all that richness and give it a crunch!
