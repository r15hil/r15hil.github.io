Chop your roasted peanuts roughly

### Step 2

Add your beef mince to a bowl with half the chopped garlic and half the ginger (save the rest for later!) and your beef stock mix

Mix thoroughly until fully combined

### Step 3

Divide the beef mixture into 3 per person, roll into meatballs and flatten them slightly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 5 min on each side or until nicely browned

### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the remaining chopped garlic and remaining chopped ginger in a bowl with your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Vietnamese-style dressing

### Step 5

Boil a full kettle

Once the meatballs are browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add the sliced carrot to the pan and cook, covered, for 6 min or until starting to soften and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once soft, add your sugar snap peas and cook, uncovered, for 1 min further

### Step 6

Add your rice noodles to a pot of boiled water and cook for 4-5 min or until softened, stirring frequently with a fork to separate the noodles

Once done, drain the rice noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water

### Step 7

Add the Vietnamese-style dressing to the pan along with the drained noodles and a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water

Mix well until everything is nicely coated in the dressing – these are your Vietnamese-style chilli beef meatball noodles

### Step 8

Serve the Vietnamese-style chilli beef meatball noodles in a bowl garnished with the chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
