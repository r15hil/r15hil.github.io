## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 red chilli
- 2 cheese flavour slices
- 8ml sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 45g free-from mayonnaise
- 15ml soy sauce
- 4 white potatoes
- 15g pomegranate molasses
- 320g chestnut mushrooms
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> red onion

Chop the remaining onion into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>wedges

Separate the red onion wedges into petals


### Step 2

Tear the chestnut mushrooms into small pieces (clean hands is the best way!)

Add the torn mushrooms and red onion petals to a large bowl with the smoked paprika, soy sauce and pomegranate molasses

Add a generous pinch of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil, gently mix it all together set aside to marinate – this is your marinated veg


### Step 3

While the veg is marinating, cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 4

Add the marinated veg to a large baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the mushrooms have started to crisp – this is your shredded mushroom doner


### Step 5

Meanwhile, finely slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

Add the chilli rounds to a small bowl with the white wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar and set aside – these are your pickled chillies

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), sriracha, mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your chilli garlic mayo


### Step 6

Wash the little gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Shred the lettuce finely and add it to a bowl with the sliced red onion, a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your lettuce salad


### Step 7

Once the chips are done, push them into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> piles on the baking tray

Top each pile with the shredded mushroom doner, tear over the cheese flavour slices and return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your shredded mushroom doner loaded fries

### Step 8

Serve the shredded mushroom doner loaded fries with the lettuce salad to the side

Drizzle over the garlic chilli mayo and top with the pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
