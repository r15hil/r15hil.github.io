### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks, then chop the coriander stalks and leaves finely, keeping them separate

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped coriander stalks and outer lemongrass layers and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the outer lemongrass layers and discard

Transfer the oil to a bowl and set aside (reserve the pan!) – this is your coriander & lemongrass oil

Once done, drain the soaked noodles

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil
