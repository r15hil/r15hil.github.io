## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 250g turkey mince
- 30ml Chinese rice wine
-  30ml soy sauce 
- 40g hoisin sauce
- 1 pepper
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and roughly dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the turkey mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

While the turkey mince is browning, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>black pepper to the pan (freshly ground is best!)


### Step 6

Once the mince has browned, add the chopped pepper, garlic and ginger and cook for 2 min further

Add the Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened and sticky – this is your Chinese-style turkey & pepper stir-fry


### Step 7

Finely slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style turkey & pepper stir-fry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
