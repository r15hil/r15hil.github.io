### Step 1

Preheat the grill to a medium-high heat


Boil a kettle


### Step 2

Pat the fish dry with kitchen towel and place the fillets on a baking tray


Combine the miso and half of the mirin together to form a paste


Spread the paste evenly over each fish fillet and set them aside


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Bash the lemongrass&nbsp;with a rolling pin, cut&nbsp;down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely


Slice the mangetout diagonally


### Step 4

Heat a large pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the ginger, chopped lemongrass, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly

Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


&nbsp;

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed
