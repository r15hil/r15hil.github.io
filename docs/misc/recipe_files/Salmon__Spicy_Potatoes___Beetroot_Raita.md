## Description

Curry spices aren't exclusive to... curries. Here, we've used them to coat crisp, oven-roast potatoes which partner perfectly with our supreme salmon. Served along with a cooling beetroot raita (a yoghurty side) and scattered with fresh mint.

## Ingredients

- 2 salmon fillets
- 4 Maris Piper potato
- 1 Greek-style yoghurt (150g)
- 10g mint
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 spring onion
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 garlic clove
- 250g cooked beetroot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ 475°F/ Gas 9

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray, drizzle with 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil and coat in the curry powder

Season generously with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the potatoes have started to crisp


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Strip the mint leaves from the stems and chop finely, discard the stems


### Step 4

Open the beetroot packaging and add approx. 2-3 tbsp beetroot juice to a large mixing bowl

Discard any remaining juice and finely dice the beetroot


### Step 5

Add the sliced spring onion, diced beetroot, Greek-style yoghurt, garlic and half of the mint (save the rest for garnish) to the beetroot juice with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous amount of salt and pepper

Mix well and set aside – this is your beetroot raita


### Step 6

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15-20 min, remove the tray from the oven and push them to one side


### Step 7

Add the salmon fillets to the other side of the tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!), drizzle with vegetable oil and season the skin generously with salt

Return the tray to the oven for a further 7 min or until the fish has cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Remove and discard the salmon skin (optional) and serve with the potatoes and beetroot raita to the side

Garnish with the nigella seeds and remaining mint

Enjoy!
