## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 320g British chicken thighs, skin on
- 
- 30g panko breadcrumbs 
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 1 carrot
- 1 star anise
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 150g spring greens
- 2 shallots
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Season the chicken thigh skins with salt

Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down and cook for 10 min

Once the chicken skin is crispy, transfer it to a plate, skin-side up, and reserve the pan for later


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and halve the shallots

Peel the garlic

Heat a pot over a low heat with 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk and a knob of butter

Add the halved shallots, garlic, star anise, bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and cook for 20 min or until fragrant

Tip: the milk only needs to simmer gently


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Cut the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) into rounds

Cut the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) into rounds

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes, parsnip and carrot to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add the crispy chicken to the tray, skin-side up, and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the vegetables are starting to brown and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 5

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> chicken stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Pour away most of the oil until you're left with approx. 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> and return the pan to a medium heat

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir for 30 secs

Stir in the chicken stock and Henderson's Relish and cook for 4-5 min or the gravy has thickened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, once the milk has infused, remove and discard the star anise, garlic, shallot and bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>

Add the clotted cream and panko breadcrumbs to the milk with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the breadcrumbs have soaked up most of the liquid – this is your bread sauce


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, transfer it to a plate and set aside to rest

Add the sliced spring greens to the tray and mix them through the vegetables

Return the tray to the oven for a further 3 min, or until the spring greens are wilted

Tip: keep an eye on the greens, as they can burn quickly!

### Step 8

Slice the crispy chicken thighs in half

Serve the crispy chicken over the gravy with the roasted vegetables and bread sauce to the side

Enjoy!
