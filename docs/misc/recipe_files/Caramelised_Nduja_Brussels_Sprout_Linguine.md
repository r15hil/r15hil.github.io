## Ingredients

-  'Nduja (40g)
- Brussels sprouts (100g)
- Linguine (100g) x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Cornish clotted cream (40g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then slice half finely

Cut the remaining Brussels sprouts in half, lengthways


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp [3 tbsp] [4 tbsp] olive oil – this is your dressing

Once the onion and garlic has softened, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up until the flour has dissolved, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later

Reserve the pan


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced Brussels sprouts and halved Brussels sprouts with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften and char


### Step 5

While the sprouts are cooking, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 6-7 min (this will finish cooking in the sauce later!)

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Return the drained linguine to the pot and boil a little water in a kettle


### Step 6

Once the sprouts have softened, add your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go until the water has evaporated

Once evaporated, add your honey to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until caramelised – these are your caramelised 'Nduja Brussels sprouts

Tip: Reduce the heat to medium if the sprouts look like they're burning!


### Step 7

While the sprouts are caramelising, return the drained linguine to a medium heat with the cooked onion & garlic, clotted cream and reserved starchy pasta water

Add half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and chicken stock mix and stir it all together for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened and the pasta is fully coated – this is your velvety linguine

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the velvety linguine in a bowl topped with the caramelised 'Nduja Brussels sprouts

Serve the salad in a separate bowl with the dressing drizzled over and the remaining grated Italian hard cheese sprinkled on top

Enjoy!
