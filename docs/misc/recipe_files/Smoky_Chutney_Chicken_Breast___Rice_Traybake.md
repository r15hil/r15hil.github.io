### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into thin wedges

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and slightly charred

Once softened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your charred onion

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your chicken breast portion[s] and mango chutney to a bowl with most of your ground smoked paprika (reserve the rest for garnish!), mayo and Henderson's Relish

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken

### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with your chicken stock mix, charred onion and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Make sure all the rice is completely covered by liquid

Top with the marinated chicken, then cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

### Step 6

After the initial 20 min, remove the dish with the rice from the oven and discard the foil

Drizzle a little olive oil over the chicken and return the dish to the oven for a further 7-10 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your smoky chutney chicken breast & rice traybake

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1699372396427-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine the carrot ribbons and shredded lettuce in a large bowl with your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up - this is your carrot salad

### Step 8

Serve the smoky chutney chicken breast & rice traybake with the carrot salad to the side

Garnish with the reserved ground smoked paprika

Enjoy!
