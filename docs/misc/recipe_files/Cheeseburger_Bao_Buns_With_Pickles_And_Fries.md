## Description

This cheesy fusion is un-bao-lievable. For a double dose of flavour, you’ll top mince with melty cheese before loading it into fluffy bao buns. Pair with homemade pickles, fries and a drizzle of tangy burger sauce. Oh bao, that’s good.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, slice your cucumber finely into rounds

Add the cucumber rounds to a bowl with your cider vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water and a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix it all together and set aside – these are your quick-pickles


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s] into rings

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your mustard ketchup, mayo and tomato ketchup in a bowl with 1/2 tsp per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>of your pickling liquid from the bowl of pickles

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your burger sauce


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the chopped garlic and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat) and slightly crisp


### Step 6

Once cooked through and slightly crisp, gently push the cooked mince into the centre of pan

Top the mince with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for a final 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy beef

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min


### Step 7

To build, load each bao bun with a little shredded lettuce, a tomato round, shallot rings and some of the quick-pickles

Top with the cheesy beef and drizzle over a spoonful of the burger sauce – these are your cheeseburger bao buns

### Step 8

Serve the cheeseburger bao buns with the fries and any remaining shredded lettuce, quick-pickles and burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!
