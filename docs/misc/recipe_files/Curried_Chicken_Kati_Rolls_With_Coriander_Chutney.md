### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Cut your lemon[s] in half, then cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 2

Add the chopped coriander, chopped garlic, and chopped ginger to a pestle & mortar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and grind to a paste

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of half your lemon[s], a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and mix to combine

Stir through the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy coriander chutney

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until softened

### Step 5

Whilst the vegetables are softening, dice your tomato[es] finely

Top, tail, peel, then grate your carrot[s]

Chop your chicken breast strips in half

### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, add your tomato paste with half your garam masala and half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [170ml]</span> cold water, the juice of the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt then cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and begins to coat the vegetables

Once done, remove the pan from the heat – these are your curried vegetables

### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the halved chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and the remaining garam masala and remaining ground turmeric and cook for 10-12 min, turning once halfway, until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill the warmed tortillas with the curried vegetables, grated carrot, golden chicken and diced tomato

Drizzle over the spicy coriander chutney

Enjoy!
