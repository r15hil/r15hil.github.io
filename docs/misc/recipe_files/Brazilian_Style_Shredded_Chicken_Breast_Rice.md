### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] in half

Cut half the onion into wedges

Finely dice the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Transfer the browned chicken to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and reserve the pan

Boil a full kettle

### Step 3

Add the onion wedges and cherry tomatoes to the other side of the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-14 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Meanwhile, combine your beef stock mix and soy sauce with 750ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice, chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further, stirring to coat the grains

Add the beef stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked with a slight bite – this is your spiced rice

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the shredded chicken, spinach, roasted onion wedges and cherry tomatoes to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add a knob of butter and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Brazilian-style shredded chicken breast rice

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style shredded chicken breast rice topped with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
