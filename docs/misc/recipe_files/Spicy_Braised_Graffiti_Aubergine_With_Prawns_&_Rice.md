### Step 3

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 7

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan with the rice vinegar and cook, covered, for a final 1-2 min or until the spinach has wilted and the prawns are cooked through â€“ this is your spicy braised aubergine with prawns

### Step 8

Serve the spicy braised aubergine with prawns over the cooked rice

Sprinkle the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) all over

Enjoy!
