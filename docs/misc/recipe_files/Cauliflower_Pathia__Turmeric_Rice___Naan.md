## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste 
- 2 mini garlic & coriander naans
- 100g basmati rice
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 15g tamarind paste
- 1 cauliflower
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 3 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, garlic and ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once the pan is hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a pot (with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until sizzling

Once the cumin seeds start to sizzle, carefully add the basmati rice and stir it all together


### Step 3

Add the ground turmeric and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your turmeric rice

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, chop the cauliflower into small florets


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the ground cumin, curry powder and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the tomato paste and stir it all together

Tip: Add a little more vegetable oil if the pan's looking a little dry


### Step 6

Add the tamarind paste with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>boiled water and 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up, then add the cauliflower florets and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the cauliflower is tender – this is your cauliflower pathia


### Step 7

When the cauliflower is almost cooked, add the mini garlic & coriander naans to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the naans are hot

Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly

### Step 8

Serve the cauliflower pathia with the turmeric rice and warmed naans to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
