### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Drain the sweetcorn

### Step 2

Heat a large pot, with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped potato to the pot with most of the drained sweetcorn (save some for a garnish!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 6-8 min or until the vegetables are beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

### Step 4

Once the vegetables are softened, add the ginger & garlic paste and curry powder to the pot and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Combine the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix with 500ml <span class="text-danger">[950ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> crab meat (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potato is fork-tender

Once the potato is fork-tender, blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your curried sweetcorn soup

### Step 6

Meanwhile, line a baking tray with baking paper, then slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> thin slices, and add to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 6 min

Combine the mayo and the remaining crab meat in a bowl with half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper – this is your creamy crab mix

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1678300711641-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After an initial 6 min, remove the tray from the oven and top the ciabatta slices with the creamy crab mix

Return the tray to the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the ciabatta is golden – these are your chilli crab crostinis

### Step 8

Serve the curried sweetcorn soup in bowls with the chilli crab crostinis to the side

Garnish the chilli crab crostinis with the sliced spring onion

Top the soup with the reserved sweetcorn and the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
