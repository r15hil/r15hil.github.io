## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 1 tomato
- 1 ciabatta
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 1 avocado
- 80g spinach
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Tear the ciabatta into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the torn ciabatta to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until golden and crisp – these are your croutons


### Step 3

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly


### Step 4

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges

Chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

Peel and finely slice the garlic


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions and most of the sliced garlic (save some for later!) and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid, then cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Add half of the diced avocado (you'll use the rest later!), most of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) and the reserved sliced garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a food processor

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your avo dressing


### Step 7

Wash the spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to a large bowl with the tomato wedges, remaining diced avocado and croutons, season with a pinch of salt and a little drizzle of olive oil

Give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice finely

Serve the sliced chicken over the salad and drizzle the avo dressing all over

Garnish with a grind of black pepper, the remaining basil and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
