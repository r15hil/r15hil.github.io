## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0

- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg, then fill a bowl with very cold water, add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside, reserve the pot


### Step 2

Reboil a full kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into bite-sized pieces

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add the chopped potato and chopped carrot to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry and cool

Reboil a full kettle


### Step 4

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Slice your cucumber into discs

Add the cucumber discs to a bowl with your cider vinegar, chopped dill, a pinch of salt and sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 5

Combine the chopped parsley with your panko breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – these are your parsley breadcrumbs

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over the parsley breadcrumbs then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your herb-crusted basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Transfer the cooked potato & carrot to a bowl with the refreshed peas and sliced shallot

Add your mayo with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Russian-style potato salad


### Step 7

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut into 3 pieces per person

### Step 8

Serve the herb-crusted basa with the Russian-style potato salad and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Top the potato salad with the sliced egg

Enjoy!
