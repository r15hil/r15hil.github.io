### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove the outer leaves from the lettuce and set aside, then roughly shred the inner core

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

### Step 4

Once the pork mince has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, roughly tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan

Add your hoisin sauce and soy sauce and cook for 3-4 min further until everything is combined, the mushrooms have started to soften and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Once the mushrooms have softened, stir through the shredded lettuce and toasted sesame seeds  – this is your hoisin pork & mushrooms

### Step 8

Add the lettuce leaves to the side of your bowl and top with your brown rice and hoisin pork & mushrooms

Garnish with your crispy onions and chilli rounds (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Tip: Make loaded lettuce cups by adding filling to the lettuce leaves!

Enjoy!
