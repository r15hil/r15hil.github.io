## Ingredients

- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 courgette
- 100g Greek feta cheese
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 130g quinoa
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 honey pot (25g)
- 125g seasonal radishes
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 50g baby kale
- 1 bag of hazelnuts (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Chop the radishes in half

Cut a large sheet of tin foil approx. the size of a sheet of A3 paper

Lay the chopped radishes, Tenderstem broccoli and feta cheese in the middle of the tin foil and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 parcels and use 2 trays!


### Step 2

Add the oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey and balsamic vinegar to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and pepper

Whisk it together with a fork – this is your honey balsamic marinade


### Step 3

Drizzle the honey balsamic marinade all over the feta, radishes and Tenderstem

Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together to form a sealed parcel

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until everything is cooked and tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered


### Step 5

Top, tail then peel lengths off the courgette until you end up with a pile of courgette 'ribbons'

Wash the baby kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the quinoa is cooked, add the quinoa and courgette ribbons to a large bowl with the baby kale and add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a gentle mix up (clean hands is the best way!)


### Step 6

After the vegetables and feta have had 25 min, add the hazelnuts to the tray for the final 5 min, until roasted


### Step 7

Roughly chop the roasted hazelnuts

### Step 8

Serve the radishes & Tenderstem over the quinoa, courgette and baby kale

Divide the baked feta between the plates

Drizzle over all the remaining honey balsamic marinade from the tin foil parcel

Garnish with the chopped roasted hazelnuts

Enjoy!
