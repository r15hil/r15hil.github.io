## Ingredients

- 70g quinoa
- 1 whole butternut squash
- 1 cider vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 onion marmalade pot (40g)
- 4 Cumberland sausages
- 5g coriander
- 1 bag of hazelnuts (25g)
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 1 spring onion
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Peel the butternut squash and cut in half using a sharp knife

Tip: Drizzle the knife with a little vegetable oil for easier chopping

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard

Slice finely into half-moons


### Step 2

Cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Add the sliced butternut squash to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the ground coriander to the squash with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Add the onion wedges and sausages to the tray, spreading them out evenly

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until everything's cooked through and tender

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving


### Step 5

Whilst the quinoa is cooking, slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely on the diagonal

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish)

Combine the onion marmalade, cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your onion marmalade dressing


### Step 6

Heat a small, dry pan over a medium heat

Crush the hazelnuts roughly in the bag with a rolling pin

Once hot, add the hazelnuts to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and fragrant

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so you don't burn them!


### Step 7

Add the sliced spring onion, chopped coriander and lamb's lettuce to the cooked quinoa

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together – this is your quinoa & lamb's lettuce salad

Slice the cooked sausages in half on the diagonal

### Step 8

Serve the roasted squash and sliced sausage over the quinoa & lamb's lettuce salad

Break the roasted red onion into petals over the top, then garnish with the toasted hazelnuts and coriander leaves

Drizzle over the onion marmalade dressing all over

Enjoy!
