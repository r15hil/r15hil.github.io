Add the juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and mix to form a paste – this is your peri peri paste

Cut the warmed pittas in half and spread a dollop of natural yoghurt inside each,  then stuff with the peri peri mushrooms, caramelised onions, shredded lettuce and tomato rounds – these are your peri peri mushroom pittas

Serve the peri peri mushroom pittas with the sweet potato wedges and any remaining shredded lettuce and tomato rounds to the side
