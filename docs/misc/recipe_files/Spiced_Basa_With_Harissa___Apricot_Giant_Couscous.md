## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Red onion
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Ras el hanout (1tbsp)
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Harissa paste (40g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Harissa paste (20g) x0
- Garlic clove
- Giant couscous (130g)
- Diced apricots (30g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, set aside and reserve the pan


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Wash your spinach

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, set aside and reserve the pan


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, add your giant couscous and diced apricots to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the giant couscous for 8-10 min or until tender with a slight bite and once done, drain the giant couscous over the spinach and return both to the pot

Meanwhile, combine your ras el hanout with a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your spice mix


### Step 4

Add your basa fillets to the spice mix and turn them several times until they're fully coated in all the spices – this is your coated basa

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Combine the juice of half your lemon[s] in a bowl with your  harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped garlic

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your harissa dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


### Step 7

Add the caramelised onion and most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish!) to the drained couscous and spinach and give everything a good mix up

Stir through the harissa dressing – this is your harissa & apricot giant couscous

### Step 8

Serve the spiced basa over the harissa & apricot giant couscous

Top with the toasted almonds and remaining chopped herbs

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
