- British pork loin steak (150g) x0
- Apple
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a  pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel, core and roughly chop your apple[s]

Add the chopped apple to a separate pot with a lid with 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [125ml] </span>cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook, covered, over a medium heat for 10-12 min or until the apple has softened, stirring occasionally

Once done, transfer the softened apple to a bowl with a knob of butter and mash until smooth – this is your apple sauce


### Step 3

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] finely on the diagonal

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped parsley and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Give it a good mix up – this is your herby crumb

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 4

Once done, drain the potatoes (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges

Add the fluffed potatoes to a large baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 5

Once the potatoes have had 10 min, add the sliced carrots and halved green beans to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10 min

Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Reboil a kettle


### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter

Once melted, add 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span>[4 tsp]</span> flour with the crushed garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water with your chicken stock mix and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened, then set aside for later – this is your garlic-infused gravy


### Step 7

While the gravy is thickening, top your pork loin steak[s] with the herby crumb

Tip: Press the crumb into the pork steaks firmly with your hands to help it stick!

Once the veg has had 10 min, add the herb-crusted pork steak[s] to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 13-15 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 8

Return the garlic-infused gravy to the hob to reheat

Serve the herb-crusted roast pork with the roast potatoes, carrots and green beans to the side

Serve with a dollop of apple sauce and pour the garlic-infused gravy all over

Enjoy!
