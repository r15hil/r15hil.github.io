### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Add your diced chicken breast to a bowl with most of your cornflour (save 1/2 tsp per person for later!) and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the coated chicken along with half of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and cook for 5 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Once the chicken is crisp, add the chopped pepper and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 3 min further until the pepper has started to soften

### Step 5

Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 6

Add the juice of half your orange[s] (save the rest for later!) to a bowl along with your rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce and remaining cornflour

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix until fully combined – this is your orange sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1585748371596-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the pepper has softened, reduce the heat to medium

Add the orange sauce to the pan and cook for 2 min until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky orange chicken

Tip: If the sauce looks a little thick, add a splash of water!

Meanwhile, peel and slice the remaining orange into triangles

### Step 8

Serve the sticky orange chicken over the cooked rice

Top with the orange triangles

Enjoy!
