### Step 1

Peel your red onion[s] and finely slice 3 rings per person, then dice the remaining onion

Add the onion rings and your red wine vinegar to a shallow bowl and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled onion rings

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened

### Step 3

Chop your parsley as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and the chopped parsley in a bowl – this is your herby mayo

### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and beef mince to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce, then cook for a further 9-10 min or until the beef mince is cooked (no pink meat!) and starting to crisp – this is your smoky beef mince

### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper, then separate the outer leaves and finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain and finely dice your pineapple slices (don’t chuck the pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies or marinades!)

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 7

Drain the quick-pickled onion rings and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Top the warmed tortillas with a dollop of herby mayo and the lettuce leaves

Spoon over the smoky beef mince, top with the pineapple salsa and garnish with the quick-pickled onion rings – these are your smoky beef, pineapple & red onion tacos

Enjoy!
