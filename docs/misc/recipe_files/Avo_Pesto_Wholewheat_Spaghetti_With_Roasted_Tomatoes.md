## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add your cherry tomatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until cooked and starting to burst


### Step 2

While the tomatoes are cooking, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 3

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Roughly chop your basil, including the stalks

Cut your lemon[s] into quarters


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!), vegetable stock mix and smashed avocado to a food processor

Squeeze in the juice of 1/4 of your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!)

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your creamy avo pesto


### Step 5

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the dressing and give it a gentle mix up – this is your dressed salad


### Step 6

Once the tomatoes are almost done, add your pumpkin seeds to one half of the tray and return the tray to the oven for a further 2-3 min until toasted

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 7

Add the drained spaghetti to the pot with the creamy avo pesto and give it a good mix up until the spaghetti is fully coated in the pesto

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry!

Once everything is mixed together, add the roasted cherry tomatoes and stir them through gently – this is your creamy avo pesto spaghetti with roasted tomatoes

### Step 8

Serve the creamy avo pesto spaghetti with roasted tomatoes with the dressed salad to the side

Top with the toasted pumpkin seeds and remaining chopped basil

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedge[s]

Enjoy!
