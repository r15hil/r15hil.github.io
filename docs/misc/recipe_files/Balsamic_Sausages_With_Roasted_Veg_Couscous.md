Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until the sausages are golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is starting to brown

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

### Step 5

Add your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-high heat

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for approx. 2-3 min or until it turns into a runny glaze that coats the back of a spoon

Tip: Watch the pan like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and set aside until serving – this is your balsamic glaze

Chop the roasted pepper into small pieces

Drizzle generously with olive oil and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

### Step 8

Serve the cooked sausages over the roasted veg couscous

Spoon the balsamic glaze all over the sausages

Enjoy!
