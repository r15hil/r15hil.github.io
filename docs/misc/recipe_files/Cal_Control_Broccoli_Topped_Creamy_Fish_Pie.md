- Basa fillet x0
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Lighter cheese (30g) x2
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- White potato x2
- Shallot
- Broccoli
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your broccoli into small florets, and cut the stem[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped broccoli and potato to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until everything's tender and cooked through, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your lighter cheese finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water and add 2/3 of your soft cheese (save the rest for later!) and whisk until smooth – this is your creamy stock

Chop your basa fillet[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter

Once melted, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until the shallot is well coated


### Step 4

Add the creamy stock to the pan with the chopped basa, a squeeze of lemon juice (save the rest for later!) and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your fish pie filling

Transfer the fish pie filling an oven-proof dish


### Step 5

Add the chopped lighter cheese and remaining soft cheese to the drained broccoli & potato with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your broccoli mash

Top the fish pie filling with the broccoli mash and smooth gently with a fork to cover the filling evenly

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and slightly golden on top and the basa is cooked though – this is your broccoli-topped creamy fish pie

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Whilst the pie is cooking, trim your green beans

Add your green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a large splash of cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into wedges

Once the green beans are cooked, add a squeeze of lemon juice with a pinch of salt and pepper and toss together – these are your lemony beans

### Step 8

Serve the broccoli-topped creamy fish pie with the lemony beans to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
