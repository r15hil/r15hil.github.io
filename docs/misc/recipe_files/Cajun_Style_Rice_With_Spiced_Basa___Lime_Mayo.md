## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Drain and rinse your black beans

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut your lime[s] into wedges

Add your mayo to a bowl with a small squeeze of lime juice, a small drizzle of olive oil and plenty of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lime mayo


### Step 5

Add your ground smoked paprika to a large bowl with your ground coriander, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried thyme

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your Cajun-style spice mix

Chop your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces and pat dry


### Step 6

Once the onion and pepper have softened, add the drained black beans to the pan with half the Cajun-style spice mix (you'll use the rest later!), the chopped garlic and vegetable stock mix

Mix it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then transfer to the pot with the cooked rice

Give everything a good mix up, then cover and set aside (reserve the pan!) – this is your Cajun-style rice


### Step 7

Add the chopped basa pieces to the bowl with the remaining Cajun-style spice mix, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – these are your spiced basa pieces

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the spiced basa pieces and cook for 3-4 min each side, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Cajun-style rice  topped with the spiced basa pieces and drizzle over the lime mayo

Garnish with the lime wedges and season with black pepper

Enjoy!
