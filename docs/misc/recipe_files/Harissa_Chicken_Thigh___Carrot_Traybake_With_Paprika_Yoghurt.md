### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Top, tail, and slice your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into chunky discs on the diagonal

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into thin wedges

### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes, chopped carrot and onion wedges to a large tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-17 min or until the potatoes are starting to soften

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add most of your ground smoked paprika (save some for later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a generous drizzle of olive oil and half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to a medium bowl

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinade

### Step 5

Once the potatoes have slightly softened, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your chicken thighs, drizzle the marinade over the chicken then return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven and cook for a further 12-14 min or until almost cooked (reserve the bowl)

Remove the tray[s] from the oven, spread your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over the chicken and return to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa chicken thigh & carrot traybake

While the chicken is cooking, wipe the reserved bowl clean with kitchen paper

Combine your natural yoghurt with the remaining ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt in the reserved bowl

Stir it all together – this is your paprika yoghurt

### Step 7

Serve the harissa chicken thigh & carrot traybake with the salad to the side and drizzle over the paprika yoghurt

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and the remaining cider vinegar and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!
