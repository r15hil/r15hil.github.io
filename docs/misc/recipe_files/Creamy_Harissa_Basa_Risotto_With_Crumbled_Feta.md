## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste
- 0 tomato paste
- 160g arborio rice
- 0 basa fillet
- 50g soft cheese
- 0 baharat
- 1 tsp ground sumac
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 1 tbsp baharat
- 0 harissa paste
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 30g feta
- 40g harissa paste
- 80g spinach
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml<span class="text-purple"> [975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add the chopped garlic, tomato paste and your baharat to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add most of the vegetable stock (you'll use the rest later!) a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for an initial 25 min or until the rice is almost cooked


### Step 5

While the risotto is cooking, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Crumble your feta


### Step 6

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and chop into bite-sized pieces

After the initial 25 min, add the spinach and chopped basa to the risotto with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Pour in the remaining vegetable stock and cook for a final 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through and all of the stock is absorbed

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the basa is cooked through, add your soft cheese and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the risotto with half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and mix it all together â€“ this is your creamy harissa basa risotto

### Step 8

Serve the creamy harissa basa risotto in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining ground sumac and the crumbled feta

Drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
