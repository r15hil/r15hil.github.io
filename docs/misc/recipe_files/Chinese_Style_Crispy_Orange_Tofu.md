- White basmati rice (130g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the air fryer to 200°C

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Chop your orange[s] in half

Cut your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem and leaves


### Step 3

Add a splash of cold water to the base of the air fryer (this will help steam the vegetables!)

Add the broccoli florets and onion petals to the air fryer basket with a generous spray of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min, shaking the basket occasionally, or until the veg is slightly charred and cooked through, then set aside for later


### Step 4

While the broccoli and onion are cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the drained tofu into large bite-sized pieces

Add the tofu pieces to a large bowl with half your soy sauce and 3/4 of your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu


### Step 5

Add the coated tofu to the air fryer basket with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and cook for 5-6 min, shaking the basket occasionally, or until golden and crispy

While the tofu is cooking, combine the the juice of your orange[s] in a small bowl with the remaining soy sauce and your toasted sesame oil

Add the remaining cornflour, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>cold water and mix until fully combined – this is your orange sauce


### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant add the orange sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened


### Step 7

Once slightly thickened, add the charred broccoli & onion, crispy tofu and your toasted sesame seeds and stir it all together – this is your air fryer Chinese-style crispy orange tofu

### Step 8

Serve the air fryer Chinese-style crispy orange tofu over the basmati rice

Enjoy!
