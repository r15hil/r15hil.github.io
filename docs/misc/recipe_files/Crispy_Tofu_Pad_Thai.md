- British free range egg

- Soy sauce (30ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper, then tear into bite-sized pieces and combine in a bowl with half your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!), your umami seasoning and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coated tofu

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan (reserve the bowl) and cook for 10-12 min or until golden – this is your crispy tofu


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Combine the remaining cornflour with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water in the reserved bowl and mix until well combined

Add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar with your soy sauce, tamarind paste, ketjap manis and the juice of half your lime[s] (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your pad Thai sauce


### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips

Once the tofu is crispy, transfer the crispy tofu to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper to the pan

Cook for a further 5-6 min or until the pepper is tender


### Step 4

While the pepper is cooking, add your rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 5

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into thirds

Finely chop your roasted peanuts

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Once the pepper is tender, reduce the heat to medium

Push the pepper to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the pepper


### Step 7

Add the pad Thai sauce to the pan with the chopped garlic and chopped spring onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked noodles and crispy tofu

Cook for a final 1 min and give everything a good mix up – this is your crispy tofu pad Thai

### Step 8

Serve the crispy tofu pad Thai and top with the chopped peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
