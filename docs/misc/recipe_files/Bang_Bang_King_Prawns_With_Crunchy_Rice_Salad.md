### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail, peel, then grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add the salad, grated carrot and sliced spring onion to a large mixing bowl

### Step 3

Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Cut half of your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds (save the rest for later!)

Add the cucumber matchsticks and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with the salad, carrot and spring onion – this is your crunchy salad

### Step 5

Combine your peanut butter and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl and mix well until you have a smooth paste

Add your soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix well to combine – this is your peanut dressing

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan

Sprinkle your five-spice mix over the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your bang bang king prawns

### Step 7

Meanwhile, fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to the crunchy salad – this is your crunchy rice salad

Toss the crunchy rice salad in a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the bang bang king prawns over the crunchy rice salad and drizzle the peanut dressing all over

Garnish with a sprinkling of your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
