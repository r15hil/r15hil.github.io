## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 2 x 120g tilapia fillets
- 1 tomato
-  6 plain tortillas
- 80g spinach
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the tilapia fillets into bite-sized pieces

Add the tilapia pieces to a bowl with the curry powder, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up so that the fish is fully coated in the spices – this is your coated tilapia


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the sliced red onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Pick the mint leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discarding the stalks


### Step 4

Add the chopped coriander and mint to a pestle & mortar with a small squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt

Grind to a fine paste, then add the mayo and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your herby chutney

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely!


### Step 5

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with the nigella seeds, remaining sliced red onion and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high

Add the coated tilapia to the pan and cook for 2-3 min without stirring, then turn the fish and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon and mix to combine – this is your spiced tilapia

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, add the tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, then add the spinach

Return the pan to the heat, stir for 1 min or until the spinach is beginning to wilt very slightly, then remove from the heat

### Step 8

Serve the warmed tortillas topped with the wilted spinach, spiced tilapia and tomato salad

Drizzle with the herby chutney

Enjoy!
