### Step 1

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-18 min or until softened

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

### Step 4

Peel and chop your sweet potatoes into rough bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and bring to the boil

Cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Add half your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the cooked sweet potatoes and mash until smooth

### Step 6

Add your ground coriander and tomato paste to the softened onion and cook for 1 min

Add the chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock, drained lentils and remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your lentil filling

Meanwhile, chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

### Step 7

Once everything is cooked, add the roasted aubergine to the filling and give it a good mix up

Transfer the aubergine & lentil filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the mashed sweet potato

Crumble over your feta and put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your warming harissa aubergine & lentil pie

### Step 8

Remove the warming harissa aubergine & lentil pie from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min before serving

Serve the warming harissa aubergine & lentil pie garnished with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
