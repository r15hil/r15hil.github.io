### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Trim, then chop your red chilli[es] roughly

Tip: Deseed the chilli first if you're not a fan of spice!

### Step 2

Add your sriracha, the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger and garlic to a food processor with your rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Blitz until smooth – this is your speedy sambal

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, use a pestle and mortar!

### Step 3

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop finely on a diagonal until you are left with a pile of carrot strips

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the carrot strips and cook for 2 min

Add the chopped spring greens and cook for 1 min further, then add a very small splash of cold water and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

### Step 6

Once the vegetables are tender, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with 2/3 of the speedy sambal (save the rest for later!)

Add your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil and cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through

### Step 7

Drain the cooked noodles and add them to the pan with the prawns and vegetables

Gently stir everything together for 1-2 min or until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – this is your king prawn mie goreng

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn mie goreng with the remaining speedy sambal drizzled all over the top

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
