### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until roasted and golden – these are your roasted peppers

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water, then add your tomato paste, Chinese rice wine and red chilli relish – this is your sweet tomato stock

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min until softened but not browned

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice, chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min further

### Step 5

Add 1/3 of the sweet tomato stock and stir continuously until absorbed

Continue to add the remaining sweet tomato stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the roasted pepper from the oven

Stir half of the roasted pepper into the risotto (you'll use the rest later!)

Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in half of the grated cheese and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!), then season with a grind of black pepper – this is your sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto

### Step 8

To serve, top the sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto with the reserved roasted pepper, remaining grated cheese and the pine kernel & seed mix

Garnish with the reserved chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
