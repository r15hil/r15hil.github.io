## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half


### Step 2

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for an initial 10 min or until slightly tender


### Step 3

While the potatoes cook, add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg

Once done, drain and refill the pot with ice-cold water and the cooked egg[s], then set them aside to cool

Tip: Use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and grate your garlic and cut your lime[s] in half

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper, remove the outer leaves and set aside, shred the inner core[s]

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 5

Once the potatoes have cooked for 10 min, trim your green beans, then add to the pot and cook for a final 3-4 min or until tender

Once tender, drain and allow to cool slightly


### Step 6

Combine the juice of the lime[s] with your peanut butter in a small bowl with your ketjap manis, grated garlic (don’t like raw garlic? Just add a little!), red chilli relish and cultured coconut

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your gado gado dressing


### Step 7

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut into quarters

### Step 8

Serve the lettuce, carrot ribbons and sliced cucumber over the potatoes and beans with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Top with the quartered eggs – this is your Indonesian-style gado gado salad

Drizzle the gado gado dressing all over

Enjoy!
