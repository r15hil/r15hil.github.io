## Description

We've made a Sri Lankan classic: Crab Curry. While commonly a whole crab sits in a bowl, we've created a more manageable version with ready-picked crabmeat. The sweetness from the crab and creaminess from the coconut are paired with a zingy lime and cucumber salad and served over fluffy rice.

## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli 
- 150g fragrant basmati rice
- 1 flecked coconut cream sachet (50g)
- 100g Cornish fifty fifty crabmeat
- 1/2 cucumber 
- 1 tbsp home blend curry powder
- 1 tsp bright yellow turmeric
- 20g fresh coriander
- 3 shallots
- 1 tsp black nigella seeds
- 3 garlic cloves 
- 1 knob of fresh root ginger (15g)
- 1 lime 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the basmati&nbsp;rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>&nbsp;shallots&nbsp;(you'll use the rest later!)&nbsp;and all of the garlic&nbsp;


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon)


Cut the stalks off the coriander&nbsp;and set the leaves aside for later &nbsp;


Cut the stalk off of the red&nbsp;chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Boil a kettle


Add the shallot, garlic, ginger, coriander stalks, chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)&nbsp;and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;to a food processor and blitz the lot to a coarse paste&nbsp;


If you don't have a food processor, just chop everything together finely&nbsp;


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat


Add the curry powder&nbsp;and ground&nbsp;turmeric and cook for 1 min&nbsp;


Add the blended ingredients, with a large knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt&nbsp;


Cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant and softened


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Chop the hard&nbsp;coconut&nbsp;cream into pieces and combine it with 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water and whisk to dissolve - this is your coconut stock


Separate the white crabmeat from the brown crabmeat, you'll use the white meat later!


Add the coconut stock, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and the brown crabmeat to the pan and cook for 5 min or until it's reached a loose consistency


### Step 6

Meanwhile, halve the cucumber lengthways, scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon and discard, then finely slice the flesh


Chop the coriander leaves roughly


Peel and finely chop the remaining&nbsp;shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Halve the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 7

Mix the sliced&nbsp;cucumber, chopped&nbsp;coriander, chopped&nbsp;shallot and&nbsp;nigella seeds&nbsp;in a bowl&nbsp;


Squeeze&nbsp;the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the bowl and add and a pinch of salt - this is your cucumber salad

### Step 8

Serve the curry in bowls with the cooked rice and garnish with the white crabmeat


Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Serve the cucumber salad alongside


Enjoy!<br /><br />
