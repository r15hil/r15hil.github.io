### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a full kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and roughly chop half your brown onion[s], then slice the remaining onion finely

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

### Step 2

Add the roughly chopped onion and your red Thai curry paste to a food processor with your curry powder, ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> </span>vegetable oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blitz into a smooth paste – this is your khao soi-style curry paste

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl with a squeeze of lime and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 4

Add your medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soak for 5-6 min and then drain

Add 1/4 of the soaked noodles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy noodles

### Step 5

Heat a pot over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Once the chicken has started to brown, add the sliced onion and khao soi-style curry paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Once fragrant, add your chopped creamed coconut and chicken stock mix to the pot with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[500ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook for 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your coconut chicken breast khao soi

### Step 7

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then once hot, add your halved green beans and cook for 6-7 min or until tender

Once done, add the lime zest and some of the chopped coriander and give everything a good mix up – these are your zesty green beans

### Step 8

Add the drained noodles to a bowl and top with the coconut chicken breast khao soi

Top with the quick-pickled shallot and the crispy noodles

Garnish with a lime wedge and the remaining chopped coriander

Serve the zesty green beans to the side and enjoy!
