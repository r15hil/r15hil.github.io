## Ingredients

- 250g pak choi
- 2 salmon fillets
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 50g fresh chilli jam
- 150g basmati rice 
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 2 spring onions
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 15g root ginger
- 3 soy sauce sachets (24ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the rice, 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;water to a large pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the pak choi in half, separating the white and green parts


Cut the white part into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


Shred the green tops&nbsp;


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the white pak choi (keep the shredded green part for later) with a pinch of salt


Cook for 3-4 min or until starting to colour&nbsp;


Meanwhile, slice the spring onions finely, discarding the root ends


### Step 4

Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Once the rice is cooked, transfer the pak choi to the same pot, without stirring


Tip: if the rice needs a little longer, then just wait until it's finished cooking before adding the pak choi


Cover the cooked rice and pak choi with a lid&nbsp;to keep warm until serving&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Combine the ginger, chilli jam, rice vinegar and soy sauce with 50ml<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[100ml]</span>&nbsp;water&nbsp;


This is your sweet chilli sauce&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil


Pat the salmon dry with kitchen towel and season with salt on both sides


Add the salmon, skin-side-down and cook for 1 min&nbsp;<br /><br />


### Step 7

Add the sweet chilli sauce, cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min further until the salmon is cooked through (it will flake easily when cooked)


Meanwhile, stir the spring onion, remaining shredded green pak choi tops, toasted sesame oil and half the toasted sesame seeds into the rice and season with salt and pepper&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the sweet chilli salmon over the sesame pak choi rice, spooning any remaining sauce over the salmon


Garnish with the remaining sesame seeds


Enjoy!&nbsp;
