### Step 1

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger and garlic

Add the pork mince to a large bowl with 1/2 of the ginger, garlic and soy sauce (save the rest for later!)

Add the panko breadcrumbs and mix thoroughly until fully combined – this is your pork mixture

Divide the pork mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> and shape into small meatballs – these are your pork balls

### Step 2

Add 60g <span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour and the white wine vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt

Add 80ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>very cold water and mix thoroughly – this is your batter

### Step 3

Dip the pork balls in the batter (turn several times to coat completely)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with enough vegetable oil to just coat the bottom of the pan

Once hot, add the battered pork balls to the pan and cook for 8-10 min, turning regularly, until your pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the batter is crispy

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until most of the water has been absorbed and the rice is almost cooked

### Step 5

Add the cornflour to a bowl along with the juice from the canned pineapple

Add the tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, chilli jam and remaining soy sauce and mix until smooth – this is your sweet & sour sauce

Chop the pineapple roughly

### Step 6

Once the pork balls are cooked through and crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside

Carefully wipe any excess hot oil from the pan using kitchen paper

Return the pan to a medium heat, add the remaining ginger and garlic and cook for 1 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the sweet & sour sauce and chopped pineapple and cook for 2-3 min until thickened

### Step 7

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the sugar snap peas to the pot and cook for 2 min further

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your sugar snap rice

### Step 8

Serve the crispy pork balls over the sugar snap rice with the sweet & sour sauce to the side

Enjoy!
