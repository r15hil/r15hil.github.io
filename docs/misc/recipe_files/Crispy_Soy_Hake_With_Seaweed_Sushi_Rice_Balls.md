- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- Blanched edamame beans (160g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully, add to an oven-proof dish with 250ml [325ml] [500ml] boiled water, then cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked, then transfer the cooked rice to a plate and set aside for 10 min or until the rice is cooled


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away, then slice finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a small bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 3

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and the grated garlic (not a big fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) in a small bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar – this is your dipping sauce


### Step 4

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake to a large bowl with the remaining soy sauce, then set aside to marinate


### Step 5

Combine your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add your rinsed edamame beans to a bowl with half of the sriracha mayo (you'll use the rest later!) and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your edamame salad


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Add your cornflour to the marinated hake and give everything a good mix up until the hake is fully coated

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy soy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooled, roll into 3 balls per person – these are your sushi rice balls

Tip: Use wet hands to make it easier!

### Step 8

Serve the crispy soy hake with the sushi rice balls, edamame salad and quick-pickled cucumber (reserve the pickling liquid) to the side

Drizzle the remaining sriracha mayo over the rice balls and sprinkle over your shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and seaweed flakes, then combine the reserved pickling liquid and the dipping sauce and serve it to the side

Enjoy!
