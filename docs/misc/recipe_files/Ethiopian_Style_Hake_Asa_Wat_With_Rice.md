Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and starting to brown

### Step 4

Once softened, add your tomato paste and ground turmeric to the pan with the chopped garlic and berbere seasoning and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and your vegetable stock mix with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add the chopped hake to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily
