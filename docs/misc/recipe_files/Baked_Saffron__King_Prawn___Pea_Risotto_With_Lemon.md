## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 3

Crush your garlic clove[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Remove the skin and discard, then chop the garlic roughly

Add the chopped garlic, your arborio rice and saffron to the dish and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Stir in your vegetable stock mix and add 600ml <span class="text-purple">[780ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min or until most of the water has absorbed and the rice is almost cooked


### Step 5

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Drain your king prawns

After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the drained king prawns, blanched peas and a small splash of water

Stir it all up, cover with the lid and return the dish to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until the prawns are cooked through


### Step 6

Once done, add the juice of half<span class="text-danger"> </span>your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon, half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and a grind of black pepper then stir it all up – this is your oven-baked saffron, king prawn & pea risotto


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To serve, sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese all over the risotto and top with the salad

Garnish with the lemon wedges, drizzle with some olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Dig in!
