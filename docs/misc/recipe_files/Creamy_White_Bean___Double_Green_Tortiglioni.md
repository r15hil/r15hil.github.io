## Ingredients

- 185g canned cannellini beans
- 0 tortiglioni
- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 50g soft cheese
- 2 garlic cloves
- 30g pumpkin seeds
- 1 courgette
- 80g Tenderstem broccoli
- 80g spinach
- 0 pumpkin seeds
- 150g tortiglioni

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, transfer them to a small bowl, reserving the pan


### Step 2

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the drained cannellini beans and sliced garlic

Season with a generous pinch of salt and a crack of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix with your soft cheese in 180ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[280ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Add the sliced courgette to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will finish cooking in the sauce later!

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the courgette has started to brown, add the creamy stock, spinach and Tenderstem broccoli to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has begun to thicken


### Step 7

Add the cooked tortiglioni to the pan with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the Tenderstem is cooked with a slight bite – this is your creamy white bean & double green tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the creamy white bean & double green tortiglioni

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a very generous grind of black pepper

Top with the toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!
