## Ingredients

- 1 bag of blanched almonds
- 150g basmati rice 
- 150g organic Greek yoghurt
- 10g fresh coriander
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 aubergine 
- 1 onion
- 30g sultanas

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in half lengthways


Score the flesh quite deeply (in a diamond pattern), taking care not to cut through the skin


### Step 2

Peel and dice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> finely


Heat a medium-sized pot (with matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil on a medium heat


When hot, add the onion, curry powder, sultanas and a pinch of salt


Cook for 3 min or until the onion is softened


### Step 3

Add the basmati rice and stir briefly to coat the grains in the spices


Add 360ml <span class="text-danger">(750ml)</span> water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 20 min or until the water is absorbed


Check to prevent over-cooking and, once done, set aside until serving


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil to a baking tray


Add the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the garlic and a generous amount of salt and pepper straight onto the baking tray


Mix the oil, garlic and spice well with a spatula or spoon


### Step 5

Lay the aubergines cut-side down in the flavoured oil and move them around so they are coated completely


Once coated, turn them cut-side up


Put the tray in the oven for 15-25 min or until the aubergine is tender enough to pierce easily with a knife


Tip: Check them after 15 min and then check regularly


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut the cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out and discard the seeds with a teaspoon


Grate the cucumber into a mixing bowl&nbsp;


Add the yoghurt, remaining garlic, a big pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil


Mix to combine and set aside for serving - this is your raita


### Step 7

Add the almonds to a separate baking tray or dish


Put it in the oven for 3-5 min or until they've darkened slightly in colour, checking often to prevent burning


Once golden, remove and allow to cool before chopping coarsely&nbsp;


Chop the coriander, including the stalks, finely

### Step 8

Season the cooked rice generously with salt and pepper and stir through the coriander and almonds


Once the aubergines are tender, serve them over the rice with the raita on top


Scatter with the nigella seeds and enjoy!
