### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cook for 1-2 min further, stirring until the sauce sticks to the noodles – this is your simply delicious chicken stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!
