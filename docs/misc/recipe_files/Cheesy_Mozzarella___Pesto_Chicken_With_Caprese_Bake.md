### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add your balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the vegetables are soft and the potatoes are crisp – this is your caprese bake


### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)


### Step 6

Top the chicken with your traditional Italian pesto and torn mozzarella

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the cheese is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy mozzarella & pesto chicken


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are done, carefully cut off the root, then remove and discard the skins of your red onion

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy mozzarella & pesto chicken with the caprese bake to the side

Pour over any remaining chicken juices

Enjoy!
