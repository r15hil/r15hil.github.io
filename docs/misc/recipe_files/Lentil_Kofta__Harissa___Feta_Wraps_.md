## Description

We promise you won't miss the meat in this speedy vegetarian makeover of a Middle Eastern classic. Mashed lentils, spiced with ras el hanout, make the base of the kofta, which is smothered in a harissa mayo, topped with feta cheese and then all wrapped up in a cosy blanket of tortilla. That's a wrap!
