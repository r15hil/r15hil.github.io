## Instructions

### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic and pepper strips and cook for 8-10 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

While the onion and pepper are softening, add the ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of sugar and salt and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix

### Step 4

Add the gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain, then combine the king prawns with the Cajun-style spice mix in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – these are your Cajun-style spiced king prawns

### Step 6

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Once the veg has softened, add the Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated

### Step 7

Add the Cajun-style spiced king prawns with the creamy stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked and the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add the drained gluten free linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy Cajun-style king prawn & pepper linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy Cajun-style king prawn & pepper gluten free linguine in bowls and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
