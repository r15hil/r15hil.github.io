## Ingredients

- Sliced prosciutto (52g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Baby button mushrooms (80g)
- Rocket (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Slice your button mushrooms finely


### Step 2

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with your dried oregano and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base


### Step 4

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the tomato base between your pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the sliced mushrooms and torn mozzarella

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!


### Step 5

Put the tray in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your mushroom pizza[s]


### Step 6

While the pizza[s] are cooking, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove from the heat and set aside to infuse until serving – this is your garlic oil

Wash your rocket, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the mushroom pizza[s] from the oven and top with your sliced prosciutto and rocket – this is your prosciutto, mushroom & rocket pizza[s]

### Step 8

Serve the prosciutto, mushroom & rocket pizza[s] with the garlic oil drizzled all over

Enjoy!
