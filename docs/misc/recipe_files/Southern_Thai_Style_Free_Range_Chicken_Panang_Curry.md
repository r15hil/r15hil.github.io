### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

### Step 5

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and peanut butter in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Add your ground turmeric, fish sauce, lime leaf[ves] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your peanut stock

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1691481521906-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into small bite-sized pieces

Once the pepper and onion have softened, increase the heat to high, then add the chopped chicken and your red Thai curry paste to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the peanut stock and cook for 7-8 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Season with a pinch of salt and discard the lime leaf[ves] – this is your Southern Thai-style free range chicken panang curry

Tip: If the curry is looking a little dry, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the Southern Thai-style free range chicken panang curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
