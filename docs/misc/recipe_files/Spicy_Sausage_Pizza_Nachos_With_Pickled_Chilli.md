## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp) x0
- Dried basil (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Dried chilli flakes (1tsp)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Green chilli
- Red pepper
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Squeeze your sausage meat from the skins (clean hands is the best way!) and discard the skins


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage meat to the pan and cook for 5-7 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, stack your tortillas and slice them into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 4

Whilst the nachos are cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice finely

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Once the sausage meat has browned, add the sliced shallot and diced pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Add 1/3 of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs further, then add your chopped tomatoes with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water and a pinch of salt


### Step 6

Cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced to a bolognese-like consistency and the meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy sausage sauce

Meanwhile, slice your green chilli[es] finely

Combine the sliced green chilli and half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl with a splash of water and a pinch of sugar

Mix it all together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli


### Step 7

Combine your mayo with your dried oregano, dried basil, remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), remaining white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/1 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your garlic & herb mayo

### Step 8

Serve the spicy sausage sauce over the nachos

Drizzle over the garlic & herb mayo and garnish with the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
