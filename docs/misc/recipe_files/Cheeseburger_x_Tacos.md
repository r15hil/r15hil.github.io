### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potato[es] (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined tray with your ground smoked paprika, a little drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries

### Step 2

Boil a little water in a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Combine your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl with the sliced onion and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water – this is your quick-pickled onion

### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it very finely

### Step 4

Combine your tomato ketchup, mayo and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your spicy burger sauce

### Step 5

Once the fries have been cooking for 15 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 6 min or until cooked through and slightly crisp (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Once cooked through and slightly crisp, gently push the cooked mince into the centre of pan

Top the mince with the grated cheddar and cook, covered, for a final 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy beef

### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a baking tray

Put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

Drain the quick-pickled onion and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Load each warmed tortilla with a dollop of spicy burger sauce, (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) some shredded lettuce and chopped tomato

Top with a handful of smoky fries, cheesy beef and quick-pickled onion – these are your cheeseburger x tacos

Serve any remaining spicy burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!
