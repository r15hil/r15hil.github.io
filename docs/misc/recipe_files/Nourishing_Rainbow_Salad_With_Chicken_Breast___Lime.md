Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut each beetroot into 8 wedges

### Step 2

Place the carrot batons, beetroot wedges and chicken breast portions on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Sprinkle the cumin seeds over, then drizzle with the honey and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and return to the pot
