## Ingredients

- Panko breadcrumbs (20g)
- Mayonnaise (25ml)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Spring onion
- Sugar snap peas (80g)
- Apple
- White miso paste (17g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Carrot
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Parsley (5g)
- Red chilli
- Lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until they're cooked through and crisp


### Step 2

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Strip your parsley leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely, leaving the leaves whole

Combine the lime zest, panko breadcrumbs, chopped parsley stalks, and a drizzle olive oil with a pinch of salt – this is your breadcrumb mix


### Step 3

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your sugar snap peas finely

Trim your spring onion[s] and chop finely on a diagonal

Grate your apple[s]

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips


### Step 4

Mix the grated carrot, apple, sliced sugar snaps, sliced spring onion, and parsley leaves with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) together in a bowl

Set aside for later – this is your sugar snap slaw


### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry and add to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Spread half of your miso paste (save the rest for later!) over the basa fillet[s] and top with the breadcrumb mixture

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your panko baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Combine the remaining miso paste with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> boiled water and stir until the sugar has dissolved

Stir in your mayo – this is your miso mayo

Add the juice of half of your lime, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt to the sugar snap slaw and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Once the chips are cooked, sprinkle them with your toasted sesame seeds – these are your sesame chips

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the panko baked basa with the sesame chips, sugar snap slaw and miso mayo to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
