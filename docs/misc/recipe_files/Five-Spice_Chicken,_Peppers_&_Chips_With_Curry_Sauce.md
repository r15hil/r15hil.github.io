### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min

### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the oven, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Cut your spring onion[s] into quarters

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

After the initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the sliced peppers, quartered spring onions and chopped garlic

Add a small drizzle of vegetable oil and sprinkle over your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 2/3 of your five-spice mix (you'll use the rest later!) and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 18-22 min or until everything's tender and slightly charred – these are your five-spice vegetables

### Step 4

While the vegetables are in the oven, add the diced chicken thigh to a medium bowl with the remaining five-spice mix, 2/3 of your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together – this is your coated five-spice chicken

Boil half a kettle

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated five-spice chicken thigh and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden, turning occasionally – this is your crispy five-spice chicken

### Step 6

When everything's nearly ready, add the remaining cornflour and your curry powder to a small bowl with your ginger & garlic paste and half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!)

Gradually stir in 140ml <span class="text-purple">[180ml]</span> [ <span class="text-danger">[240ml] </span>boiled water (this is to ensure there's no lumps!) – this is your curry sauce mix

Put the curry sauce mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring half way – this is your curry sauce

### Step 7

Remove the five-spice vegetables from the oven and add the crispy five-spice chicken with the remaining chicken stock mix

Mix everything together until fully coated – this is your five-spice chicken, peppers & chips

### Step 8

Serve the five-spice chicken, peppers & chips with the curry sauce to the side

Enjoy!
