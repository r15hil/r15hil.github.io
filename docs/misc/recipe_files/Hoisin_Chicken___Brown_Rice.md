## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and mangetout

Tear in your chestnut mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook everything for 5 min or until starting to soften and brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour, hoisin sauce and the soy sauce with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold water

Whisk until smooth – this is your hoisin sauce


### Step 4

Add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for a further 2 min


### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 6

Add your hoisin sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) - this is your hoisin chicken


### Step 7

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s]


### Step 8

Serve the hoisin chicken with the cooked brown rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped spring onion and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
