### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries 

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Remove the stems from your portobello mushrooms

Chop the stems in half

Once hot, add the portobello mushrooms and halved stems to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until starting to brown

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your soy sauce and chopped garlic to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>cold water and cook, covered, for a further 12-13 min or until the mushrooms are soft and the soy sauce has reduced

### Step 4

While the mushrooms are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>lengthways until you have thin strips

Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

### Step 5

Combine your mayo and red chilli relish in a small bowl – this is your chilli mayo

### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

### Step 7

Once the mushrooms are cooked, transfer them to a clean board and shred them apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled mushroom to the pan and mix it all up until fully coated in the sauce

### Step 8

To serve, spread the toasted brioche halves with chilli mayo, then load them up with the cucumber matchsticks, spring onion strips, pulled portobello mushroom and crispy onions – these are your pulled portobello mushroom burgers

Sprinkle the fries with your toasted sesame seeds and serve them with any remaining chilli mayo

Enjoy!
