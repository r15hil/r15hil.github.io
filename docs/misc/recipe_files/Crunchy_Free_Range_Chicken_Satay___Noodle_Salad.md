## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your lettuce, then cut into thin wedges, lengthways


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened slightly

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Coat your free range chicken breast portion[s] in your curry powder

Once softened, transfer the pepper and onion to a clean plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat (no need to clean!)


### Step 4

Add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 3 min on each sides

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles and return to the large bowl


### Step 6

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add the chopped creamed coconut and peanut butter to a bowl and add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Whisk everything together until you have a smooth paste

Stir your soy sauce, red chilli relish and chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) into the paste – this is your satay dressing


### Step 7

Add the lettuce wedges, cooked pepper and onion to the bowl with the drained noodles and give everything a good mix up – this is your noodle salad

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced free range chicken over the noodle salad

Drizzle the satay dressing over the top

Enjoy!
