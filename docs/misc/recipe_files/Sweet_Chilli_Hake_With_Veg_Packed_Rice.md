## Ingredients

- Maple syrup (15g)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- Spring onion
- White long grain rice (130g)
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- Cornflour (1tsp) x0
- White long grain rice (65g) x0
- Blanched peas (160g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and chop into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the diced carrot and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Combine your cornflour and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add the chopped hake pieces and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

While the fish is cooking, combine your maple syrup, red chilli relish and 30ml <span class="text-purple">[45ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60ml]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce


### Step 5

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the hake pieces are cooked through, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Add your sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your sweet chilli hake


### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Once the rice is cooked, add the refreshed peas and remaining soy sauce and mix everything together – this is your veg-packed rice


### Step 7

Remove the sweet chilli hake from the heat and add your toasted sesame seeds to the pan

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed rice with the sweet chilli hake over the top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
