## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 2 basa fillets
- 150g basmati rice
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes 
- 60g panko breadcrumbs 
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 4 soy sauce sachets (32ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the basmati&nbsp;rice, 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span>&nbsp;water and a very large pinch&nbsp;of both salt and sugar to a pot (with a lid) and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and stir vigorously for 1 min, before covering for 15-20 min or until most of the water is absorbed, stirring occasionally&nbsp;


### Step 2

Once&nbsp;the rice is cooked, set aside and keep covered until serving&nbsp;


Meanwhile, slice the basa fillets in half lengthways and cut each half into bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


### Step 3

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a large mixing bowl


Add the fish pieces and coat them in the breadcrumbs to make fish nuggets (press the breadcrumbs onto the fish with clean hands)


### Step 4

Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) finely


Combine the ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, chilli flakes (Can't handle the heat? Go easy), half of the rice vinegar and&nbsp;1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;


Mix well &ndash;&nbsp;this is your Asian dipping sauce&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the sugar snap peas and cook for 4 min or until the skin starts to blacken slightly


Transfer the charred sugar snaps to a bowl and cover to keep warm


Reserve the pan for the next step


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil


Once hot, add the breaded fish nuggets and cook on both sides for 1 min or until crispy and golden


Transfer the cooked nuggets to a plate and season generously with salt and pepper


Tip:&nbsp;cook in batches if needed


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the remaining rice&nbsp;vinegar to the rice and stir well to create 'sticky' rice


Press the rice into small containers and turn out onto serving plates for authentic presentation

### Step 8

Serve the sticky rice with the nuggets, charred sugar snap peas and the Asian dipping sauce to the side


Enjoy!
