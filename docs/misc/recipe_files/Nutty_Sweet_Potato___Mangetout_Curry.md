## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat, then once hot, add your peanuts and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, add in your mango chutney, give everything a good mix and cook for 1 min or until the peanuts are evenly coated, then transfer to a plate (save the pan!) and place in the fridge – these are your mango-glazed peanuts


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Slice half your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds (save them for garnish!), then chop the remaining chilli finely

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 4

While the garlic and ginger is softening, peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to lightly brown


### Step 5

While the sweet potato is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and peanut butter in 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [460ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your nutty coconut stock

Add your curry powder to the pan with the nutty coconut stock and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span>[1 tsp]</span> sugar, mix everything together and cook for 1-2 min


### Step 6

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Add the chopped pepper to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the sweet potato has softened


### Step 7

After an intial 10 min, add your mangetout to the pan and cook for 2 min further or until refreshed and crunchy – this is your nutty sweet potato & mangetout curry

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Remove the mango-glazed peanuts from the fridge and chop them roughly

### Step 8

Serve the nutty sweet potato & mangetout curry in a bowl

Top with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped mango-glazed peanuts and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
