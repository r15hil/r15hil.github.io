## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways and wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once done, drain the tortiglioni and set it aside for later

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and most of your goats' cheese (you'll use the rest later!) in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water – this is your cheesy stock

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 5

Once the leeks have slightly softened, add your dried oregano and halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add the cheesy stock with the spinach and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, or until the sauce has thickened slightly


### Step 7

Add the drained tortiglioni to the sauce with most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and mix everything together – this is your cheesy leek & spinach pasta

Add the cheesy leek & spinach pasta to an oven-proof dish, then crumble over the remaining goats' cheese

Top with your pine nut & seed mix and put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and crispy – this is your goats’ cheese, leek & spinach pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve the goats’ cheese, leek & spinach pasta bake topped with the reserved chopped basil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
