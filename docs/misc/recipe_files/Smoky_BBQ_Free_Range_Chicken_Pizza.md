### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into thin strips

### Step 2

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then chop into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced chicken and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the BBQ sauce between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella

### Step 8

Serve the smoky BBQ free range chicken pizza with a generous grind of black pepper
