## Ingredients

- Tomato paste (32g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Green pepper
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into thin strips


### Step 2

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then chop into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced chicken and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tomato paste to a jug with your ground smoked paprika, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and a generous grind of black pepper

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your BBQ sauce


### Step 5

Drain your mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the BBQ sauce between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, divide the cooked chicken & pepper evenly between the pizza base[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the mozzarella has melted and the pizza base[s] is crisp – this is your smoky BBQ free range chicken pizza

### Step 8

Serve the smoky BBQ free range chicken pizza with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
