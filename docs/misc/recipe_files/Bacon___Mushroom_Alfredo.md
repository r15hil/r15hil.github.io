## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Once the lardons are golden, reduce the heat to medium-high and crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands

Add your roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine, soft cheese and a generous pinch of salt to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 2 min or until thickened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the drained spaghetti to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 30 secs further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your bacon & mushroom alfredo

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Top the bacon & mushroom alfredo with your grated Italian hard cheese and chopped parsley

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
