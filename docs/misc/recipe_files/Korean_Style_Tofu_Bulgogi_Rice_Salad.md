## Instructions


### Step 1

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Grate the tofu

Combine your cornflour and grated tofu in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coated tofu


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-15 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy tofu


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Grate your apple[s] (skin on) and discard the core[s]

Chop your mangetout roughly

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then remove the outer leaves and pat dry with kitchen paper

Shred the inner core


### Step 5

Combine your gochujang (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger & garlic paste, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar, tamari soy sauce and most of your toasted sesame seeds (save some for garnish!) – this is your bulgogi-style sauce


### Step 6

Once the tofu is crispy, add the grated apple and cook for 5 min or until the apple has started to softened

Once softened, add the bulgogi-style sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your bulgogi-style tofu


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, top the rice with the chopped mangetout and put the lid back on for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Once warmed through, add the lettuce leaves and shredded core to a large bowl with the cooked rice & mangetout

Give everything a good mix up – this is your rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the bulgogi-style tofu on top of the rice salad

Garnish with the reserved toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
