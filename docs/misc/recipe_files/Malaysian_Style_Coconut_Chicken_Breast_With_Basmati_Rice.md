### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your chicken breast portion[s] and sprinkle over half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and then slice finely

### Step 3

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

### Step 4

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid, and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and chop the softer inner stem[s] finely

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s], garlic and ginger

Chop half your red chilli[es] roughly, and finely slice the rest into rounds (save these for garnish!)

Put everything into a food processor (can't handle the heat? Go easy on the chilli!)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1693815415270-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add your ground almonds and the remaining ground turmeric to the food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Add your soy sauce and a pinch of sugar

Pulse until you're left with a slightly chunky paste – this is your spice paste

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1693815418930-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Boil half a kettle, then add the spice paste to the chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tamarind paste with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Once done, add the chopped creamed coconut and cook for 1 min further – this is your Malaysian-style coconut chicken breast

### Step 8

Using two forks, pull the cooked chicken apart into big chunks

Serve the Malaysian-style coconut chicken breast with the basmati rice and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
