### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coriander seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the coriander seeds to a pestle & mortar and crush roughly

Reserve the pan

### Step 3

Cut the chicken breast strips into small bite-sized pieces

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until browned

### Step 4

While the chicken is browning, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Once browned, transfer the chicken to a plate, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the sliced onion to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, peanut butter and chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[650ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and crushed coriander seeds to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Increase the heat to medium, add your cherry tomatoes and coconut stock and cook for 7-9 min or until thickened

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!)

Add the browned chicken and chopped coriander to the sauce and cook for 2 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Brazilian-style chicken & coriander curry

Cut your lime[s] into wedges

Add the juice of half the lime wedges to the curry (save the rest for garnish!)

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style chicken & coriander curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
