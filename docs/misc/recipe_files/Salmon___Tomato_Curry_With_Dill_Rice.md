## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 2 tomatoes 
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 130g white long grain rice
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 2 x 110g skin-on salmon fillets
- 15g ginger paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 10g dill
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a pot with a matching lid, with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Add the white long grain rice to the pot with a pinch or salt and cook for 2 min or until the rice has darkened slightly in colour


### Step 2

Add 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the tomatoes into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Add the salmon fillets (skin-side up) to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through once it's opaque and flakes easily!

Once cooked, peel the skin off the salmon and discard


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the curry powder, chopped garlic, ginger paste and tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the tomatoes start to break down

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and chopped creamed coconut in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further until thickened slightly

Once thickened, add the cooked salmon to the pan, and spoon the sauce over – this is your salmon & tomato curry

### Step 8

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, add a knob of butter, the chopped dill and season generously with salt and pepper – this is your dill rice

Serve the salmon & tomato curry over the dill rice

Enjoy!
