## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then chop your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters (scrape the seeds and pith out with a spoon)

Separate the white fat and the duck jelly from your duck leg[s]

Add the chopped pepper to a tin foil-lined baking tray, top with the duck leg[s], white fat, duck jelly, season with a pinch of salt and pepper then put in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the cooked rice to a plate (reserve the pot) and spread it out flat to help it cool down and boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways until you have thin strips

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your spiced plum chutney and your hoisin sauce in a small bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), your rice vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar, your ginger paste and cornflour

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml]</span> boiled water and mix well – this is your plum mix


### Step 4

Wash, then add your spinach to a colander, pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt, then rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then combine with half your toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt – this is your sesame spinach


### Step 5

Once the duck has 10 min left, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the plum mix and cook for 2-3 min or until reduced to a glossy sauce – this is your plum sauce


### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooled rice, chopped garlic and the remaining toasted sesame oil and cook for 2-3 min or until everything is combined and the rice is heated through


### Step 7

Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pot and crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into the other side

Stir the egg with a wooden spoon to break the yolk<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 1-2 min or until resembling scrambled egg

Once resembling scrambled egg, mix it all through the rice along with the remaining soy sauce – this is your egg fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the roasted duck leg and roasted pepper with the egg fried rice and sesame spinach

Drizzle over any roasting juices

Pour over the plum sauce and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
