### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

### Step 3

Add most of your peri peri seasoning to a plate (you’ll use the rest later!) with a generous pinch of salt

### Step 4

Press your flattened chicken breast portion[s] onto the plate to evenly coat all over – this is your coated chicken

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

### Step 6

Whilst the chicken is cooking, combine your mayo with the remaining peri peri seasoning and 1/3 of your cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!)

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of pepper and stir together – this is your peri peri mayo

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1723558652429-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add your blanched peas to the pot with a knob of butter, your chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together, cover and leave to stand for 2-3 min or until the peas are warmed through – this is your buttery rice & peas

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced peri peri chicken with the buttery rice & peas and your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the side

Drizzle the peri peri mayo over the chicken

Top the slaw mix with the remaining cider vinegar and drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
