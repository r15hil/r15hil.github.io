## Description

Rich, creamy and tangy, ranch is a classic American dressing. For a lighter take on the original, we've replaced the traditional buttermilk and mayo with natural yoghurt. Tossed with caramelised red onion, nutritious kale & lentils and topped with lean chicken breast. Kale-orie cut but still delish!

Heat a <span class="text-highlight">large,</span> wide-based pan<span class="text-highlight"> (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid)</span> with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat 


Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-15 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 2

Meanwhile, place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left <span class="text-highlight">with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces</span>


### Step 3

Add the sliced chicken to a baking tray 


Drizzle with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop the chives finely, including the stalks


Combine the natural yoghurt with the white wine vinegar, dried oregano and chopped chives in a small bowl


Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your ranch-style dressing


### Step 5

Drain and rinse the canned lentils


### Step 6

Once the chicken is almost done, add the pumpkin seeds to the tray and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted


### Step 7

Once the onions are caramelised, add the shredded kale to the pan with a splash of water


Cover with a lid and cook for 3-5 min or until wilted


Once wilted, add the drained lentils and a generous pinch of salt and give it a good mix up 


Transfer everything to a large bowl, add most of the ranch-style dressing and give everything a good mix up<span class="text-highlight"> – this is your kale salad</span>

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken breast finely 


Serve the sliced chicken over the kale salad


Dollop with the remaining ranch-style dressing and garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds


Enjoy!
