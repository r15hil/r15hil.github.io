### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano all over, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the onion wedges and tomato wedges to one side of a separate baking tray (or two!) and set aside for later

### Step 3

Add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together, then add your chicken breast portion[s] and turn several times until fully coated in all the spices – this is your paprika chicken

### Step 4

Add the paprika chicken to the tray[s] with the onion and tomato and drizzle everything with olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables have softened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli

### Step 6

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – this is your charred pepper

### Step 7

Slice the cooked paprika chicken finely on a clean board

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Place the salad on a plate and top with the crispy potatoes, roasted onion and tomato, sliced paprika chicken and charred pepper – this is your Spanish-style chicken breast & charred pepper salad

Drizzle the spicy aioli all over

Enjoy!
