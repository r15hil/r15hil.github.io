Chop your green chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)


### Step 3

Add the halved shallot and peeled garlic to a food processor with the chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt

Add your creamed coconut, basil, the juice of your lime[s], fish sauce, half your roasted peanuts (save the rest for later!) and 1 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 1/2 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry pesto

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Finely chop the ingredients and grind in a pestle & mortar instead!


### Step 4

Add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Chop the remaining roasted peanuts roughly


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through


### Step 7

Once the king prawns are cooked through, add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the Thai green curry pesto and chopped tomatoes

Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated – this is your king prawn Thai-style green pesto pasta

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn Thai-style green pesto pasta and garnish with the chopped roasted peanuts

Enjoy!
