## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Add your diced beef to the dish with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until very lightly browned all over


### Step 4

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your leek[s] into rounds and wash thoroughly to remove any grit

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into thick discs


### Step 5

Add the chopped leek to the dish with the chopped carrot and your baby button mushrooms and stir it all together

Add your beef stock mix, 450ml <span class="text-purple">[590ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[770ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil then cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 55 min


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once the stew has been cooking for 25 min, add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice


### Step 7

After an initial 55 min, add your gochujang (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted sesame oil and ginger & garlic paste to the stew

Stir it all together, cover with the lid and return to the oven for a final 5 min or until the beef is cooked through – this is your oven baked spicy Korean-style beef & leek stew

### Step 8

Serve the oven baked spicy Korean-style beef & leek stew with the baked rice to the side

Season with black pepper
