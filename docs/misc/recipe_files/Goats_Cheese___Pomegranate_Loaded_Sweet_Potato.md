- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pierce your sweet potatoes with a fork, and add them to a large heat-proof bowl covered with cling film

Cook in the microwave for 5-7 min or until slightly softened


### Step 2

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Drain and rinse your<span class="text-danger"> </span>chickpeas


### Step 3

Add the onion wedges and<span class="text-danger"> </span>the<span class="text-danger"> </span>drained chickpeas to a baking tray with your ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chickpeas are crunchy and the onion is roasted – these are your crunchy spiced chickpeas & roasted onion


### Step 4

Transfer the softened sweet potatoes to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Sprinkle over your ground coriander and season with a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the skins are crispy


### Step 5

While everything's in the oven, cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate, then slice into quarters

Place the pomegranate quarters into a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and set them aside for later


### Step 6

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped parsley with your natural yoghurt, white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your yoghurt dressing

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Remove the baked sweet potatoes from the oven after the initial 15 min and carefully slice in half lengthways

Crumble half your goats' cheese (save the rest for later!) over the sweet potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and return the tray to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the goats' cheese has slightly melted – these are your goats' cheese loaded sweet potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the salad on plates with the crunchy spiced chickpeas, and roasted onion over the top

Top with the goats' cheese loaded sweet potatoes and crumble the remaining goats' cheese all over

Drizzle the yoghurt dressing on top and sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds

Enjoy!
