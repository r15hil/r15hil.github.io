## Description

To whip up a tasty risotto in half the time, you'll swap rice for a rice-shaped pasta called orzo, and simmer it in a garlic-infused cream cheese sauce. Finish with more cheese, a sprinkle of basil and then top with a garlicy roasted portobello mushroom. Buon appetito!

## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 120g spinach
- 0 orzo
- 50g soft cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 150g orzo pasta
- 0 chestnut mushrooms
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 0 spinach
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Mix the chopped garlic with a generous knob of butter in a small bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic butter

Tip: If your butter is not soft then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!

Add your portobello mushroom[s] to a baking tray and top with the garlic butter, then put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the mushroom[s] is tender and juicy – this is your garlic roasted portobello mushroom


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until browned

Once the mushrooms have browned, add the diced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> milk – this is your stock


### Step 5

Add your orzo to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the stock and soft cheese and cook, covered, stirring frequently, for 10-12 min, or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite

Tip: Stirring the orzo will release the starch from the pasta, making it creamier!


### Step 6

While the orzo is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the orzo is cooked, add the spinach and the grated cheese and cook for a further 1-2 min, stirring until wilted

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy mushroom & spinach orzo

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mushroom & spinach orzo in a bowl and top with a garlic roasted portobello mushroom

Garnish with the chopped basil and a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!
