Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add turkey mince and cook for 2 min, breaking up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once done, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water

Add a splash of the starchy noodle water â€“ this is your Thai turkey noodle stir-fry

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Thai turkey noodle stir-fry and garnish with the roasted peanuts and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Tear the basil leaves over

Enjoy!
