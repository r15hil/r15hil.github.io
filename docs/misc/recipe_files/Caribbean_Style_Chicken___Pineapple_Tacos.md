## Ingredients

- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground allspice (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- British skinless chicken thighs (160g) x0
- Mini cosberg lettuce
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- British skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Garlic clove
- Coriander (5g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your ground allspice, ground smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix together

Add the chicken thighs to the plate and turn them several times until they're fully coated in all the spices – this is your coated chicken


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 9 min on each side or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, drain and finely chop your pineapple, reserve 1/2 tsp per person of pineapple juice

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s] and chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Wash, then shred your lettuce[s] finely


### Step 4

Combine the chopped pineapple, diced shallot and chopped coriander in a bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your pineapple salsa


### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo and reserved pineapple juice in a separate bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pineapple mayo


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with the chopped garlic and cook over a medium-high heat for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your Caribbean-style chicken


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Assemble the tacos by topping the warmed tortillas with the shredded lettuce, Caribbean-style chicken and pineapple salsa

Drizzle over the pineapple mayo

Enjoy!
