## Ingredients

- 1 pine nut & seed mix sachet (30g)
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 white potatoes
- 120g asparagus spears
- 1 British free-range egg
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 350°F/ Gas 4

Boil a kettle

Trim the woody ends off the asparagus spears and add them to a baking tray

Drizzle the trimmed asparagus with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt, then put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the asparagus is tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until they're fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the zest and juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to a small bowl

Add the mayo and a generous pinch of both salt and pepper to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemonaise

Cut the remaining lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>wedges


### Step 4

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork

Combine the panko breadcrumbs and the pine nut & seed mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>in a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt


### Step 5

Coat the basa fillets in the flour, tap off the excess, then dip them into the beaten egg and finally press them into the seed & breadcrumb mix firmly to coat everything evenly – these are your seeded fish fillets


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seeded fish fillets and cook for 3-4 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through

Tip: Add some extra oil if your pan is looking dry


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a large knob of butter

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Serve the seeded fish fillets over the mashed potato with the roasted asparagus and lemonaise to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
