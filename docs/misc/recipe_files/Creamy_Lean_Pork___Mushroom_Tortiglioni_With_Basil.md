### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min, stirring occasionally until golden and caramelised

### Step 2

While the mushrooms are cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a large cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 3

Reboil half a kettle

Once the mushrooms are golden, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 5

Add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to the consistency of a ragù

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Once the ragù has thickened, add your soft cheese and drained tortiglioni to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water

Season with salt and pepper and stir until the sauce coats the pasta and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy lean pork and mushroom tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy lean pork and mushroom tortiglioni topped with the grated cheese and chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
