## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 160g puff pastry
- 2 white potatoes
- 10g parsley & dill
- 2 x 100g smoked basa fillets
- 1 leek
- 80g spinach

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top and tail

Slice half the leek finely and chop the remaining leek into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>pieces

Chop the parsley & dill finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the wedges are beginning to brown

Chop the smoked basa fillets into small, bite-sized pieces

Grate the cheddar cheese finely

Wash the spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min until softened

Once softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the leek – this is your leek roux


### Step 4

Gradually whisk 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>milk into the leek roux, a little at a time, and cook for 3-4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once thickened, add the chopped smoked basa, chopped parsley & dill, half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), a generous grind of black pepper and stir until the cheese has melted – this is your pasty filling


### Step 5

Dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the puff pastry into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4] </span>rectangles and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 6

Divide the pasty filling between the pastry rectangles, covering only one half and brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together then use a fork to crimp along the join and prick an air hole in the centre of each sealed pastry rectangle

Top with the remaining grated cheese, then put the tray in the oven for 17-20 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your cheesy leek & smoked basa pasties


### Step 7

Once the wedges have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the leek pieces with a drizzle of olive oil

Return the tray to the oven for a further 10 min or until the leek has softened and the wedges are golden and crisp

Once the leek has softened, remove the tray from the oven and top the leek with the spinach and return it to the oven for a final 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your roasted leek & spinach

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy leek & smoked basa pasties with the wedges and roasted leek & spinach to the side

Enjoy!
