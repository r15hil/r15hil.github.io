## Ingredients

- 8ml sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 300g edamame & jasmine rice
- 300g rainbow veg mix
- 15ml tamari soy sauce
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 250g British diced chicken breast
- 25g honey
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for 6 min or until golden


### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over high heat

Once hot, add the rainbow veg mix and cook for 3 min or until the veg has slightly softened but still has some crunch

Once the veg has slightly softened, add the ginger & garlic paste and the edamame & jasmine rice and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine the honey, tamari, sriracha and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your spicy sauce

Once the chicken is golden, transfer it to the rice pan and add the spicy sauce (reserve the pan!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and everything is piping hot – this is your chicken nasi-goreng


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Shake your eggs before cracking for a perfectly-centred yolk

### Step 5

Serve the chicken nasi-goreng topped with a fried egg and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!
