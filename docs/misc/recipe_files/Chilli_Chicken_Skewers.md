## Description

We’ve teamed up with Fussels home-grown rapeseed oil for this recipe. Rapeseed oil has half the saturated fat of olive oil, is a fantastic source of vitamin E, and is downright delicious. We’ve used Fussels chilli oil two ways in this recipe, to create crispy, spicy potatoes and also to add some chilli attitude to the chicken kebabs.
