## Ingredients

- 6 Meatless Farm sausages (300g)
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 pot of wholegrain mustard (21g)
- 5g rosemary
- 1 pot of honey (25g)
- 150g spring greens
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into thick discs

Cut the red onions into wedges through the root, keeping the skin on

Tip: Cutting through the root ensures that they stay together while cooking


### Step 2

Add the red onion wedges and potato discs to one side of a large baking tray

Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper

Add the meat-free sausages to a sheet of tin foil, scrunching up the edges, and place on the other side (alternatively, use separate trays)


### Step 3

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min, or until the onions are tender

Meanwhile, combine the honey and wholegrain mustard in a small mixing bowl – this is your honey mustard mixture

Strip the rosemary leaves from the stems, discard of the stems and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 5

Once the onions are tender, transfer them to a chopping board to cool

Flip the potato discs

Pour the honey mustard mixture over the browned meat-free sausages


### Step 6

Return the potato discs and meat-free sausages to the oven for 5 min or until the honey mustard mixture is hot and sticky

Once the onions are cool enough to handle, remove the skins

Separate the roasted onion into petals


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the chopped rosemary and garlic and the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min

Add a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for a final 1-2 min or until tender but retaining a slight crunch, then remove from the heat – these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Serve the golden potato discs, garlicky greens and onion petals all tumbled together

Top with the sticky meat-free sausages

Enjoy!
