## Ingredients

- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- British diced chicken thigh (250g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- White potato x4
- Garlic clove x2
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sweetcorn (no need to drain) to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly caramelised then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 1-2 min

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the sweetcorn is caramelising, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Once slightly caramelised, add the diced onion and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and Dijon mustard in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [80ml]</span> milk – this is your chicken stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your diced chicken thigh to the pan with your dried thyme and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly browned

Once lightly browned, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened – this is your chicken & sweetcorn pie filling


### Step 6

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a large knob of butter

Season with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth


### Step 7

Transfer the chicken & sweetcorn pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the mash

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until it's bubbling and golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & sweetcorn potato-topped pie

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & sweetcorn potato-topped pie

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
