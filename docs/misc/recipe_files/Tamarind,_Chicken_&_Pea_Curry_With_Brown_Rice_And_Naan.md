### Step 7

Add the blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1 min or until they're warm  and your chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tamarind, chicken & pea curry

Serve the tamarind, chicken & pea curry with the cooked brown rice and warmed naan to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with the crispy onions

Enjoy!
