## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 4

Add your chicken thighs and cherry tomatoes to the tray[s] with the red onion wedges, the juice of your lemon[s], the chopped garlic and dried oregano

Drizzle with olive oil, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

### Step 5

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min, mixing halfway, or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)
