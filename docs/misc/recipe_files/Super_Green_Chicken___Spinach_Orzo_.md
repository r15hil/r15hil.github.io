## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out the fridge, open the packet and let it air 

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and roughly chop your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and spinach with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted

Once wilted, add the cooked spinach to a food processor and blitz until smooth

Reserve the pan


### Step 3

Whilst the spinach is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into small bite-sized pieces

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over


### Step 5

Add your orzo to the browned chicken and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), the orzo is tender with a slight bite and most of the liquid has been absorbed


### Step 6

Whilst the orzo is cooking, chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the cherry tomatoes and tomato wedges to a baking tray with your oregano, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until softening and starting to burst


### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Once everything is cooked, add your soft cheese and blitzed spinach to the orzo and stir it all together

Tip: Add a splash more boiled water if it looks a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the roasted tomatoes over the green chicken & spinach orzo

Sprinkle over the grated cheddar and finish with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
