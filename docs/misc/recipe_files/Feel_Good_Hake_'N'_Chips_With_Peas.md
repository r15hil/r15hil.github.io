### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives with your panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt in a small bowl

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and stir it all together until all of the breadcrumbs are coated in the oil – this is your chive crumb

### Step 3

Add your hake fillet[s] to a separate baking tray and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Top the hake evenly with the chive crumb and press it into the hake using the back of a spoon

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your breaded hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily
