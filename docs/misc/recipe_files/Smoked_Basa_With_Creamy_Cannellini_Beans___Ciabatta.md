## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel, then slice your shallot[s] roughly

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, Dijon mustard and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy Dijon stock


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Once the shallot has slightly softened, add the drained cannellini beans and chopped green beans to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans have begun to soften


### Step 5

While the beans are softening, chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Once the beans are slightly softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the creamy Dijon stock to the pan and top with the chopped smoked basa and a crack of black pepper

Cook, covered, for 5 min or until your fish is cooked through – this is your smoked basa with creamy cannellini beans

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until hot and crusty

Spread a little butter over the crusty ciabatta[s] and cut into triangles

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa with creamy cannellini beans with the crusty ciabatta to the side

Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
