### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Cut your cauliflower into large florets, discard the stem and leaves

Add the cauliflower florets to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until beginning to crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!) and combine with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 4

Heat a separate pot over a medium heat with your toasted sesame oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your peanut butter, tamari soy sauce and coconut stock to the pot with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for a further 6-8 min or until the sauce thickens, stirring occasionally

Once thickened, remove the pot from the heat, add the juice of half your lime[s], then stir it all together and set aside to cool – this is your peanut dressing

### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 7

Once cooked, fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add to a large bowl with your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and half the chopped herbs (save the rest for garnish!)

Add half the peanut dressing (you'll use the rest later!) to the bowl and toss – this is your rainbow salad

### Step 8

Serve the rainbow salad and top with the roasted cauliflower florets

Drizzle over the remaining peanut dressing and garnish with the remaining chopped herbs, chopped peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
