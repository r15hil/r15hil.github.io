- Skin on salmon fillets (2pcs)
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Spring onion
- White long grain rice (130g)
- White long grain rice (65g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the diced carrot and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 3

Combine half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with your maple syrup, red chilli relish and 30ml <span class="text-purple">[45ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [60ml]</span> cold water in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the skin has started to crisp

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 5

Once the salmon skin is starting to crisp, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Add the sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 6-7 min turning once halfway, or until the salmon is cooked through and the sauce has thickened

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over to refresh them

Once the rice is cooked, add the refreshed peas, black sesame seeds and remaining soy sauce and mix everything together – this is your veg-packed rice


### Step 7

Once done, add your toasted sesame seeds to the pan with the salmon – this is your sweet chilli salmon

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed rice with the sweet chilli salmon over the top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
