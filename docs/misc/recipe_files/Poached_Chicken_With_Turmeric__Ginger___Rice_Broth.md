- 15ml rice vinegar	
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 100g brown rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 15ml soy sauce
- 0 ground turmeric
- 2 British chicken breast portions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the ginger (no need to peel!) into rounds

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Season the chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and add them to a cold, dry pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)

Rinse the brown rice, then add the brown rice, sliced shallot, sliced garlic and sliced ginger to the pan with the chicken


### Step 3

Pour over 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> cold water and bring to a boil, covered, over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, turning the chicken half way, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, slice the chestnut mushrooms

Add the sliced mushrooms to a tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the mushrooms are cooked and starting to crisp – these are your roasted mushrooms


### Step 5

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water

Add the ground turmeric, cracked black pepper (not a fan of pepper? Go easy!), soy sauce and rice vinegar – this is your turmeric stock


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board – this is your poached chicken

Add the turmeric stock to the pan, bring to the boil over a high heat, and cook, covered, for 3-5 min further or until the rice is cooked and tender – this is your turmeric, ginger & rice broth

Tip: Add a splash more water if the rice has soaked up a lot of broth!


### Step 7

Wash, then add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

Finely slice the poached chicken

### Step 8

Serve the sliced poached chicken, roasted mushrooms and wilted spinach over the turmeric, ginger & rice broth

Tip: Remove the sliced ginger rounds!

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
