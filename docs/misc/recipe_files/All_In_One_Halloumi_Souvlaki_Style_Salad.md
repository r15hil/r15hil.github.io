## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your waxy potatoes in half


### Step 3

Add the onion wedges, tomato wedges, chopped pepper and halved waxy potatoes to an oven-proof dish

Add your dried oregano, cumin seeds and ground smoked paprika with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until everything is fully coated and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the veg is beginning to char


### Step 4

While the veg is cooking, slice your halloumi into 3 pieces per person

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and rip the outer leaves into rough, bite-sized pieces

Shred the inner core[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 5

After an initial 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and top the roast vegetables with the sliced halloumi

Return the dish to the oven for 15 min or until the vegetables are cooked and the halloumi is golden – this is your souvlaki-style halloumi & roasted veg


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with your red wine vinegar, mint sauce and grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your minty yoghurt


### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the golden halloumi to a plate

Add the lettuce leaves, shredded lettuce and minty yoghurt dressing to the dish

Give everything a good mix up until coated in dressing – this is your souvlaki-style salad with minty yoghurt

### Step 8

Top the souvlaki salad with the golden halloumi – this is your all-in-one halloumi souvlaki-style salad with minty yoghurt

Enjoy!
