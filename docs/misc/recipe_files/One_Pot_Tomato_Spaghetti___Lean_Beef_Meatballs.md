### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and grate the remaining half, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your lean beef mince and grated onion with half of the grated garlic (you’ll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and using clean hands, give everything a good mix up until fully combined

### Step 2

Divide the lean beef mince and shape into 3 meatballs per person (clean hands is the best way!)

Heat a large pot (with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef meatballs to the pot and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally, until they're browned on all sides

Once browned, transfer to a plate and wipe the pot and reserve for later (these will finish cooking with the spaghetti later)

### Step 3

While the meatballs are browning, chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

### Step 4

Once the meatballs are browned, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced brown onion and remaining grated garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

### Step 5

Add your dried oregano to the pot with your chopped tomatoes, red wine vinegar, beef stock mix, tomato paste and 450ml<span class="text-purple"> [650ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water and stir it all together

Add half of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and a very generous crack of black pepper and bring to a boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min, stirring until fully combined

Once boiling, roughly break your spaghetti in half, add it to the pot and mix everything together

### Step 6

Once boiling, reduce to a medium-high heat, then top with the browned meatballs

Cook for an initial 8-10 min, stirring occasionally to prevent the spaghetti from sticking to the pot, or until cooked with a slight bite and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the spaghetti is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1683028172998-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the spaghetti is almost done, reduce the heat to medium and top with half of the grated cheese (save the rest for later!) and cook, covered, for a final 2 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your one-pot tomato spaghetti & lean meatballs

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot tomato spaghetti & lean meatballs with the remaining grated cheese sprinkled on top

Serve the salad to the side and top with a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper

Garnish with the remaining basil

Enjoy!
