### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Chop your ginger in half

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add your brown rice, tamari soy sauce and 650ml <span class="text-purple">[850ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L] </span>boiled water with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat
