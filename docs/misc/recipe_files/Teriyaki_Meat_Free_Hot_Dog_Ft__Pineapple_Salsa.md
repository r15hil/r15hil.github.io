### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your meat-free hot dog sausage[s] to a separate baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the sausages are browned all over

### Step 3

Remove your pineapple from the can (reserve the juice for later!) and chop roughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pineapple and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until lightly charred – this is your charred pineapple

### Step 4

Add your cornflour and reserved pineapple juice to a pot with your soy sauce and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> brown sugar

Cook for 3-4 min over a medium heat or until the sauce begins to thicken to a syrup-like consistency – this is your teriyaki sauce

### Step 5

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine the chopped tomato and charred pineapple with most of the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!), your white wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your pineapple salsa

### Step 6

Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun

Remove the sausage tray[s] from the oven

Add the cut hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the sausage tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the hot dog buns are warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1694168101452-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine your mayo and sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with a splash of cold water – this is your sriracha mayo

### Step 8

Fill each hot dog bun with a meat-free hot dog, then top with some of the pineapple salsa, teriyaki sauce, the reserved sliced spring onion and some of the sriracha mayo

Serve the chips, remaining sriracha mayo and the remaining pineapple salsa to the side

Enjoy!
