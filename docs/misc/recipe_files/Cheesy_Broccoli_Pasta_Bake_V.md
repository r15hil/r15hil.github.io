Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Reboil half a kettle

After the initial 4 min, add the broccoli florets to the pot with the pasta and cook for a further 4-5 min or until tender with a bite

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock

### Step 5

Once the shallot has softened, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk the creamy stock into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your white sauce

### Step 6

Once thick, stir through half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), soft cheese, ground paprika and Dijon mustard – this is your cheese sauce

Add the drained conchiglie & broccoli to the cheese sauce with a generous grind of black pepper and stir it all together

### Step 7

Transfer everything to an oven-proof dish and top with the remaining grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and bubbling

### Step 8

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!) – this is your cheesy broccoli pasta bake

Enjoy!
