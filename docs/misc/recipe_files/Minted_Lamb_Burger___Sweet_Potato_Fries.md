Put them in the oven for 35 min or until they're crispy and coloured

Meanwhile, peel and cut the red onion[s] in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a large drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar, then turn down to a low heat for 20 min or until the onion is soft and caramelised

Place the ciabattas in the oven to warm through for 5 min

### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the ground cumin, chopped onion, lamb mince and half of the chopped mint and half of the garlic in a bowl (you'll use the rest in the next step)

Season generously with salt and pepper

Mix together (clean hands works best) and form 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> patties, then refrigerate them until later

### Step 5

Cut the cucumber in half, lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away and grate the cucumber into a bowl

Add the remaining chopped mint, garlic and natural yoghurt and season lightly with salt and pepper, mix together and set aside

### Step 6

Remove the hot ciabattas from the oven and heat a wide-based pan over a medium-high heat

Slice the ciabattas in half and add them to the hot pan, cut-side down

Toast the rolls for 4 min or until slightly charred

Set the toasted ciabatta aside (keep the pan for the next step!)

### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties

Cook on each side for 4 min or until cooked through and nicely charred

Tip: press the patties down with a spatula to cook them evenly

### Step 8

Assemble your burgers with the caramelised onions and minty yoghurt

Serve the sweet potato fries to the side

Enjoy!
