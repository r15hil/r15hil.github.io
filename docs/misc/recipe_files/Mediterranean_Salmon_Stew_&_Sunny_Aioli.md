### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and 10g<span class="text-danger"> [20g]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, diced carrot and half of the garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of sugar

Meanwhile, chop the black olives coarsely

### Step 3

Combine the veg stock mix and half of the ground turmeric (save the rest for later!) with 350ml<span class="text-danger"> [700ml]</span> boiled water – this is your turmeric stock

Once the onion has softened, add the tomato paste and cook for 1 min, stirring continuously, then add the turmeric stock and chopped olives, and reduce the heat to low

Cook for 5 min or until reduced by half

### Step 4

Meanwhile, mix the remaining ground turmeric with 2-3 tsp of boiled water and stir until you have a smooth paste

Add the mayo, remaining chopped garlic, white wine vinegar and season with pepper, then whisk to combine

Add a drizzle of olive oil – this is your sunny aioli

### Step 6

Gently add the salmon fillets into the pan and cook, covered for 8-9 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

### Step 7

While the salmon is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Stir most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) carefully through the cooked stew – this is your Mediterranean salmon stew

### Step 8

Serve the Mediterranean salmon stew with the hot ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle over the sunny aioli

Don't forget to remove the star anise!

Enjoy!
