## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and set aside


### Step 4

Top, tail, and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your white cup mushrooms finely

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up & slice into thin strips


### Step 5

Add the grated carrot, sliced mushroom and sliced spring greens to the pan and cook for 4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg has softened


### Step 6

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated garlic, soy sauce and a splash of cold water in a small bowl – this is your gochujang stir-fry sauce


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the drained noodles with the gochujang stir-fry sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further, stirring until the sauce sticks to the noodles – this is your Korean-style chicken noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the Korean-style chicken noodle stir-fry

Garnish with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!
