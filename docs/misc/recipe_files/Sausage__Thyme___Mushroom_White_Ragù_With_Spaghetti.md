### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms finely into the pan with your hands

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Reboil half a kettle

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with your balsamic vinegar and a generous drizzle of olive oil and toss together – this is your balsamic salad

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water with your Chinese rice wine and soft cheese – this is your creamy stock

### Step 5

Once the sausage meat has begun to brown, add your roasted garlic paste with your dried thyme and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the creamy stock and a generous pinch of salt

Increase the heat to high and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sausage, thyme & mushroom white ragù

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1680165272127-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once thickened, add the drained spaghetti and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry – this is your sausage, thyme & mushroom white ragù with spaghetti

### Step 8

Serve the sausage, thyme & mushroom white ragù with spaghetti with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese sprinkled over the top

Serve the balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!
