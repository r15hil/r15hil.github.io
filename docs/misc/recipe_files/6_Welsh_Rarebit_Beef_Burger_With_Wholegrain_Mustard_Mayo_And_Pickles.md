### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, slice your cucumber finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and set aside to pickle – these are your pickles

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 3

Combine your beef mince in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!)

Meanwhile, melt a knob of butter in a pot over a medium heat

### Step 4

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Gradually whisk in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk, a little at a time, and cook for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once thickened, add the grated cheese with half your wholegrain mustard (you'll use the rest later!), Henderson's Relish and a pinch of pepper and cook for a further 2 min or until the cheese has melted, then remove the pan from the heat – this is your rarebit sauce

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min 

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!  

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Once browned, transfer the beef burger to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray and top with the rarebit sauce

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until the rarebit sauce is lightly browned and the burgers are cooked through – this is your Welsh rarebit burger

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1674558738078-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the burger is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through or until golden

Combine the remaining wholegrain mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!) and your mayo in a bowl – this is your wholegrain mustard mayo

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread the wholegrain mustard mayo over a ciabatta base, then top with the some of the pickles, a Welsh rarebit burger and a ciabatta lid

Serve with the chips and remaining pickles to the side

Enjoy!
