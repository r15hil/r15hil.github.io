### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Score the fatty side of your pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a generous pinch of salt and rub it into the criss-cross pattern

Add the scored pork belly, fat-side down, to the dish and cook for 2 min or until the fat is golden then flip over and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the pork belly to a plate and reduce the heat to medium

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your onion[s] into wedges

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-56-1725454348113-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add the onion wedges to the dish with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour, your tomato paste and half your white wine vinegar

Add your ground cumin, ground coriander, half your dried oregano and half your ground smoked paprika with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[475ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, your chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-56-1725454352371-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once boiling, return the pork belly to the dish, skin-side up

Put the dish in the oven and cook, uncovered, for an initial 30 min

Wash your salad, pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside

Once the pork has had 30 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped red pepper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-55-1725454355907-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the dish to the oven for a final 30 min or until thick and saucy and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy pork belly & smoky sauce

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and the remaining smoked paprika and dried oregano and mix everything together

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your wedges

### Step 8

Remove the crispy pork belly from the dish and cut into 3 slices per person

Drizzle the remaining white wine vinegar and a little olive oil over the salad

To serve, top the smoky sauce with the pork belly slices and the dressed salad and set the dish in the centre of the table with the wedges to the side

Dig in!
