## Ingredients

- Red onion
- Cheddar cheese (40g) x2
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Black beans (185g)
- Plain tortillas (4pcs)
- Coriander (5g)
- Avocado
- Lime
- Sweet pointed pepper x2
- Tomato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Deseed the Romano pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough pieces

Peel and finely slice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> red onion and finely dice the rest


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped peppers and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min, stirring frequently, or until softened and charred


### Step 3

Grate the cheddar cheese

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Once the vegetables are charred, drain and rinse the black beans

Remove the pan from the heat and add the drained black beans and smoked paprika to the charred peppers & onion and give everything a good mix up – this is your quesadilla filling


### Step 5

Divide the quesadilla filling and grated cheese between the large tortillas, covering only half of the wraps

Fold each tortilla over so you're left with 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> half moon-shaped sandwiches – these are your charred pepper, bean & cheese quesadillas


### Step 6

Add the charred pepper, bean & cheese quesadillas to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Place a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven for 12 min or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese is melted


### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and spoon into a bowl

Gently crush the avocado with a fork and season with a pinch of salt

Stir through the chopped red onion, tomato, coriander and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime – this is your chunky guacamole

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Cut each charred pepper, bean & cheese quesadilla into three

Serve the sliced quesadillas with the chunky guacamole and a wedge of lime to the side

Enjoy!
