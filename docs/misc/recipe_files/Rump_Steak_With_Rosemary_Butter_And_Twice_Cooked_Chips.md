### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thick chips

Add the thick chips to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 min, then drain and rinse with cold water to cool them slightly (save the pot!)

### Step 2

Meanwhile, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Add the par-boiled chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your twice cooked chips

### Step 3

Reserve one sprig of rosemary, then strip the remaining rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin[s]

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

### Step 4

Add the chopped rosemary, crushed garlic, onion marmalade, beef stock mix and crispy onions to a food processor with a generous knob of butter

Blitz until you are left with a smooth paste – this is your onion & rosemary butter

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 2-3 min or until they’re starting to soften

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

### Step 6

Once softened, add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 30 secs or until a sandy paste forms

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> milk, the wilted spinach, Dijon mustard and season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper

Cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your creamed leek and spinach

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

### Step 7

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once very hot, add the steak[s] to the pan with the reserved rosemary

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

### Step 8

Slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak with the onion & rosemary butter on top and the twice cooked chips and creamed leek and spinach to the side

Enjoy!
