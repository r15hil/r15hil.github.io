## Ingredients

- 50ml mayonnaise
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 20g chipotle paste
- 4 white potatoes
- 5g coriander
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season with cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), salt and pepper, then put in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 7-9 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, then stir in half of the chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Add the vegetable stock to the softened pepper and onion and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened slightly

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Drain the king prawns

Once the sauce has thickened slightly, add the king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has reduced to a thick stew – this is your pepper & prawn stew


### Step 6

Combine the mayo in a small bowl with the sliced spring onion, remaining chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of olive oil and half of the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of pepper and set aside – this is your smoky mayo


### Step 7

Once your potatoes are almost cooked, proceed with this step!

Heat another pan with a matching lid with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-low heat

Crack the eggs into a bowl, and once the pan is hot, add the eggs in one go

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the pepper & prawn stew

Serve the fried eggs over the stew with the crispy potatoes and smoky mayo to the side

Enjoy!
