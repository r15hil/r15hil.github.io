- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Spring onion
- White long grain rice (130g)
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- White long grain rice (65g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice half your brown onion[s]

Dice the remaining brown onion

Peel and finely slice (don't chop) your garlic


### Step 3

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine your cornflour, tamari soy sauce and rice vinegar in a small bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> cold water – this is your Filipino-style tocino sauce


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n and sliced onion to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the meat-free chick'n has lightly browned


### Step 5

Once the meat-free chick'n has lightly browned, turn the heat down to<span class="text-danger"> </span>medium-low, add the Filipino-style tocino sauce to the pan and cook for<span class="text-danger"> </span>3-4 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency – this is your Filipino-style sticky meat-free chick'n


### Step 6

Heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic to the pan with the cooled rice, vegetable stock mix and blanched peas

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once warmed through, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] onto the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your garlicky egg fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the Filipino-style sticky meat-free chick'n with the garlicky egg fried rice to the side

Spoon any Filipino-style tocino sauce over the top of the meat-free chick'n

Garnish with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
