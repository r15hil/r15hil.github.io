## Ingredients

- 200g pak choi
- 1 red chilli
- 1 toasted sesame oil sachet (15ml)
- 30ml soy sauce
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 130g basmati rice
- 2 x 150g British beef picanha rump steak
- 25g honey

## Instructions


### Step 1

<span class="text-highlight">Boil a kettle, then add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</span>


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked<br /><br />Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice the pak choi in half, lengthways 


Pat the rump steaks dry with kitchen towel, rub them with vegetable oil and season both sides with salt and pepper


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan over a high heat and once very hot, add the steaks 


<span class="text-highlight">For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side</span>


<span class="text-highlight">For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</span>


<span class="text-highlight">For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side</span>


Tip: don’t be tempted to move the steaks around too much in the pan – this will stop them from browning


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a separate pan with a matching lid over a medium heat


Once hot, add the <span class="text-highlight">toasted</span> sesame oil and pak choi, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly <span class="text-highlight">brown, then season with a pinch of salt</span>


Once brown, add a splash of boiled water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until soft 


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

Once done, transfer the cooked steaks to a shallow plate and leave them to rest 


Reserve the steak pan for later


### Step 6

Remove the steak pan from the heat, add the honey and soy sauce and give everything a good mix up


Tip: this will cool the pan down and prevent the honey from burning!


Return the pan to a medium-low heat and cook for 3-4 min or until a thick and sticky sauce remains – this is your teriyaki sauce


### Step 7

Slice the <span class="text-highlight">red</span> chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds


Slice the rested steaks finely


Stir any of the resting juices through the teriyaki sauce

### Step 8

Serve the sliced steak with the rice and sesame pak choi to the side


Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Pour the teriyaki sauce over everything and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and sliced chilli (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


Enjoy!
