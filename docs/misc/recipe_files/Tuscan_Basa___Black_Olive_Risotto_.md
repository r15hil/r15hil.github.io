- 125g cherry tomatoes 
- 160g arborio rice
- 11g vegetable stock mix 
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 30g pitted black olives
- 10g basil
- 15g capers
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and a pinch of salt

Cook for 5 min until softened but not coloured


### Step 4

Add the arborio rice and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to the pan, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add 1/3 of the stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until the stock is absorbed

Continue to add the stock, a little at a time, stirring continuously for 15-20 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and place them on the same tray

Drizzle everything with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper

Season the halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of sugar


### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min until the fish is cooked

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, chop the basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Chop the capers and black olives together finely

Combine both with the remaining chopped garlic

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your tapenade

### Step 8

Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and stir in a knob of butter and half of the tapenade – this is your black olive risotto

Stir in the roasted cherry tomatoes and most of the chopped basil

Serve the baked basa over the black olive risotto with the remaining tapenade spooned over and garnish with the reserved chopped basil

Enjoy!
