## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Slice your waxy potatoes in half, then add them to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your cumin seeds, curry powder, ground turmeric and ginger & garlic paste to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened slightly


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water over it until it's wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool enough to handle

Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 6

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Slice your red chilli[es] finely into rounds


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add them to the pan with your blanched peas and chopped spinach and cook for 2 min further until everything is coated in the sauce

Stir through your mango chutney – this is your saag aloo with peas

Slice the warmed pitta[s] in half

### Step 8

Serve the saag aloo with peas in a bowl with the halved pitta to the side

Garnish with your nigella seeds and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
