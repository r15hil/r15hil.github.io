## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, then boil half a kettle

Squeeze your pouch[es] of the cooked white long grain rice, making sure to separate the grains

Once hot, remove the pan off the heat and add your ginger & garlic paste and cooked white long grain rice to the pan and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Return the pan back to the heat and sprinkle your ground turmeric and vegetable stock mix into the pan

Pour in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water and mix it all together


### Step 4

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach and half your chilli flakes to the pan (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 5

Give everything a good mix up, then sit your smoked basa fillet[s] over the rice and cook, covered, for an initial 4-5 min


### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 7

After an initial 4-5 min, break the basa into chunks in the pan with a wooden spoon, stir it through the rice and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, add the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and stir it all together until fully combined – this is your smoked basa & spinach pilau rice

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa & spinach pilau rice with the sliced spring onion sprinkled over the top

Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lemon wedge

Season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!
