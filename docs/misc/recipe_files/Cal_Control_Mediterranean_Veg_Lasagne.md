## Ingredients

- Red pepper
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Mediterranean-style seasoning (3g) (3g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Lasagne sheets (120g)
- Green lentils (390g) x1
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Garlic clove
- Courgette
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Top, tail and peel lengths of your courgette[s] into ribbons

Chop the remaining courgette core into rough bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until the peppers are starting to brown slightly and caramelise

Once caramelised, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water

Add your Mediterranean style seasoning, half your balsamic vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir it all together – this is your Mediterranean stock

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have caramelised, add the Mediterranean stock, drained lentils, courgette core and your chopped tomatoes to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a pasta sauce-like consistency – this is your Mediterranean veg sauce


### Step 6

Combine your grated Italian hard cheese with your cornflour and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a pot and mix until the cheese is fully coated

Add 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> milk to the pot and stir it all together

Cook over a medium heat for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and thickened – this is your béchamel


### Step 7

Layer some of the Mediterranean veg sauce over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets and courgette ribbons and repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of courgette ribbons

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish

Cover with the béchamel and cook in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked – this is your Mediterranean veg lasagne

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Once done, remove the Mediterranean veg lasagne from the oven and leave to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle over the remaining balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil

Enjoy!
