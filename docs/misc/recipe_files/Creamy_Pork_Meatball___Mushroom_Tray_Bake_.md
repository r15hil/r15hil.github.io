### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then cut your potato[es] (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely dice half your red onion[s] and cut the remaining onion into wedges

Cut your pepper[s] into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons

### Step 2

Chop most of your parsley finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with your panko breadcrumbs, diced onion, ground cumin, half your ground smoked paprika, half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Divide the mix and shape into 3 meatballs per person

### Step 3

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and boil half a kettle

### Step 4

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until starting to soften

After 10 min, add the pork meatballs to the baking tray[s], then return the tray[s] to the oven for 20-25 min further or until the meatballs are browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, slice your chestnut mushrooms

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3–4 min or until the mushrooms have slightly softened

### Step 7

Once softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until almost all of the liquid is absorbed

Add the chicken stock and cook for 3-4 min further or until reduced slightly

Once reduced, stir in your soft cheese, remaining chopped parsley and a good grind of black pepper then remove from the heat – this is your creamy mushroom sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cooked pork meatballs over the roasted vegetables and pour the creamy mushroom sauce all over – this is your creamy pork meatball & mushroom traybake

Garnish with the reserved parsley leaves

Enjoy!
