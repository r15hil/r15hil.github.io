## Ingredients

- Spinach (120g)
- Spinach (80g) x0
- Tortiglioni (200g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Smoked mackerel fillet
- Garlic clove x2
- Red chilli
- Shallot
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

Peel and slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Cut your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Peel the skin off your smoked mackerel fillet[s] and discard

Tear the smoked mackerel into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Once the tortiglioni is almost done, reboil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until softened


### Step 5

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out as possible and chop roughly


### Step 6

Add the chopped spinach and smoked mackerel pieces to the pan with the drained tortiglioni and a big splash of the starchy pasta water, then cook for 1-2 min until the fish is warmed through

Add your crème fraîche and the juice of half your lemon[s] to the pan with your vegetable stock mix and grated Italian hard cheese


### Step 7

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully combined and the sauce begins to stick to the tortiglioni – this is your creamy smoked mackerel tortiglioni with chilli & lemon

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the creamy smoked mackerel tortiglioni with chilli & lemon

Top with a very generous grind of black pepper

Serve with a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
