## Description

This risotto appears humble, but has a touch of magic. Fresh rosemary and sharp balsamic brings a piney flavour, counterbalanced by the natural parsnip sweetness. There are cumin seeds for earthiness and spice. Comforting yet sophisticated.

## Ingredients

- 160g traditional arborio rice
- 5g fresh rosemary
- 2 tbsp Italian balsamic vinegar
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 40g Italian hard cheese
- 1 tsp whole cumin seeds
- 1 onion
- 300g parsnips

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 160&deg;C/ 140&deg;C (fan)/ 325&deg;F/ Gas 3


### Step 2

Peel&nbsp;and finely chop the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Strip the rosemary leaves from their stalks and chop finely


Grate the Italian hard&nbsp;cheese


### Step 3

Peel the parsnips


Continue to peel lengths off&nbsp;the parsnip until you end up with a pile of parsnip 'ribbons'


Once you can't peel any further, chop the remaining parsnip&nbsp;core&nbsp;into bite-size&nbsp;chunks


### Step 4

Add the parsnip ribbons, cumin seeds and a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil to a bowl and give it a good old mix up


Line a baking&nbsp;tray with some baking paper and&nbsp;add the parsnip ribbons


Tip: make sure they don't overlap as they won't crisp properly


### Step 5

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the parsnip ribbons are browned at the edges


Once done, remove the tray from the oven and place them on a piece of kitchen paper to cool - these are your parsnip crisps


Season&nbsp;generously with salt


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable&nbsp;stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 750ml <span class="text-danger">[1.5L]&nbsp;</span>boiled water


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a large knob of butter&nbsp;over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the parsnip chunks&nbsp;and&nbsp;chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until the parsnip has coloured slightly


### Step 7

Add the arborio rice and&nbsp;chopped rosemary to the pan and stir through for 2 min


Add&nbsp;1/3&nbsp;of the stock to the rice and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until the stock is absorbed


Continue to add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20-25 min&nbsp;or until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 8

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the grated cheese


Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed


Serve&nbsp;and garnish with the parsnip crisps and drizzle with balsamic vinegar


Enjoy!
