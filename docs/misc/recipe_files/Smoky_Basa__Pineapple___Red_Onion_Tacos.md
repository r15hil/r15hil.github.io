### Step 1

Peel your red onion[s] and slice into rings, 1 per person, then dice the remaining onion

Add the onion rings and red wine vinegar to a shallow bowl and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled onion rings

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic to the softened onion and cook for 1 min further, then set aside until serving

### Step 3

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and separate the outer leaves, then finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain and finely dice your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa

### Step 4

Chop your coriander as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and the chopped coriander in a bowl – this is your herby mayo

### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to a bowl with your soy sauce, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix until the basa is evenly coated – this is your coated basa

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1643619002346-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Drain the quick-pickled onion rings and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Top your warmed tortillas with a dollop of herby mayo and the lettuce leaves

Fill the lettuce leaves with the softened onion, top with smoky basa, pineapple salsa and garnish with the quick-pickled onion rings – these are your smoky basa, pineapple & red onion tacos

Enjoy!
