Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

### Step 5

Whilst the orzo is cooking, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop it roughly

Tear your basil leaves

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Add the chopped spinach and halved tomatoes to the orzo with half the torn basil (save the rest for later!) and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, give everything a good mix up – this is your spinach & tomato orzo

### Step 7

Meanwhile, season your hake fillet[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper

Lay the seasoned hake over the spinach & tomato orzo, top with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the hake is cooked through – this is your one-pot creamy hake florentine

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily!

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot creamy hake florentine and garnish with the remaining torn basil

Enjoy!
