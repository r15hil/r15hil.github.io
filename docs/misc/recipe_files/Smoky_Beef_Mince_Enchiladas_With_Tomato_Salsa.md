### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your beef mince, ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan, increase the heat to high and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 5

Add the tomato stock and cook for 4 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky beef mince filling

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little olive oil

### Step 6

Once thickened, divide the smoky beef mince filling between the tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and place into the greased oven-proof dish

Top with the grated cheese and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until the tortillas are beginning to crisp and the cheese has melted – these are your smoky beef mince enchiladas

### Step 7

While the enchiladas are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then stir it all together – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 8

Serve the smoky beef mince enchiladas topped with the tomato salsa

Enjoy!
