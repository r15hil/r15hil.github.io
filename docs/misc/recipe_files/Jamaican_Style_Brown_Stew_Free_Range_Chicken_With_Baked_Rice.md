## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs to the dish and cook for 3 min or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into thirds

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, then crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped onion and pepper to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and mix it all together

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and sliced spring onion with the chopped chilli, crushed garlic, ground allspice, dried thyme, tomato paste, soy sauce, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> brown sugar and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Jamaican-style brown stew free range chicken


### Step 7

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 8

Serve the Jamaican-style brown stew free range chicken with the baked rice to the side

Tear your coriander all over

Dig in!
