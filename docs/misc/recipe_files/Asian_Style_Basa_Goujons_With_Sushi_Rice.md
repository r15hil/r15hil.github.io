### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under running cold water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> [400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min, then remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine your white miso paste and half of your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), then mix together until you have a loose paste – this is your miso marinade

Cut your basa fillet[s] into quarters and add to the miso marinade

Give everything a good mix up until the fish is fully coated, then set aside for later – this is your miso basa

### Step 3

While the fish is marinating, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Add your cornflour to a plate and coat the miso basa in the cornflour, pressing firmly to coat the fish evenly and set aside

Tip: Coat the basa in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!

### Step 5

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Add the diced shallot to a small bowl with your mayo, ginger paste, half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for later!) and a splash of cold water to loosen the sauce

Season with a crack of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your ginger & coriander mayo

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 4 min on each side until golden, crisp and cooked through – these are your Asian-style basa goujons

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the sliced spring onion to a bowl with the edamame beans, tamari soy sauce, remaining rice vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Add the remaining chopped coriander to the edamame beans and mix everything together – this is your edamame salad

### Step 8

Serve the sushi rice with the edamame salad, Asian-style basa goujons and ginger & coriander mayo to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
