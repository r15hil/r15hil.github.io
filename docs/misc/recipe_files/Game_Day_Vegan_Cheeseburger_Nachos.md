### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Stack the tortillas, and slice into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, then remove from the oven

### Step 2

While the tortilla is in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the ultimate vegan burger patties to the pan breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go (as you would mince)

Cook for 3-4 min or until starting to crisp

Once the vegan mince is beginning to crisp, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further
