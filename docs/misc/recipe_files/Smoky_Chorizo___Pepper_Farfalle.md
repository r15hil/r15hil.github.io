- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your diced chorizo to a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp

Once crispy, transfer to a small bowl and reserve the pan


### Step 3

While the chorizo is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 8-9 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 5

Dissolve your soft cheese and chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy chicken stock

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Once the pepper is soft, add the sliced garlic, your ground smoked paprika and a small pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the drained farfalle, creamy chicken stock and crispy chorizo to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the farfalle is evenly coated in the sauce – this is your smoky chorizo & pepper farfalle

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the smoky chorizo & pepper farfalle

Top with the grated cheese

Enjoy!
