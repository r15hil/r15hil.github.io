## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, wash your shredded spring greens then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the shredded spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to wilt


### Step 4

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Add the pepper strips, chopped ginger, chopped garlic and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has softened


### Step 5

Once softened, drain, then add your king prawns to the pan and cook for an initial 2-3 min


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce, honey, white miso paste, toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar in a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your honey miso sauce


### Step 7

Add the honey miso sauce to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min, stirring until everything is coated, the sauce is slightly sticky and the prawns are cooked through – these are your honey miso king prawns & chilli veg

### Step 8

Serve the brown rice in bowls with the honey miso king prawns & chilli veg to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
