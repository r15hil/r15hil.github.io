## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season with cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), salt and pepper, then put in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and slice your brown onion[s] finely

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar, then cook for 7-9 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, then stir in half of your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Add your vegetable stock and drained cannellini beans to the softened pepper and onion and cook for 10-15 min over a low heat or until reduced to a thick stew


### Step 5

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Combine your mayo in a small bowl with the sliced spring onion, remaining chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of olive oil and half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!)

Season with a pinch of pepper and set aside – this is your smoky mayo


### Step 7

Once your potatoes are almost cooked, heat another pan with a matching lid with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-low heat

Crack your egg[s] into a bowl, and once the pan is hot, add the eggs in one go

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the stew, then top with the fried eggs – this is your tapas-style pepper, bean & egg stew

Serve the tapas-style pepper, bean & egg stew with the crispy potatoes and smoky mayo to the side

Enjoy!
