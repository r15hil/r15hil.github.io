### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, and chop your green beans in half

Drain and rinse your butter beans

### Step 3

Add the chopped green beans and butter beans to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite

Once tender, drain and set aside until serving – this is your bean mix

### Step 4

Peel your garlic and add it to a food processor with half your cherry tomatoes (you'll use the rest later!), your sun-dried tomatoes, agave, red wine vinegar, a generous pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz until well combined and smooth – this is your sun-dried tomato dressing

### Step 5

Chop the remaining cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways and remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon

Peel away the skin, then cut in half again – these are your avocado quarters

### Step 6

Combine your toasted sesame seeds and dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt on a plate – this is your sesame chilli mix

Add the avocado quarters to the sesame chilli mix and press gently until well coated – this is your sesame chilli avo

Reserve any remaining sesame chilli mix

### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Combine the shredded lettuce and bean mix in a large bowl with the chopped cherry tomatoes and the sun-dried tomato dressing

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your sun-dried tomato bean salad

### Step 8

Serve the sun-dried tomato bean salad in bowls

Top it with the sesame chilli avo and sprinkle over any remaining sesame chilli mix

Enjoy!
