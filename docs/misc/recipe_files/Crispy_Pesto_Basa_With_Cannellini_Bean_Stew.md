### Step 3

Meanwhile, mix your panko breadcrumbs with your pesto and a drizzle of olive oil - this is your pesto panko

Add your basa fillet[s] to a tin foiled-lined baking tray (or two!) and coat evenly with the pesto panko

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the fish is golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Add the drained cannellini beans and vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 5-7 min or until the cherry tomatoes start to burst and the liquid has reduced slightly

### Step 7

Meanwhile, finely chop your basil, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Once reduced, add the chopped basil to the cannellini beans – this is your cannellini bean stew

### Step 8

Serve the pesto crusted basa fillet[s] over the cannellini bean stew

Garnish with the reserved basil leaves and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
