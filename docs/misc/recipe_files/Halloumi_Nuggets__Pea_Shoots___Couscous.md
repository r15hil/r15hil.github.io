## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Slice the halloumi in half lengthways (where the natural crease forms)


Cut each half into 3 even strips (see picture)


### Step 2

Add a handful of flour to a plate


Crack&nbsp;the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork&nbsp;


Add&nbsp;the panko&nbsp;breadcrumbs and smoked&nbsp;paprika to a separate shallow bowl and mix to combine


Dip the halloumi&nbsp;in the flour, tap off the excess, then into the egg and finally press it into the breadcrumbs


### Step 3

Strip the mint leaves from the stalks and chop them&nbsp;finely


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with 4 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil


Once hot, add the&nbsp;halloumi nuggets and cook for 1-2 min per side or until golden brown and crispy&nbsp;


Once cooked, transfer to kitchen paper&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> on a hard surface (to release more juice) then cut in half


Mix together the mayonnaise, mint, juice from the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil - this is your dressing


### Step 6
