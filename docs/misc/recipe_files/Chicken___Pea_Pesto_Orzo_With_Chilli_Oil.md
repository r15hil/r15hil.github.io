## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Grate your Italian hard cheese finely

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a food processor and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 3

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 4

Add the wilted spinach to the food processor with a third of your blanched peas (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your basil, peeled garlic and your grated Italian hard cheese

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water with a pinch of salt, then blitz until well combined and smooth – this is your pea & basil pesto

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then once hot, add your chicken breast strips and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high and add your orzo to the pan and mix everything together until the grains are fully coated in the remaining oil

Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for an initial 12-15 min, stirring continuously, or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite, and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the orzo is cooking, combine your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your chilli oil


### Step 7

Once the orzo and chicken are cooked, add the pea & basil pesto and remaining blanched peas to the pan

Stir it all together and cook for a final 1-2 min until everything is warmed through – this is your chicken & pea pesto orzo


### Step 8

Serve the chicken & pea pesto orzo

Drizzle over the chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)
