### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut, lengthways into wedges

Once hot, add the aubergine wedges to the dish and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Slice your red chilli[es] in half lengthways

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Roughly chop your creamed coconut (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 4

Add the onion wedges and half your red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour, coconut stock, tamarind paste, ginger & garlic paste, soy sauce, red Thai curry paste, ground turmeric and vegetable stock mix to the aubergine

Give everything a good mix up then cover with a lid and put it in the oven for 30 min or until the aubergine is tender – this is your baked Indonesian-style aubergine yellow curry

### Step 5

Once the curry is in the oven, add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

When the curry has about 15 min left, trim your green beans

Roughly chop the remaining red chilli

### Step 7

Add the trimmed green beans and chopped red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a drizzle of vegetable oil, then scrunch the foil to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite – these are your chilli green beans

### Step 8

To serve, pair the baked Indonesian-style aubergine yellow curry with the baked rice and chilli green beans to the side

Garnish the green beans with your crispy onions

Dig in!
