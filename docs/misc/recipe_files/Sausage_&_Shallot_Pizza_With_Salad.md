### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom[s] from going soggy)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and breaking it up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and cook for 5-7 min or until crispy and nearly cooked through

Add 5 tbsp<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [7 1/2 tbsp]</span> [10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Top the pizzas with the torn mozzarella, sausage meat and sliced shallot

Sprinkle over your dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)
