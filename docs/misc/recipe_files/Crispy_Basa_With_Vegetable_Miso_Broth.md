## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Set the carrot ribbons aside


### Step 2

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return them to the pot until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then roughly chop


### Step 4

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Heat a large pot, (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min

Add 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water with your miso paste, vegetable stock mix and soy sauce and give everything a good mix until fully combined

Reduce the heat to low – this is your miso broth


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your ground smoked paprika, cornflour and a pinch of salt on a plate

Cut your basa fillet[s] in half, add them to the cornflour mix and turn them until evenly coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the chopped spinach and carrot ribbons to the miso broth with half the spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 2 min or until tender with a slight bite – this is your vegetable miso broth

### Step 8

Serve the wholewheat noodles, pour over the vegetable miso broth and top with the crispy basa

Garnish with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining spring onion

Enjoy!
