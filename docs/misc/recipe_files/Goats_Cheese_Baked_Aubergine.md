## Ingredients

- 2 tomatoes
- 150g bulgur wheat
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 30g panko breadcrumbs 
- 100g Rosary garlic & herb goats' cheese
- 1 aubergine 
- 1 tsp dried dill
- 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Slice your aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;lengthways into 4 equally thick slices, discard the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Season both sides with salt


### Step 2

Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot,&nbsp;add the aubergine and cook, covered, for 3-4 min each side or until nicely browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your tomatoes in half and season them lightly with salt and pepper


Transfer the coloured aubergine to the baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Reserve the pan for later


### Step 4

Add the bulgur to a pot with plenty of salted boiled water over a high heat


Cook for 10-12 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


Meanwhile, mix the pomegranate molasses and the honey together - this is your glaze


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add the tomatoes, cut-side-down


Cover and cook for 3-4 min or until nicely charred and blackened in colour


### Step 6

Spread the glaze evenly&nbsp;over the cooked aubergine then top with the breadcrumbs


Tip: Working one at a time prevents the glaze from running off the aubergine and the breadcrumbs will help hold it in place


Place the baking tray on the top rack of your oven and cook for 5-7 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden brown in colour


### Step 7

Stir the dill, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper through the drained bulgur


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the crispy glazed aubergine over the bulgur, crumble the Rosary goats' cheese over and serve the tomatoes alongside


Enjoy!
