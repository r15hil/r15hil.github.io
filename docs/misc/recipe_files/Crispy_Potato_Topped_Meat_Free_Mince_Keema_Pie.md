Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Wash your spinach, pat dry with kitchen paper, then add to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min, stirring continuously, until the spinach has wilted

Add your blanched peas and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your meat-free mince keema

### Step 7

Transfer the meat-free mince keema to an oven-proof dish and top it with the turmeric potatoes

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – this is your crispy potato-topped meat-free mince keema pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Allow the crispy potato-topped meat-free mince keema pie to cool slightly before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)
