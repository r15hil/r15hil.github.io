## Ingredients

- 30g pine nut & seed mix
- 160g arborio rice
- 32g tomato paste
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 40g cheddar flavour block
- 25g chilli jam
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 5g chives
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until roasted and golden – these are your roasted peppers


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water, then add the tomato paste, Chinese rice wine and chilli jam – this is your sweet tomato stock


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter alternative over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min until softened but not browned

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Once softened, add the arborio rice, chopped garlic, smoked paprika and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min further


### Step 5

Add 1/3 of the sweet tomato stock and stir continuously until absorbed

Continue to add the remaining sweet tomato stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the chives finely

Grate the cheddar flavour block


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the roasted peppers from the oven

Stir half of the roasted peppers into the risotto (save the rest for garnish!)

Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in half of the grated cheddar flavour block and half of the chopped chives, then season with a grind of black pepper – this is your sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto

### Step 8

To serve, top the sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto with the reserved roasted peppers, remaining grated cheddar flavour block and the pine nut & seed mix

Garnish with the reserved chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
