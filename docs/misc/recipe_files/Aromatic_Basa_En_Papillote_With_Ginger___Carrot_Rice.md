## Ingredients

- 2 dried lime leaves
- 1 red chilli
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 15ml soy sauce
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 1 carrot
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk
- 80g spinach
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and chop the softer inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Slice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> red chilli into rounds and finely chop the remaining


### Step 2

Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine the Chinese rice wine and soy sauce in a small bowl with the toasted sesame oil, the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and a splash of cold water – this is your marinade


### Step 3

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of baking paper approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper

Add 1 lime leaf and half the chopped lemongrass to the middle of each piece of paper and top with the basa fillets

Top the basa with half the chopped ginger, the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and lime zest

Divide the marinade evenly over each basa fillet, then scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the basa to form a sealed parcel


### Step 4

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 15 min or until they have softened and caramelised


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water, a pinch of salt and the remaining chopped ginger and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat, add the carrot ribbons and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your ginger & carrot rice


### Step 6

Add the basa parcels to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through – this is your aromatic basa en papillote

Whilst the basa is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the onion has caramelised, increase the heat to medium-high, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add a small splash of water and the spinach with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further or until wilted – this is your caramelised onion spinach

### Step 8

Serve the aromatic basa en papillote with the ginger & carrot rice and caramelised onion spinach to the side

Drizzle over any remaining sauce from the parcels and garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
