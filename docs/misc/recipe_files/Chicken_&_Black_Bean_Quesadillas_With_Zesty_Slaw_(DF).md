### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans

### Step 2

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium, add the drained black beans, soy sauce and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> warm water

Add the smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further

Cover with a lid and cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is fully cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, grate the cheddar flavour block

### Step 4

Once the chicken is done, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mash the cooked black beans until smooth – these are your refried beans

### Step 5

Add the grated cheddar flavour block and pulled chicken to the refried beans and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken & black bean mix

Divide the chicken & black bean mix between the tortillas

Fold each tortilla over so you're left with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> half moon-shaped sandwiches

### Step 6

Add the folded tortillas to a baking tray

Place a second baking tray on top of the tortilla baking tray to weigh it down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 15 min or until the tortillas are slightly browned and the cheeze is melted – these are your chicken & black bean quesadillas

### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash, trim and finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then slice the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Combine the grated carrot, grated apple, sliced spring onion, a good squeeze of lime and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your zesty slaw

Combine the mayo and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 8

Once done, leave the chicken & black bean quesadillas to cool slightly and the cheeze to set

Once cooled, slice the chicken & black bean quesadillas into triangles

Serve the zesty slaw and the chipotle mayo to the side

Enjoy!
