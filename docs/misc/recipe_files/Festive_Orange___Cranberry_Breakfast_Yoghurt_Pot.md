## Instructions


### Step 1

Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Busy morning ahead? Some of this recipe can be prepped ahead (if you like!)

Make steps 2-5 the night before and finish the rest in the morning!

Cover and store in the fridge, ready to finish in the morning and enjoy within 24 hours

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started

Combine your ground cinnamon with 3 tsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl – this is your cinnamon sugar


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds, pecan nuts and walnuts to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a bowl and set aside – these are your toasted nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 4

Cut the top and bottom off your orange[s], then carefully cut the skin away from the flesh and discard the skin

Chop the orange flesh into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

To build your yoghurt pot, add a layer of your natural yoghurt to the bottom of your bowls and top with some of your plum chutney, some of the chopped orange, your dried cranberries, a handful of toasted nuts and a sprinkle of the remaining cinnamon sugar

Repeat the layering until your yoghurt pots are full, then top with your honey – these are your festive orange & cranberry yoghurt pot[s]

Tip: Whip this up the night before! Refrigerate and enjoy within 24 hours for a ready to go breakfast


### Step 6

Place your brioche halves in the toaster for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted through


### Step 7

Spread your peanut butter on the toasted brioche halves, then sprinkle with some of the cinnamon sugar (you'll use the rest later!) – these are your cinnamon peanut butter toasts

### Step 8

Slice your cinnamon peanut butter toasts in half

Serve your festive orange & cranberry yoghurt pot[s] with the halved cinnamon peanut butter toasts to the side

Time to start your day!
