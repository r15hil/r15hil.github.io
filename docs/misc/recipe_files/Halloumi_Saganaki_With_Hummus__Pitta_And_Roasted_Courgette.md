Saganaki is named after the small frying pan used to crisp it up to perfection. You’ll sizzle halloumi until it's golden brown before serving it up meze-style with creamy homemade hummus, roasted courgette and tomato, sourdough pita and peppery rocket.

## Ingredients

- Lemon
- Rocket (20g)
- Sourdough pittas (2pcs)
- Tahini (15g)
- Tomato
- Courgette
- Chickpeas (185g)
- Halloumi (200g)
- Honey (25g)
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs on the diagonal

Chop half your garlic finely

Crush your remaining garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges


### Step 2

Add the chopped courgette to a baking paper-lined baking tray with the chopped garlic, tomato wedges and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and golden – this is your roasted veg


### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain your chickpeas

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface and cut in half

Add 2/3 of the drained chickpeas to a food processor with your tahini, peeled garlic and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>salt

Add 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 1/2 tbsp] </span>olive oil with the juice of half the lemon[s], 30ml <span class="text-purple">[50ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[80ml] </span>cold water and a generous grind of pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your hummus


### Step 4

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Slice your halloumi (3 slices per person!)

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Add the sliced halloumi to the plate and turn several times until fully coated in the flour


### Step 5

When the roasted veg has 10 min left, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crispy


### Step 6

Once crispy, add your honey to the pan with a crack of black pepper

Mix it all together and cook for a further 30 secs or until the halloumi is golden and sticky – this is your halloumi saganaki

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Do this is in batches

When everything's nearly ready, add your sourdough pitta to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once ready, remove the roasted veg from the oven and squash the tomato wedges with the back of a spoon

Add the reserved drained chickpeas

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted veg mix

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Chop the warmed sourdough pitta into quarters

Serve the hummus on a plate with the roasted veg mix, halloumi saganaki, salad and pitta quarters to the side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper to the hummus and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
