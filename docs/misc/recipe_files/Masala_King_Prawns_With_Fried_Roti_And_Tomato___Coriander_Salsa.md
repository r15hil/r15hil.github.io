## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Chop your tomatoes roughly

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, stir through the chopped creamed coconut with 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[195ml] </span>[275ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt

Drain, then add your king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your masala king prawns


### Step 6

Add the juice of half your lime[s] to a bowl with the chopped tomato and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato & coriander salsa


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your roti and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden – this is your fried roti

Tip: You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the masala king prawns and tomato & coriander salsa on top of the fried roti

Garnish with a lime wedge and the reserved chopped coriander

Enjoy!
