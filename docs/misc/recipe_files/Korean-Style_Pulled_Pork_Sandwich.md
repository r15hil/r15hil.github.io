### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish, draining away half of the juices

Top with your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, then cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min

### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with your toasted sesame oil and a pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are crisp and cooked through

Once cooked, sprinkle over your black sesame seeds – these are your sesame roasted potatoes

### Step 3

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

### Step 4

Add your shredded red cabbage and bashed cucumber to a large bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your soy sauce and half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled salad

### Step 5

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add the sliced spring onion to a bowl along with your ginger & garlic paste and your mayo

Add the remaining rice vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a grind of black pepper then mix well – this is your spring onion & ginger mayo

### Step 6

After an initial 30 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the pork apart using two forks and mix everything through the juices

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed and the pork has started to crisp – this is your Korean-style pulled pork

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1656238149142-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down

Cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

### Step 8

Sandwich the Korean-style pulled pork, some spring onion & ginger mayo and a little quick-pickled salad between the toasted brioche halves

Serve the sesame roasted potatoes, remaining quick-pickled salad and remaining spring onion & ginger mayo to the side

Enjoy!
