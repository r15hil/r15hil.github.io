## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s], garlic and ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a pot with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until sizzling

Once the cumin seeds start to sizzle, carefully add your basmati rice and stir it all together


### Step 3

Add your ground turmeric and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your turmeric rice


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your ground cumin, curry powder and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your tomato paste and stir it all together

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if the pan looks a little dry


### Step 6

Add your tamarind paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce is beginning to thicken

Increase the heat to high and add the chopped hake, once boiling, reduce heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your hake pathia

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the fish is almost cooked, add your mini garlic & coriander naans to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the warmed naans once they are out of the toaster

Meanwhile, chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the hake pathia with the turmeric rice and warmed naans to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
