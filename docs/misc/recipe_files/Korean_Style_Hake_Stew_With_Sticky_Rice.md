## Ingredients

- 150g sushi rice
- 8ml fish sauce
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 tsp cornflour
- 30g gochujang paste
- 2 hake fillets
- 0 sushi rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 carrot
- 125g radishes
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can!)

Add the sliced radishes to a small bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled radish


### Step 4

Trim and slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 5

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Dissolve your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water with your fish sauce, cornflour and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your gochujang stock


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the sliced carrot and gochujang stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 4-5 min until the carrots are almost tender – this is your Korean-style stew


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

When the rice is almost done, add the chopped hake to the Korean-style stew and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Korean-style hake stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Korean-style hake stew with the sticky rice and quick-pickled radish to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
