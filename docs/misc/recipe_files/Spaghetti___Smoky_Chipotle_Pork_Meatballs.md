## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and carrot[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Separate your coriander leaves from their stems, then finely chop the stems (save the leaves for garnish!)

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!), chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander stems to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix well until fully combined, then divide the mixture into 3 per person and shape them into meatballs

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned


### Step 3

While the meatballs are browning, add the chopped onion, carrot and red pepper to a food processor and blitz until smooth

Boil a full kettle


### Step 4

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Return the pan and any remaining oil to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the blitzed vegetables, halved cherry tomatoes, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti


### Step 6

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Once the vegetables have softened, add the tomato stock to the pan

Return the meatballs to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 12-15 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your smoky chipotle pork meatballs


### Step 7

While everything's cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 8

Serve the smoky chipotle pork meatballs over the drained spaghetti

Top with the grated cheese and coriander leaves

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
