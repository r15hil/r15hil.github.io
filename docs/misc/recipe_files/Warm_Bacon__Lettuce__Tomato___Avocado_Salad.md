## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Drizzle them with olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then chop in half widthways

Shred the bottom half of the lettuce finely

Separate the remaining lettuce leaves, keeping them whole

Roughly chop your cherry tomatoes

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]


### Step 4

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and roughly chop


### Step 5

After an initial 10 min, add your smoked streaky bacon to the tray with the potatoes

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 20-25 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and the bacon is crisp


### Step 6

Combine your wholegrain mustard, white wine vinegar and mayo in a bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water – this is your mustard dressing


### Step 7

Add half the mustard dressing (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

Drizzle with the remaining mustard dressing
