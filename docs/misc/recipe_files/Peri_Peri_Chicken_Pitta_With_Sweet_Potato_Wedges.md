## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Peel and slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 3

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] in half across the middle – these are your chicken pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 4

Combine your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) on a plate

Add the juice from your lemon[s], your soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and mix to form a paste – this is your peri peri paste

Add the chicken pieces to the paste and mix until fully coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 5

Once the onion has caramelised, push to one side of the pan and increase the heat to high

Add the coated chicken to the other side of the pan and cook for 5 min on each side until golden, then cover with a lid and cook for a further 6-8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, wash and shred your lettuce finely, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Slice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds


### Step 7

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the tray[s] with the sweet potato wedges and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Cut the warmed pitta in half and spread the inside of each half with a dollop of natural yoghurt, then stuff with the peri peri chicken, caramelised onions, shredded lettuce and tomato rounds – this is your is your peri peri chicken pitta

Serve the peri peri chicken pitta with the sweet potato wedges and any remaining shredded lettuce and tomato rounds to the side

Enjoy!
