### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined tray with your smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries

### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Combine your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl with the sliced onion and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>boiled water – this is your quick-pickled onion

### Step 3

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it very finely

### Step 4

Combine your tomato ketchup, mayo and chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your spicy burger sauce

### Step 5

Once the fries have been cooking for 15 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ultimate vegan burger patty[ies] and cook for 7-9 min or until cooked through and slightly crisp, breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go

Season with a generous grind of pepper – this is your meat-free mince

### Step 6

Once the mince is cooked through and slightly crisp, gently push the meat-free mince into the centre of pan

Tear your cheese flavour slices into pieces

Top the meat-free mince with the torn cheeze and cook, covered, for a final 1-2 min or until the cheeze has melted – this is your cheezy mince

### Step 7

Add the tortillas to a baking tray

Put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

Drain the quick-pickled onion and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Load each warmed tortilla with a dollop of spicy burger sauce, (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) some shredded lettuce and chopped tomato

Top with a handful of smoky fries, cheezy mince and quick-pickled onion – these are your plant-based cheezeburger x tacos

Serve any remaining spicy burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!
