### Step 4

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half lengthways


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add the pizza bases

Divide the tomato base between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Dollop the creamy base over the pizza bases and lightly swirl into the tomato base


### Step 6

Top the bases with the torn mozzarella

Tear over your ‘Nduja (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Top with the chopped Tenderstem broccoli and add a small drizzle of olive oil

Once the pizzas are cooked, remove from the oven – these are your creamy ‘Nduja & broccoli pizzas
