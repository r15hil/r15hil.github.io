## Ingredients

- British rump pavé steak (150g) x0
- British rump pavé steak (300g)
- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Soured cream (80g)
- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp) x1
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- Chives (5g)
- Gem lettuce
- Garlic clove
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Brown onion
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Peel and grate your garlic


### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your ground smoked paprika, ground coriander and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky chips


### Step 3

Chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives in a bowl with your soured cream, the juice of half your lemon[s], the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your soured cream & chive dip


### Step 4

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into discs (roughly 0.5cm thick)

Tip: Pop out the centres so that you have different sized discs!

Add the onion discs to a bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up so they are well coated – these are your floured onions

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred


### Step 5

Combine 60ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>milk with your cornflour, soy sauce, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and pepper and 2 tbsp [<span class="text-purple">3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour in a measuring jug, then whisk until you get a smooth batter – this is your spiced batter

Pour the spiced batter over the floured onions and give everything a mix so they are nicely coated – these are your battered onions


### Step 6

Season your rump steak[s] all over with salt and pepper

When the chips have 15 min left, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once it is very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Rest the cooked rump steak on a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 7

Carefully wipe the reserved pan with some kitchen paper (it will be hot!) and return it to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan)

Once hot, add the battered onions and cook for 2 min on each side or until golden and crisp – these are your onion rings

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!

Chop the remaining lemon into 2 wedges per person

### Step 8

Serve the rested rump steak with the smoky chips, soured cream & chive dip and shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle a little olive oil and the juice of half your lemon wedges over the shredded lettuce

Top the steak with the onion rings and garnish with a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!
