## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Chop the remaining inner courgette stem[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized chunks

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped courgette to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped tomato[es] and cook for 4-5 min further or until tender


### Step 3

While the vegetables are softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 4

Once the tomatoes are tender, add your tomato paste, chopped garlic and dried oregano to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your orzo and stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min or until almost cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to prevent it from sticking!


### Step 5

Once the orzo is almost cooked, stir through half of your pesto


### Step 6

Add your haddock bites to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through and the orzo is tender – this is your haddock & red pesto orzo

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the salad and courgette ribbons in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and your white wine vinegar, then give everything a gentle mix up – this is your courgette salad

### Step 8

Serve the haddock & red pesto orzo with the courgette salad to the side

Drizzle over the remaining pesto

Enjoy!
