## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop half your red onion[s] into 2 wedges per person (you'll use the rest later!)

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Combine 2/3 of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) with your curry powder, ground paprika, honey and vegetable stock mix in a large bowl

Add the chopped garlic, the juice of half your lemon[s], a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your curry marinade

Chop your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add the chopped basa and red onion wedges to the curry marinade, give everything a good mix up and set aside

Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Transfer the marinated basa and onion to an oven-proof dish with any remaining curry marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until the fish is cooked through and beginning to brown – this is your curried fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

While the basa and rice are cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and slice the remaining onion finely

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges


### Step 6

Add the tomato wedges, sliced cucumber and sliced onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and the juice from the remaining lemon

Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your chunky salad


### Step 7

Add your flaked almonds to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min or until lightly browned – these are your toasted almonds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Add the toasted almonds to the drained brown rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your almond rice

### Step 8

Serve the curried basa over the almond rice with the chunky salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining natural yoghurt over the fish

Enjoy!
