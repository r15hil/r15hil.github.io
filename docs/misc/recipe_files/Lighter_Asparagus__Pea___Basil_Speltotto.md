### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then boil a full kettle

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Once the leek has softened, add the spelt to the pan and cook for a further 1 min

Add the vegetable stock and cook, covered, for 25-30 min, stirring occasionally, until the spelt is tender with a slight bite

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 4

Whilst the spelt is cooking, chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

### Step 5

Add most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) to a pestle & mortar with a generous pinch of salt and bash to a paste

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon and give it a good mix up – this is your basil drizzle

Cut the remaining lemon into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> wedges

### Step 6

While the spelt is cooking, trim the woody ends off the asparagus, then chop in half and set the asparagus tips aside and roughly chop the asparagus stalks

Add the asparagus tips to a baking paper-lined tray and sprinkle over half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until the asparagus tips are cooked and the cheese is melted and crisp – these are your cheesy asparagus tips

### Step 7

Once the spelt is almost cooked, add the blanched peas and chopped asparagus stalks and cook for a further 2-3 min or until tender

Add the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a generous grind of black pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your lighter asparagus & pea speltotto

### Step 8

Serve the lighter asparagus & pea speltotto topped with the basil drizzle and cheesy asparagus tips

Garnish with the reserved chopped basil and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
