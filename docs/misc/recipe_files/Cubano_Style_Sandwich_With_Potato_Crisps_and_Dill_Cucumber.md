Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the filled ciabattas and press them down very firmly with a spatula

### Step 8

Slice each Cubano-style sandwich in half on the diagonal and serve with the potato crisps and salad to the side

Drizzle a little olive oil and reserved pickling liquid over the salad

Enjoy!
