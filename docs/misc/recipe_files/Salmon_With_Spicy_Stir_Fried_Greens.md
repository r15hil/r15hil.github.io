## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9-10 min, or until cooked through, turning once halfway

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 2

Whilst the salmon is cooking, trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the halved green beans and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once the beans have started to soften, add the shredded kale to the pan with your ginger paste and garlic

Add a small splash of water and a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the greens are tender with a slight bite


### Step 6

Add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, sriracha and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan

Squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s] and add a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up â€“ these are your spicy stir-fried greens


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 8

Serve the cooked salmon with the spicy stir-fried greens to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, toasted sesame seeds and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
