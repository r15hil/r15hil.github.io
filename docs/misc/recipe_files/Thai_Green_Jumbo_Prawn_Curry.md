### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 2-3 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped courgette and your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further until the courgette has started to soften

### Step 4

While the courgette softens, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, Thai green curry paste and a pinch of sugar in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Add your ground turmeric and your lime leaf[ves] – this is your Thai green curry stock

### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1589292978842-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the Thai green curry stock to the pan along with the juice of half your lime[s] and cook for 2-3 min, or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your Thai green jumbo prawn curry

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-copy-1654526696006-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Chop your red chilli[es] into rounds

### Step 8

Serve the Thai green jumbo prawn curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
