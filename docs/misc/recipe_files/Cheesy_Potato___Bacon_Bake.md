## Ingredients

- Smoked streaky bacon (90g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (45g) x0
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Brown onion
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add the potato discs to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt, then sprinkle them with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your smoked streaky bacon into small bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp


### Step 3

While the bacon is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Once the bacon is beginning to crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add the sliced onion

Cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, boil half a kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese finely


### Step 5

Dissolve your soft cheese with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>boiled water and 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> milk – this is your stock

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add a knob of butter to the pan

Once melted, add 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min

Add the stock to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly thickened – this is your cheesy bacon sauce


### Step 7

Layer half the softened potatoes in an oven-proof dish then pour over half the cheesy bacon sauce

Top with the remaining potatoes, pour over the remaining cheesy bacon sauce and top with the remaining grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until bubbling and cooked through – this is your cheesy potato & bacon bake

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy potato & bacon bake with the salad to the side

Drizzle a little olive oil over the salad and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
