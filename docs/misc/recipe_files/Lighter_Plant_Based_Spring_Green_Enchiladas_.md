## Description

To lighten up these enchiladas, we're swapping tortillas for spring greens. You'll roll the leaves around a smoky black bean filling, before topping with plant-based cheese, pumpkin seeds and chipotle mayo.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

While the onion is softening, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans

Add the sliced pepper and drained black beans to the pan with the ground cumin and ground smoked paprika

Add your finely chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix, half the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly reduced – this is your enchilada filling

### Step 4

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discarding the tough stalks

Add the spring green leaves to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to wilt them slightly

### Step 5

Once the sauce has slightly reduced, remove the pan from the heat and add a large spoonful of the enchilada filling to the base of an oven-proof dish

Lay 2 wilted spring green leaves per person out on a clean board and add a couple of spoonfuls of the enchilada filling to the centre of each leaf (leave enough for the topping!)

Roll the loaded leaves tightly lengthways – these are your spring green enchiladas

### Step 6

Add the spring green enchiladas to the dish and lay any leftover spring green leaves on top

Top the enchiladas with the remaining enchilada filling and grate your mature cheddar style block over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until the grated cheeze has melted – these are your lighter plant-based spring green enchiladas

### Step 7

Whilst the enchiladas are in the oven, combine the remaining chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your mayo – this is your chipotle mayo

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Set the lighter plant-based spring green enchiladas in the centre of the table, ready to share

Top with the chopped coriander and pumpkin seeds and dollop over the chipotle mayo

Enjoy!
