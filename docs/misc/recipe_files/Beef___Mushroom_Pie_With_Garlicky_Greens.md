## Ingredients

- Spring greens (150g)
- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Beef stock mix (11g)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Garlic clove x2
- British beef mince (250g)
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)

- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your beef mince to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a generous grind of pepper

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

While the mince is browning, dissolve your beef stock mix, tomato paste and soy sauce in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your beef stock

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 5

Once the mince has browned, add half the chopped garlic to the pan (save the rest for later!) with the sliced mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

Add the beef stock, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-18 min or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef & mushroom pie mix


### Step 6

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your pie lid[s]


### Step 7

Once the pastry is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens with the remaining chopped garlic and a small splash of cold water and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite– these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Serve the pie lid over the beef & mushroom pie mix with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!
