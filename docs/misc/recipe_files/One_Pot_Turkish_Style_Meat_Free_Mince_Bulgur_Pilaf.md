### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your tomatoes into wedges

### Step 3

Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the dish with your dried oregano, bay leaf[ves] and baharat and<span class="text-danger"> </span>cook for 2-3 min, breaking the mince into rough, large chunks until very lightly browned all over

### Step 4

Meanwhile, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and slice into rings

Add the pepper rings and tomato wedges to the dish, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir

Put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 15 min

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1634715944051-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>boiled water and set aside for later – this is your tomato stock

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1634715947355-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your bulgur wheat and tomato stock

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 15 min further – this is your Turkish-style meat-free mince bulgur pilaf

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1634715950255-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand (keep the lid on!) for 10 min further

Tip: This will help to make the bulgur fluffy!

### Step 8

To serve, fluff the Turkish-style meat-free mince bulgur pilaf with a fork

Dollop your natural yoghurt over the top and scatter the chopped coriander all over

Sprinkle over your ground sumac

Let everyone dig in!
