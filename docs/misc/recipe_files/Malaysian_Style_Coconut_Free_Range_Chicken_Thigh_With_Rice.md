## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways and slice finely


### Step 2

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 3

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Add your free range chicken thighs and sprinkle over half of your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Chop half your red chilli[es] roughly, and finely slice the rest into rounds (save these for garnish!)

Put everything into a food processor (can't handle the heat? Go easy on the chilli!)


### Step 6

Add your ground almonds and remaining ground turmeric to the food processor with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Add your soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of sugar

Pulse until you're left with a slightly chunky paste – this is your Malaysian-style spice paste

Add the Malaysian-style spice paste to the chicken and cook for 5-6 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your tamarind paste with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [170ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then add it to the pan and cook for 1 min further

Using two forks, pull the cooked chicken into big chunks – this is your Malaysian-style coconut free range chicken thigh

### Step 8

Serve the Malaysian-style coconut free range chicken thigh with the basmati rice and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
