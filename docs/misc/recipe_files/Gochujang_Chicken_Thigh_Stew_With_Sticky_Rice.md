## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into thin batons


### Step 2

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs, then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 4

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until starting to brown


### Step 5

Once starting to brown, add the carrot batons and chopped pepper to the pan with the grated ginger, chopped garlic and your toasted sesame oil and cook for a further 3-4 min or until fragrant and starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water – this is your spiced stock


### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, add the spiced stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar to the pan with a grind of pepper and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the chicken is cooked, add the spinach to the pan and cook for a final 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your gochujang chicken thigh stew

### Step 8

Serve the gochujang chicken thigh stew and sticky rice in separate bowls

Garnish the stew with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
