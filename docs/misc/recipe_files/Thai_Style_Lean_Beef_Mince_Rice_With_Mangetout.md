### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and sprinkle in your beef stock mix

Cook for 3-4 min or until the lean beef mince is browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Add your mangetout to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Add your red Thai curry paste, ginger paste and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] into 2 wedges per person

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste, a pinch of sugar and a small splash of water to the pan and mix until everything is combined

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains then add to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go and give everything a good mix up

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1610620516336-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Stir through half of the chopped basil and the juice of half the lime wedges (save the rest for garnish!)

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice is piping hot and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Thai-style lean beef mince rice with mangetout

Note: Please make sure you cook your beef thoroughly as cooking equipment varies

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style lean beef mince rice with mangetout and garnish with the reserved chopped basil, a lime wedge and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
