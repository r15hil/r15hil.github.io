## Ingredients

- 0 Tenderstem broccoli
- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 red chilli
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 1 medium egg noodles
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 tsp cornflour
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 0 soy sauce
- 0 hoisin sauce
- 30ml soy sauce
- 40g hoisin sauce
- 2 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and chop your garlic and ginger, then cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Chop all of these together as finely as you can (can't handle the heat? Save some of the chilli for another recipe!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and your five-spice mix and cook for 4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

While the meat-free mince is cooking, combine your cornflour with 125ml <span class="text-purple">[160ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[210ml] </span>cold water in a bowl and give it a good whisk

Add your hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your sticky stir-fry sauce


### Step 5

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 6

Add your medium egg noodles and halved Tenderstem broccoli to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil and cook over a high heat for 5 min or until the noodles are cooked and the broccoli is tender

Once done, drain the noodles & broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 7

Once the meat-free mince has started to brown, add the sticky stir-fry sauce to the pan with half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the meat-free mince is cooked through

Add the drained noodles & broccoli and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky meat-free mince & broccoli noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the sticky meat-free mince & broccoli noodle stir-fry

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
