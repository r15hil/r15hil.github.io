### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid then, cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces, then add to a bowl with your cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, add the coated paneer to the pan with your cashews and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small pieces, then add to a heatproof bowl, cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top, put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 4-5 min or until fork-tender

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Once the paneer and cashews are starting to brown, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic to the pan

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the cooked sweet potato to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your paneer, sweet potato & cashew curry

### Step 7

Whilst the curry is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the paneer, sweet potato & cashew curry over the cooked brown rice with the cooked chicken to the side

Chop your coriander roughly over the curry with scissors

Enjoy!
