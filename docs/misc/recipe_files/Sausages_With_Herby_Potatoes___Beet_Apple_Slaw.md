## Ingredients

- 6 Cumberland sausages
- 15ml cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp dried dill
- 1 carrot
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (30ml)
- 1 seasonal British apple 
- 20g horseradish cream
- 1 spring onion
- 250g cooked beetroot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Cut all the waxy potatoes into bite-sized chunks


Add them to a mixing bowl with a drizzle of <span class="text-highlight">olive oil, the</span> dried dill and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Give everything a good mix


### Step 2

Add the dill crusted potatoes to a baking tray


Snuggle the Cumberland sausages in amongst them


Put the tray in the oven for 30-40 min or until both are golden and crisp (alternatively, cook the sausages on the BBQ until they are slightly charred and cooked through!)


Tip: use two trays if you are cooking for 4, so there is space in between the potatoes


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, horseradish, <span class="text-highlight">cider vinegar</span> and a drizzle of olive oil in a large mixing bowl


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Stir the sliced spring onion into the horseradish mayo


### Step 4

Drain the cooked beetroot 


Peel and top and tail the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Quarter the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skins on) and discard the core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 5

Set a sieve (or colander with small holes) over a bowl


Grate the beetroot, carrot, and apple into the sieve


### Step 6

Squeeze the <span class="text-highlight">juice</span> out of the grated mixture with your hands


Discard the juice (or drink it for an immune boost!)


### Step 7

Add the squeezed beetroot, apple and carrot to the horseradish mayo and season with plenty of salt and pepper


Give it a good mix – this is your beetroot, apple and horseradish slaw


Set your slaw aside until your sausages and potatoes are ready

### Step 8

Serve the cooked Cumberland sausages and dill crusted potatoes with the beetroot, apple and horseradish slaw to the side


Enjoy!
