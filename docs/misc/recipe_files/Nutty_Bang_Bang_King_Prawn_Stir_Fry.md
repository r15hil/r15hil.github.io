## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Rip the green leaves from your pak choi and set them aside

Chop the white bases into rough, large pieces

Discard the tough stalks


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Once done, drain and return them to the bowl with the toasted sesame oil and stir it all together – these are your sesame noodles


### Step 4

Once hot, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped white pak choi bases and cook for a further 30 secs


### Step 5

Add your roasted garlic paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2 min further


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the peanut butter with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl give everything a good mix up

Add your soy sauce and rice vinegar and mix until a smooth sauce remains – this is your bang bang dressing

Tip: Use a small whisk to mix it well!


### Step 7

Rip the pak choi leaves into the pan and cook for 2 min further or until wilted

Add your sesame noodles and toss it all together – this is your king prawn stir-fry

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 8

Set the king prawn stir-fry in the centre of the table, ready to share

Drizzle the bang bang dressing all over, garnish with the roasted peanuts and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
