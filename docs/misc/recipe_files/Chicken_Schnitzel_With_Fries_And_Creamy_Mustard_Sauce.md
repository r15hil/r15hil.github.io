### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Whilst the fries are cooking, slice your cucumber finely

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Add the sliced cucumber and chopped dill to a bowl with your cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

### Step 3

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened then season with salt

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl, then add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate with a drizzle of olive oil

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, then add to the milk and firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 2 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, transfer the chicken to a baking tray (reserve the pan!) and put the tray in the oven for 14-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken schnitzel

### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 6

Wipe the reserved pan clean (careful, it will be hot!) and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine, chicken stock, double cream and wholegrain mustard with a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your creamy mustard sauce

### Step 8

Serve the chicken schnitzel over the fries with the quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the creamy mustard sauce all over and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
