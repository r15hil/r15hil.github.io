### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Meanwhile, slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

### Step 3

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add half of the red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the curry powder, ground allspice and ground coriander and cook for 1-2 min further

### Step 4

Meanwhile, remove the creamed coconut from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly

Add the chopped creamed coconut to the pan with the soy sauce and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[275ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

### Step 5

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the chicken is cooked through – this is your Jamaican-Style Chicken Stew

Note: please ensure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Drain and rinse the kidney beans

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1809.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat and add the cooked white long grain rice and drained kidney beans with a pinch of salt 

Return the pan to the heat and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – these are your rice & peas

### Step 8

Set the Jamaican-Style Chicken Stew and rice & peas in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and remaining sliced red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
