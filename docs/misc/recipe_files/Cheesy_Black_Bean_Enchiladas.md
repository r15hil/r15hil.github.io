Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your black beans

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground cumin and ground smoked paprika

Cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans to the pan with the tomato stock and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened

Once thickened, mash half the black beans in the pan, then add the spinach with a pinch of salt and a splash of boiled water and cook for a further 1 min or until just wilted – this is your enchilada filling

### Step 6

Divide 3/4 of the enchilada filling (save some for later!) between your tortillas, covering only half of each tortilla

Roll up the tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas

### Step 7

Place the enchiladas in an oven-proof dish (or two!), seam side down

Top with the remaining enchilada filling and grated cheese

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the cheese is golden and melted – these are your cheesy black bean enchiladas

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy black bean enchiladas

Enjoy!
