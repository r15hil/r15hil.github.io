While the sweet potato[es] are in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and spoon the cheesy filling over the top

Sprinkle your flaked almonds over and return the tray to the oven for a final 3-4 min

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Meanwhile, add the chopped parsley, diced onion and half the honey-Dijon dressing (save the rest for later!) to the couscous and stir everything together – this is your herby couscous

Drizzle over the remaining honey-Dijon dressing

Enjoy!
