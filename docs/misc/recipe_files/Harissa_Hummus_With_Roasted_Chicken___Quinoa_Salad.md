## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving


### Step 2

While the quinoa is cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the red onion wedges and chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your chickpeas

Peel and roughly chop your garlic


### Step 4

Add the drained chickpeas to a food processor with the chopped garlic, 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water and the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s]

Add your tahini, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a very generous pinch of salt and blitz for 1-2 min or until fully combined and smooth – this is your harissa hummus


### Step 5

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 6

Once the onion wedges are cooked, add them to the pot of drained quinoa with the grated carrot and chopped mint

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted onion & quinoa salad


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl and squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon – these are your lemon-dressed leaves

Once cooked, slice the chicken

### Step 8

Dollop the harissa hummus onto plates and spread it out with the back of a spoon

Serve the sliced chicken over the hummus with the lemon-dressed leaves and roasted onion & quinoa salad to the side

Sprinkle your pumpkin seeds and black sesame seeds all over

Enjoy!
