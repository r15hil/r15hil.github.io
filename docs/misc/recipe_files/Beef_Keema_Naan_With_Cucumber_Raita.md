## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Garam masala (1tsp) x0
- Ground cumin (1tbsp)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Plain naan (2pcs)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- British beef mince (250g)

- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the base of your naans from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s], then combine the sliced shallot with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Dissolve your<span class="text-danger"> </span>chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once done, push the browned beef mince to one side of the pan

Add your ground cumin and garam masala to the other side of the pan and cook for 1-2 min until fragrant


### Step 5

Add the chicken stock and the chopped tomatoes to the pan and stir everything together

Cook for 2 min or until reduced and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced beef mince


### Step 6

Meanwhile, spread your mango chutney over your naan[s]

Add the mango naan[s] to the warmed baking tray[s] and top them with the spiced beef mince

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 5-10 min or until golden – this is your beef keema naan[s]


### Step 7

While the naan[s] is in the oven, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add the grated cucumber, your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber raita

### Step 8

Serve the beef keema naan[s] with a dollop of cucumber raita

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot

Enjoy!
