## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 0 garam masala
- 0 tomato paste
- 120g spinach
- 1 raw peeled king prawns
- 0 basmati white rice
- 32g tomato paste 
- 171g raw peeled king prawns	
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 0 dried chilli flakes
- 130g basmati rice
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 star anise
- 3 cardamom pods
- 0 spinach
- 5g coriander

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s] and your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5 min or until softened


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Melt a knob of butter in a pot (with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once melted, add the crushed cardamom pods and star anise to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Add your basmati rice to the pot and cook for 1 min further, then add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your pilau rice


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced garlic, ground fenugreek, garam masala and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Tip: If your pan is looking a little dry, add a small drizzle of vegetable oil!


### Step 5

While the spices are cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add the tomato stock to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water over it until it's wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool enough to handle

Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the chopped spinach and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your fragrant king prawn saag masala

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Stir the chopped coriander through the pilau rice, discard the star anise and cardamom pods

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant king prawn saag masala with the pilau rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
