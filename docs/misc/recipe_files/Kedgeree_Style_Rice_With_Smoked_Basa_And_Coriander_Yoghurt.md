### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened and beginning to caramelise

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the drained sweetcorn to the pan with your white long grain rice

Cook for 1 min further, stirring to coat the grains in all the spices

### Step 4

Add 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, add your smoked basa fillets to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine your natural yoghurt with half the chopped coriander (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your coriander yoghurt

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through the remaining chopped coriander with the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your kedgeree-style rice

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa over the kedgeree-style rice

Dollop over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
