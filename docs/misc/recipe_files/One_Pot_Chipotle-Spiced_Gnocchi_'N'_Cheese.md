Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice finely

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi, diced pepper and halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp and slightly char

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need 2 pans!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into 2 wedges per person

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Once the gnocchi is slightly crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>butter with the chopped garlic and your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1-2 min or until the butter is melted and give everything a good mix up

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs

### Step 6

Once thickened, stir through your soft cheese and most of the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Cook for a final 1 min or until the cheese has melted

Add the juice of half of the lime wedges (save the rest for a garnish!) and give everything a good mix up

### Step 7

Once the cheese has melted, top with the remaining grated cheese (don't mix!)

Put the lid on the pan and set aside for 1-2 min or until the cheese has melted

Once melted, top with your crispy onions and the sliced spring onion – this is your one pot chipotle-spiced gnocchi 'n' cheese

### Step 8

Serve the one pot chipotle-spiced gnocchi 'n' cheese and garnish with a lime wedge

Season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
