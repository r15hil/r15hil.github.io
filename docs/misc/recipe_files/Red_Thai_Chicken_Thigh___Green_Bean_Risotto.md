## Description

We've taken risotto, and combined it with a creamy Thai-style curry. Inspired, or crazy? You decide. You'll cook rice and aromatics with chicken thighs, and simmer the ingredients in a rich red curry stock. Add greens for goodness and finish with lime.

### Step 1

Boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Season your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned diced chicken thigh and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 2

While the chicken is browning, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

### Step 3

Once the chicken is golden, transfer it to a clean plate (this will finish cooking in the risotto later) and reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped ginger to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped tomato and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the tomato has broken down

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 700ml <span class="text-purple">[950ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2 L]</span> boiled water with your red Thai curry paste – this is your red Thai stock

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Once the tomato has broken down, add your arborio rice with half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the mixture

Add 2/3 of the red Thai stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for an initial 20 min or until the rice is almost cooked

### Step 6

Cut your lime[s] in half

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1650989632586-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After the initial 20 min, return the browned chicken to the pan with the chopped green beans, spinach and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Pour in the remaining red Thai stock with the juice of half the lime[s] and cook for a final 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and all of the stock is absorbed – this is your red Thai chicken & green bean risotto

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the red Thai chicken & green bean risotto in bowls

Garnish with a lime wedge and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
