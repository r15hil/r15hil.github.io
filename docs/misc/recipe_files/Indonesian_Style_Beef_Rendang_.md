## Ingredients

- 160g trimmed fine green beans
- 250g British beef strips
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 130g basmati rice
- 1 chipotle paste sachet (20g)
- 50g solid coconut cream
- 15ml fish sauce
- 3 cardamom pods
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Cut the green beans in half


### Step 2

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the halved green beans to the pot

Cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice


### Step 3

While the rice and beans are cooking, peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic and ginger

Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pods

Grind the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, cardamom seeds, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a coarse paste – this is your spice paste


### Step 4

Remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly

Dissolve the chopped coconut cream in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water then add the fish sauce – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the beef strips and cook for 1-2 min or until browned and cooked through

Transfer the cooked beef strips to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the spice paste and chipotle paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan

Cook for a further 2-5 min or until the sauce is very thick


### Step 7

Return the cooked beef strips to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your beef rendang

Fluff the green bean rice with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the beef rendang with the green bean rice to the side

Enjoy!
