## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp hot harissa paste 
- 100g carrots
- 100g baby leaf mixed salad
- 30g 3 seed mix
- 300g potatoes
- 1 tsp lemony sumac
- 125g fresh mozzarella 
- 1 tsp French Dijon mustard 
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (26ml)
- 1 aubergine 
- 30g dried cranberries

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Cut the potatoes (skin on) into thin wedges


Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, season generously with salt and pepper and oven roast for 30 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat


Once<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>hot, add the 3 seed mix and toast for 1-2&nbsp;min or until slightly browned and starting to pop


Set&nbsp;the toasted seeds aside to cool - reserve the pan


### Step 3

Meanwhile, top and tail, then slice your aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> equally thick slices, discard the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Season generously with salt and pepper, then coat each cut side evenly with harissa paste


Tip: this can be done in a bowl using clean hands


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil


Once hot, add the aubergine


Cover and cook for 6 min, turning halfway through, or until both sides are nicely charred


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice the mozzarella ball<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 6 even slices


Chop the cranberries roughly


Peel&nbsp;the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Combine the carrot and washed salad


### Step 6

Once nicely&nbsp;charred, remove the aubergine pan from the heat


Place one slice of mozzarella over each aubergine disc


Cover with a lid (this will help the mozzarella melt) and set aside until serving


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Combine the dijon, mayonnaise, sumac, a pinch of sugar and 1-2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2-4 tbsp]</span> olive oil then season with a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your dressing

Serve the chips to the side


Enjoy!
