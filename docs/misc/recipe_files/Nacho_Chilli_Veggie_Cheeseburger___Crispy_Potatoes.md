### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin rounds

Add the potato rounds to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your meat free patty[ies] to a bowl with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a generous grind of pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a very good mix up until fully combined

Divide the mixture into 1 thin patty per person – this are your chipotle veggie patty[ies]

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] finely

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Add everything to a bowl with a pinch of pepper and set aside – this is your pico de gallo

### Step 6

Melt 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and stir through the grated cheese and chopped green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your nacho chilli cheese sauce

### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

### Step 8

Fill the toasted brioche bun with a chipotle veggie patty, a dollop of nacho chilli cheese sauce and the pico de gallo

Serve the crispy potatoes on the side along with any remaining nacho chilli cheese sauce

Enjoy!
