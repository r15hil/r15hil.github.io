## Ingredients

- Red pepper
- Toasted sesame oil (10ml)
- Ginger paste (15g)
- Spring onion x2
- British diced chicken breast (125g) x0
- Medium egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- British diced chicken breast (250g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Hoisin sauce (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into batons

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the noodles and set aside


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, spring onion batons and sliced pepper to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your toasted sesame oil to the drained noodles and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame noodles


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, reduce the heat to low and add your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, sesame noodles and a splash of water to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are coated in the sauce – this is your Chinese-style chicken breast & pepper chow mein

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style chicken breast & pepper chow mein

Enjoy!
