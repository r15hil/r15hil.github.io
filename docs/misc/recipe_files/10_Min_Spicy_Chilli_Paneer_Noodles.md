### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Cut the paneer into cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the paneer with the ginger & garlic paste and soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to golden

### Step 3

Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

While the noodles are cooking, trim, then chop the spring onions roughly

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 5

Once the paneer is golden, add the chopped spring onion to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until softened

When the noodles are almost cooked, add the sliced pepper to the noodles and cook for 1-2 min further

Once done, drain the noodles and red pepper and reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water

Stir until dissolved, then add the sriracha, tomato ketchup, rice wine vinegar and dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and a generous pinch of sugar

Stir it all together – this is your chilli sauce
