Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Separate your duck leg[s] from the white duck fat and duck jelly (you'll use these later!)

### Step 2

Add the duck leg[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 28-30 min or until the duck is golden and crispy – this is your roast duck

### Step 4

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened and glossy – this is your yaki sauce

Set aside the yaki sauce for later

### Step 6

Once the duck is almost ready, add your udon noodles to a large bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside to soak for 4-5 min

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Drain the soaked noodles

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your mooli slaw mix with the drained udon noodles and half the yaki sauce (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min – this is your yaki udon

### Step 8

Serve the yaki udon topped with the roast duck

Pour over the remaining yaki sauce and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
