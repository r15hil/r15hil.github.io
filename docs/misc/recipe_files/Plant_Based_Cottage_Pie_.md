### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, diced carrot and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-8 min or until slightly softened

### Step 4

Once softened, add your ultimate vegan burger patty[ies] to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go (to resemble mince) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown all over

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

### Step 5

Once the meat-free mince has browned, add your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix, Marmite and a splash of cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly thickened – this is your pie mixture

### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 7

Pour the pie mixture into the base of an oven-proof dish, then spread the mash evenly on top

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your plant-based cottage pie

### Step 8

Once cooked, remove the plant-based cottage pie from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the plant-based cottage pie

Enjoy!
