## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel your garlic and finely slice 2<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [3] </span>[4]</span> cloves in half (save the rest for later!)

Add the chopped potatoes and sliced garlic to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Chop your black olives roughly

Chop (or grate) the remaining garlic finely

Combine the chopped tomatoes, chopped olives and chopped garlic in a bowl with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your tomato tapenade


### Step 3

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Cut pieces of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper (1 per person!)

Add your basa fillet[s] to the middle of each piece of paper and place on a baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 4

Divide the tomato tapenade evenly between each basa fillet and season with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the fish to form a sealed parcel[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your tomato tapenade baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Pat your capers dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, carefully add the capers and cook for 1-2 min or until crispy and puffed up a little

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserving the pan – these are your crispy capers


### Step 6

Trim your green beans

Carefully wipe the reserved pan clean

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add the trimmed green beans with a pinch of salt and a small splash of water

Cook, covered, for 3 min or until softened


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Return the cooked potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth

Remove the pot from the heat, add most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and mix to combine – this is your garlic mash

### Step 8

Serve the tomato tapenade baked basa over the garlic mash with the cooked green beans to the side

Garnish with the crispy capers and remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
