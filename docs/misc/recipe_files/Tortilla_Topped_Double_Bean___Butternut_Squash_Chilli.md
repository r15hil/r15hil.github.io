- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Red kidney beans (185g)
- Black beans (185g)
- Spring onion
- Ground coriander (2tsp)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Butternut squash cubes (160g)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-7 min or until the butternut squash cubes are fork-tender


### Step 2

While the butternut squash is in the microwave, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Stack the tortillas and slice into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 3-4 min or until lightly browned and beginning to crisp


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high-heat

Once hot, add the ground coriander and smoked paprika to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped garlic and softened butternut squash and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has softened


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix and half the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans and kidney beans

Add the drained beans and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and cook for a further 2 min – this is your double bean & butternut squash chilli


### Step 6

Transfer the double bean & butternut squash chilli to an oven-proof dish and top with the browned tortilla triangles

Tip: Make sure some of them are spiking up for extra crunch, the bottom bits will soak up all that yummy sauce!

Put the tortilla-topped double bean & butternut squash chilli in the oven for 5-6 min or until the tortilla triangles are nice and crispy


### Step 7

While the tortilla-topped double bean & butternut squash chilli is in the oven, trim, then chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Combine the remaining chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with the mayo in a small bowl – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Sprinkle the chopped spring onion and chopped tomato over the top of the tortilla-topped double bean & butternut squash chilli and drizzle over the chipotle mayo

Set the tortilla-topped double bean & butternut squash chilli in the centre of the table and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
