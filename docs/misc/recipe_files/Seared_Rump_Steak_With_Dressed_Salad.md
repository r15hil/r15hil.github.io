## Ingredients

- British rump pavé steak (300g)
- British rump pavé steak (150g) x0
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your waxy potatoes into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your crispy potatoes


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel most of your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese


### Step 4

Slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, and once very hot add the seasoned rump steak

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Tip: Don’t be tempted to move the steak around too much in the pan – this will stop them from browning


### Step 6

Once cooked, transfer the seared rump steak to a plate and leave them to rest for 5 min

Meanwhile, add your balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and mix well to combine – this is your balsamic vinaigrette


### Step 7

When the steak has rested, pour any resting juices from the plate into the balsamic vinaigrette

Slice the rested seared rump steak finely on a clean board

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the halved tomatoes, salad and grated Italian hard cheese to the bowl with the balsamic vinaigrette and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the dressed salad over the crispy potatoes and top with the sliced seared rump steak and Italian hard cheese shavings

Enjoy!
