## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Top, tail (no need to peel!) and grate your carrot[s] into a very large bowl

Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly and add them to the bowl


### Step 3

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Chop your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and curry powder and cook for 3 min, turning once halfway, until golden


### Step 5

While the paneer is cooking, combine half your mango chutney (you'll use the rest later!) with your white wine vinegar, 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mango dressing

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems


### Step 6

Increase the heat to high and add the remaining mango chutney and your nigella seeds to the pan with the paneer

Cook for a further 1 min or until sticky – this is your sticky paneer


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad, rinsed lentils and mango dressing to the bowl with the grated carrot & halved cherry tomatoes and give everything a good mix up – this is your Indian-style lentil salad

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style lentil salad and top with the sticky paneer and the chopped coriander and mint

Enjoy!
