## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts and cut half the sprouts in half (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals


### Step 3

Once hot, add the onion petals and halved sprouts to the pan with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, slice the remaining Brussels sprouts finely

Once the onion and sprouts have softened slightly, reduce the heat to medium-high

Drain your king prawns, then add to the pan and cook for an initial 1-2 min


### Step 5

Squeeze the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

After an initial 1-2 min, add the sliced Brussels sprouts and cooked white long grain rice to the pan

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the rice is hot and the prawns are cooked through


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your mayo, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your sriracha mayo


### Step 7

Add your hoisin sauce to the pan with the remaining toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your king prawn & sprout fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn & sprout fried rice drizzled with the sriracha mayo

Season with a generous pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
