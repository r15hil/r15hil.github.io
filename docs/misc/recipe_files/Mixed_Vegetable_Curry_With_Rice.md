## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped potato with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 4

Once the potato is lightly golden, add your tomato paste to the pan with your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and a pinch of sugar and salt and mix it all together


### Step 6

Add the pepper strips, halved green beans and cashew nuts to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min

After the initial 10 min, remove the lid and cook for a final 4-5 min – this is your mixed vegetable curry


### Step 7

While the curry is cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 8

Serve the mixed vegetable curry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
