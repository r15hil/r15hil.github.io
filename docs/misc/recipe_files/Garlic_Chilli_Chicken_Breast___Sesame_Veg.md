### Step 1

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and keep covered until serving

Meanwhile, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces

### Step 4

Add the diced chicken breast and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your soy chicken

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the carrot discs with the soy chicken to the pan and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until the chicken has browned all over

### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped pepper and garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper has slightly softened

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your honey, red chilli relish, toasted sesame oil, remaining soy sauce, rice vinegar and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl – this is your sesame chilli sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1636541663627-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once slightly softened, add your sugar snap peas and sesame chilli sauce and cook for a further 2-3 min or until your chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your garlic chilli chicken & sesame veg

### Step 8

Serve the cooked rice in bowls and top with the garlic chilli chicken & sesame veg

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
