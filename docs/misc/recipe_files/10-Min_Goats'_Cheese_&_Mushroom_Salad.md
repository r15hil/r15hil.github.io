Now, let's get started!


Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Rip the focaccia into rough bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Add the ripped focaccia to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt


Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until lightly crisp – these are your focaccia croutons

### Step 4

Meanwhile, crumble the chestnut mushrooms into the pan 


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5 min or until golden and softened – these are your caramelised mushrooms


Tip: Try not to stir the mushrooms too often, as this will stop them from caramelising!
