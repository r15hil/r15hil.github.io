## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook for 3 min or until tender


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your miso, soft cheese and half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your cracked black pepper – this is your miso cacio e pepe sauce

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once the mushrooms are tender, add your cornflour and the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the miso cacio e pepe sauce with your udon noodles and spinach

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Cook for 2-3 min or until the udon noodles are coated in sauce – this is your miso cacio e pepe udon


### Step 7

While the noodles are cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until the bottom is golden and crisp and the yolk is still runny – this is your crispy fried egg

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 8

Serve the miso cacio e pepe udon topped with a crispy fried egg and the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
