## Ingredients

- 1 bag of roasted peanuts
- 1 red chilli
- 1 soy sauce sachet (15ml)
- 1 toasted sesame oil sachet (15ml)
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 1 carrot
- 5g coriander
- 125g radishes
- 100g brown rice
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Peel the cucumber into 'ribbons'


Top, tail and slice the radishes as finely as you can


Add the carrot ribbons, cucumber ribbons and sliced radishes to a large bowl – this is your salad


### Step 3

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


### Step 4

Combine the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, lime juice and chopped chilli with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your Asian dressing


### Step 5

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and season lightly with salt on both sides


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the basa fillets and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until cooked through and golden – this is your pan-fried fish 


Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the basa fillets are cooking, chop the coriander roughly


### Step 7

Add the Asian dressing to the salad and give it a good mix up – this is your Asian salad

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried fish with the Asian salad and cooked brown rice to the side


Drizzle any remaining dressing over the fish and rice


Garnish with the chopped coriander and roasted peanuts


Enjoy!
