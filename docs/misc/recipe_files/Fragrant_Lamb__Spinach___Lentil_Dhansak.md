## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a low heat

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Once the butter has melted, add the cardamom seeds to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add half the shallot (save the rest for later!) and your garam masala to the pan

Increase the heat to medium and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the shallot is cooking, chop your sultanas roughly

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Once the shallot[s] has softened, increase the heat to high, add your lamb mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the chopped sultanas, chopped garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 min further

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water with your beef stock mix and season with a generous pinch of salt then cook for 5-6 min or until thickened slightly


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your spinach


### Step 6

Add the chopped tomato and remaining shallot to a bowl and drizzle with olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up - this is your tomato & shallot salad


### Step 7

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Add the drained lentils and spinach to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted, the lentils are warmed through and the meat is cooked (no pink meat!)

Mix it all together – this is your fragrant lamb & spinach dhansak

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant lamb & spinach dhansak with the tomato & shallot salad and cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
