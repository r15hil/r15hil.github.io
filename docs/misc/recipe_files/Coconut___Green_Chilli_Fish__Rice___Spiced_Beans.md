## Ingredients

- 3.8g black mustard seeds
- 20g coconut flakes
- 1 green chilli
- 120g trimmed fine green beans
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 25g solid coconut cream
- 130g basmati rice
- 10g coriander & mint mix
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger and garlic

Chop the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely (deseed if you can't handle the heat!)

Strip the mint leaves off their stalks and finely chop

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Add the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

Add the chopped garlic, ginger, green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mint leaves and coriander to a bowl

Squeeze the softened coconut cream out of the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, season with a generous pinch of salt and stir to combine – this is your coconut & green chilli paste


### Step 3

Add the basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and very lightly browned, stirring regularly

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!

Once browned, transfer the browned coconut to a bowl, reserving the pan for later


### Step 5

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add the basa fillets and top each fillet evenly with the coconut & green chilli paste

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the green beans into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the black mustard seeds and cumin seeds and cook for 10-20 secs or until starting to sizzle, then add the chopped green beans and give everything a good mix up

Add a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt then cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until tender with a bite

### Step 8

Serve the coconut & green chilli fish over the rice with the spiced beans to the side

Squeeze the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime over the fish and cut the remaining lime into wedges

Garnish with the toasted coconut flakes and a wedge of lime

Enjoy!
