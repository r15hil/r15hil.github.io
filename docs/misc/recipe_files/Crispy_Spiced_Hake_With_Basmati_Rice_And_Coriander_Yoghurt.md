## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 0 white basmati rice
- 1 tomato
- 2 hake fillets
- 30g gram flour
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 15ml soy sauce
- 130g basmati rice
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 cucumber
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Cut your cucumber in half, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard, then chop into small pieces

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Combine the chopped hake and soy sauce in a bowl with your ginger & garlic paste and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated hake

Add your gram flour to a separate bowl with your ground cumin and most of your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your spiced gram flour


### Step 4

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

Combine the chopped cucumber and chopped tomato in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon juice, half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!), the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato salad

Add the marinated hake to the bowl with the spiced gram flour and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated hake


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy spiced hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the remaining natural yoghurt and chopped coriander with a squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander yoghurt

Cut your remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy spiced hake over the basmati rice with the tomato salad to the side

Drizzle over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
