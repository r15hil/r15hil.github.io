## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a large, oven-proof dish (or two!) with the sliced onion and your sausages

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Put the dish[es] in the oven and cook for an initial 15-20 min, then give eveything a good mix up

Return the dish[es] to the oven and cook for a final 15-20 min or until the potatoes are golden and tender and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese finely


### Step 5

Add 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [170ml]</span> milk to a heatproof jug with the chopped garlic, your Chinese rice wine, grated cheddar, your cornflour and a generous pinch of pepper – this is your tartiflette-inspired sauce

When the dish[es] are almost cooked, add the tartiflette-inspired sauce to the microwave for 2-3 min or until thickened and steaming hot, then stir it all together


### Step 6

Once cooked, remove the dish[es] from the oven and pour the tartiflette-inspired sauce all over, tilting the dish a little so the sauce gets to all the edges of the dish[es]

Return the dish[es] to the oven for a final 5-8 min or until everything is bubbling and golden – this is your one tray tartiflette-inspired sausage and potato bake


### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your cider vinegar to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar and whisk together – this is your dressing

Add the salad to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the one tray tartiflette-inspired sausage and potato bake with the dressed salad to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
