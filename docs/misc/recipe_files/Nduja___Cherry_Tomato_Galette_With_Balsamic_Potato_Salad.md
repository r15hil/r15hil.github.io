## Ingredients

- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Puff pastry (160g)
-  'Nduja (40g)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Waxy potatoes (300g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your 'Nduja into small pieces


### Step 2

Add the halved potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Add half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) with the grated garlic, a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together so the potatoes are evenly coated

Put the baking tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are tender and lightly charred, then set aside to cool slightly – these are your balsamic roast potatoes


### Step 3

Line the baking tray[s] with baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to the tray[s] and prick it all over with a fork (this will stop it getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 4

Combine the chopped 'Nduja and cornflour in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coated 'Nduja


### Step 5

Spread your soft cheese over the pastry, leaving a 2cm border

Top with the coated 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Sprinkle over your dried oregano


### Step 6

Add the halved tomatoes (cut-side up!) to the pastry with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Fold the pastry border over the edge of the filling

Tip: Start from one corner and work around in one direction, overlapping the pastry each time


### Step 7

Put the tray in the oven for 17-20 min or until the pastry is cooked through, golden and crisp and the edges have puffed up – this is your 'Nduja & cherry tomato galette

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drizzle the remaining balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil over the salad and combine with the balsamic potatoes – this is your balsamic roast potato salad

### Step 8

Slice the 'Nduja & cherry tomato galette[s] in half

Serve a slice of 'Nduja & cherry tomato galette with the balsamic roast potato salad to the side

Enjoy!
