### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your chilli oil

### Step 4

Grate your Italian hard cheese

### Step 5

Add your fresh tagliatelle and chopped Tenderstem broccoli to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle and broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

While the tagliatelle is cooking, add your chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock mix to the pan with the chilli oil

Season with a pinch of salt, sugar and a grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened

### Step 7

Once thickened, add the drained tagliatelle and broccoli to the pan, tear in half your basil (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your spicy arrabbiata sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy arrabbiata sauce with fresh tagliatelle topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Tear over the remaining basil

Season with a grind of black pepper and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
