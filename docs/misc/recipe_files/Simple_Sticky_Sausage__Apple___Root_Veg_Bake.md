### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces, then top, tail and chop your parsnip[s] (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Cut your apple[s] into wedges and discard the core

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and onion marmalade in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your sweet onion stock


### Step 4

Add the chopped root veg, apple wedges, crushed garlic and your bay leaf[ves] to a large, deep baking tray (or oven-proof dish)

Tip: Don't overcrowd the tray, use two if you need to!

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 5

Add the sweet onion stock to the tray[s] with your sausages


### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 40-45 min or until the veg is tender and the sausages are golden and cooked through – this is your sticky sausage, apple & root veg bake

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil with a pinch of black pepper in a large bowl

Add the salad and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic salad

### Step 8

Squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins into the bake, discard the skin and give it all a good mix up

Serve the sticky sausage, apple & root veg bake and pour over any remaining juices from the tray[s]

Serve the balsamic salad to the side and sprinkle your pumpkin seeds all over

Enjoy!
