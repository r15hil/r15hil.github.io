### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until everything is starting to brown

Once brown, move the tomatoes and sweet potato to one side of the tray[s], then add the chicken breast portion[s]

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can
