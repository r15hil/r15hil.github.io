### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail, and slice thickly

### Step 2

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min further or until softened

### Step 3

While the leek is softening, place your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, on a clean chopping board

Hold the tail end firmly and using a sharp knife, make a cut between the flesh and skin and continue to cut along the length of the fillet away from yourself until the skin comes away from the fillet, discard the skin

Tip: Keep your knife flat against the board to stop you from cutting through the skin!

Reboil a kettle

### Step 4

Once the leek has softened, add the vegetable stock, crème fraîche, Dijon mustard, chopped dill and bay leaf[ves] to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened

Chop the skinned salmon fillet[s] into large bite-sized pieces and add to the pan, then transfer everything to an oven-proof dish – this is your creamy salmon pie base

Tip: Use individual dishes for fancy presentation!

### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, unwrap and roll your puff pastry to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Lay the puff pastry sheet[s] over the pie dish[es] and trim off any excess, press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish[es]

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and fish is cooked through – this is your creamy salmon & leek pot pie

### Step 6

While the pie is in the oven, peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender, then once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil a kettle

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1643798347715-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Add the chopped parsley and the juice of half your lemon[s] and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your lemony parsley mash

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Serve the creamy salmon & leek pot pie with the lemony parsley mash and peas to the side

Garnish with the lemon wedge

Enjoy!
