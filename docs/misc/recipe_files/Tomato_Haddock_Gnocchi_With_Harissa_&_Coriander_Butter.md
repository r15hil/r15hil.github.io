### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water

### Step 3

While the gnocchi is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and tomato paste to the pan with your dried oregano and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> reserved starchy cooking water, your vegetable stock mix and half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

### Step 5

Add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the pan with a small pinch of salt

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1730365948498-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, add a generous knob of butter to a heatproof bowl and pop it in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until melted

Once melted, stir through your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander with a small pinch of salt – this is your harissa & coriander butter

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1730365958849-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the remaining balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your dressed salad

Once the fish is cooked, stir through the drained gnocchi until everything is fully combined and the gnocchi is warmed through – this is your tomato haddock gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the tomato haddock gnocchi and drizzle over the harissa & coriander butter

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
