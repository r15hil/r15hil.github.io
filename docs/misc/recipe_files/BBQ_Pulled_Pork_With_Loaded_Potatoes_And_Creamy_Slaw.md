Once the potatoes have been cooking for 30 min, remove them from the oven and carefully turn any so that they're all cut-side up

Top the potatoes evenly with the grated cheese

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-7 min or until the cheese has melted and is beginning to crisp slightly – these are your loaded potatoes

Pull the pork apart using two forks, then add your BBQ sauce and stir it all together

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until everything is nice and sticky – this is your BBQ pulled pork

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ pulled pork with loaded potatoes and creamy slaw to the side

Sprinkle the chopped chives over the potatoes and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
