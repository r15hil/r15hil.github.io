## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 0 smoked basa fillet
- 1 white basmati rice
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 0 curry powder
- 130g basmati rice
- 1 ground turmeric
- 2 x 100g smoked basa fillets
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 parsley
- 10g parsley
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half and add them to a baking tray with a pinch of salt, sugar, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened – these are your roasted tomatoes


### Step 2

While the tomatoes are roasting, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a very large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (the salt prevents the egg from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 7 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg

Meanwhile, fill a bowl of very cold water with ice (Gousto's ice packs are perfect) ready for cooling your egg[s] quickly later


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder and ground turmeric and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your basmati rice and cook for 1 min further, stirring to coat the grains in all of the spices

Add 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min


### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Once the egg[s] is done, drain and add to the ice water (this stops any further cooking)

Tip: No ice? Run under very cold running water for 3 min, then set aside in a bowl of cold water


### Step 6

Once the rice is cooked, add the smoked basa to the pan and cook, covered, for 5-7 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, peel the boiled egg[s] then cut into quarters


### Step 7

Once cooked, gently flake the smoked basa and fluff the basmati rice with a fork

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir through the chopped parsley – this is your classic kedgeree

### Step 8

Serve the egg quarters over the classic kedgeree

Garnish with the roasted tomatoes

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
