### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the portobello mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side until starting to brown

Once the mushrooms are starting to brown, reduce the heat to low, add a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered, for 10-12 min

### Step 2

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Tip: This is to warm your tortillas later – alternatively, add them to a plate and pop in the microwave for 1-2 min!

Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

### Step 6

Once done, transfer the cooked mushrooms to a clean board and shred them apart, using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling' – these are your pulled mushrooms

### Step 7

Return the pulled mushrooms to the pan with the hoisin sauce and soy sauce and cook for 2 min or until warmed through – these are your pulled hoisin mushrooms

### Step 8

Assemble the wraps by dividing the shredded lettuce, spring onion strips, cucumber matchsticks and pulled hoisin mushrooms between the warmed tortillas

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
