### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, removing the skins

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice into half moons

### Step 2

Peel your garlic

Add the sliced courgette, onion wedges, tomato wedges, peeled garlic, free range chicken thighs, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and honey to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a really good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

### Step 4

Whilst everything is in the oven, boil a kettle

Add your giant couscous to a pot with 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and rinse briefly under cool water to remove any excess starch

Set aside for later

### Step 6

Once the chicken has had an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the cooked giant couscous

Pour the chicken stock over the top and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your honey-harissa free range chicken & courgette tray bake

### Step 7

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and natural yoghurt in a bowl with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper – this is your herby yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the honey-harissa free range chicken & courgette tray bake with a dollop of the herby yoghurt on top

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
