## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and generous crack of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your tomato paste, chopped garlic and dried oregano with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 3

Grate your lighter cheese

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Place your chicken breast portion[s] onto a separate tin foil-lined baking tray


### Step 5

Spread half the tomato sauce over the chicken

Top with the grated cheese and torn mozzarella

Dollop the remaining tomato sauce over the top

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and all of the cheese has melted – this is your chicken parmigiana


### Step 6

Whilst the chicken is cooking, tear your basil into a pestle & mortar (save a little for garnish) and grind to a paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!

Stir your mayo through the basil paste – this is your basil mayo

### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the ciabatta halves to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Once toasted, spread the ciabatta with the basil mayo and top with the chicken parmigiana and remaining torn basil

Serve the open chicken parmigiana sarnie with the fries and baby leaf salad to the side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper to the salad

Enjoy!
