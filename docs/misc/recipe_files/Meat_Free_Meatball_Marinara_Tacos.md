### Step 2

Combine the ultimate vegan burger patties in a bowl with the panko breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Divide the mixture into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> and shape into meatballs

Add the meat-free meatballs to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

### Step 4

Whilst the onion is softening, dissolve the tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add half the balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 30 secs or until reduced – this is your caramelised onion

Transfer half the caramelised onion to a clean plate for later, keep the remaining caramelised onion in the pan

Add the chopped garlic and dried basil with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock with a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your marinara sauce

Once the meatballs are cooked, remove them from the oven and add them to the marinara sauce then give everything a good mix up – these are your meat-free marinara meatballs

### Step 7

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil – this is your dressing

Add the rocket to the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed rocket

Add the tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill each warmed tortilla with 2 meat-free marinara meatballs and some marinara sauce

Top with the reserved caramelised onion and dressed rocket

Enjoy!
