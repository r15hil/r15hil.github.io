## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Slice your flat white mushroom[s] finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 4 min or until softened


### Step 4

Once softened, add the sliced mushroom with a knob of butter and cook for 5-6 min or until tender


### Step 5

Once the mushroom is tender, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until softened

Add your hoisin sauce with your soy sauce and ginger paste

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant – this is your stir-fry sauce


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 7

Once the stir-fry sauce is fragrant, add the cooked rice with your blanched peas and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until the peas are warmed through – this is your Chinese-style veggie fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the fried egg over the Chinese-style veggie fried rice and season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
