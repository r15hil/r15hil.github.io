## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your tofu into 6 large cubes per person by dividing the block into 3 lengthways and then cutting each slice into quarters

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!) and combine with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 2

Combine your curry powder and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> of the coconut stock with a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl (save the rest of the coconut stock for later!)

Add the tofu cubes, mix well and set aside


### Step 3

Add your peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining coconut stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-low heat

Cook for approx. 15-20 min or until it has reduced to the consistency of a thick custard, stirring occasionally – this is your satay sauce


### Step 4

Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, add it to a separate pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely


### Step 6

Add the sliced cucumber and sliced spring onion to a mixing bowl with your rice vinegar and a large pinch of salt

Mix well and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 7

Thread 3 spiced tofu cubes onto each soaked skewer

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the tofu skewers and cook for 8-10 min, turning throughout, or until evenly charred on all sides – these are your tofu satay skewers

### Step 8

Serve the tofu satay skewers over the brown rice with the quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the satay sauce all over

Enjoy!
