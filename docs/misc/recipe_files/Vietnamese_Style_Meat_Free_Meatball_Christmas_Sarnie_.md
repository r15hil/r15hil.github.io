### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven to heat up

Cut the sweet potatoes (skins on) into chips

Once the oil is hot, add the sweet potato chips, dried sage and a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up and cook for 20-22 min or until the chips are golden – these are your sage sweet potato chips

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate the ginger

Combine the meat-free mince, grated ginger, soy sauce and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your meat-free mince meatball mix

### Step 7

Cut the ciabattas in half, then add to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Spread the warmed ciabatta halves with the cranberry sauce and mayo

To build, fill each ciabatta with a lettuce leaf, pickled root veg ribbons (save the pickling liquid!), meat-free mince meatballs and a sprinkling of the chopped coriander – these are your Vietnamese meat-free mince meatball Christmas sarnies

### Step 8

Serve the Vietnamese meat-free mince meatball Christmas sarnie with the sage sweet potato chips and the shredded lettuce to the side
