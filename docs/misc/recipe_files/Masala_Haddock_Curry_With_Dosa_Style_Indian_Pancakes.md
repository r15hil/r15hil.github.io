### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based, non-stick pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cumin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Transfer the fragrant cumin seeds to a bowl with the gram flour and a generous pinch of salt, reserving the pan for later

Slowly whisk in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>cold water until smooth, then pour it into a measuring jug and set aside – this is your dosa-style batter

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Heat a large pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add half the sliced red onion (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Combine the remaining sliced red onion with the white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl and set aside – this is your pickled red onion

![Step 4 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-4-1636450762366-x200.jpg)

### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add a knob of butter with the chopped ginger, curry powder and garam masala

Cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Drain and rinse the green lentils

### Step 5

Dissolve the tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the spices are fragrant, add the tomato stock and drained green lentils to the pot and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened – this is your curry base

Meanwhile, return the reserved non-stick pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

### Step 6

Once hot, pour exactly 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1/4] </span>of the batter into the pan then lift the pan and tilt it in a circular motion so that the mixture spreads evenly over the base and cook for 4 min or until very set

Once set, use a spatula to carefully flip it over and cook for 3 min further – this is your dosa-style Indian pancake

Transfer to a plate and cover with tin foil then repeat for the final 1 <span class="text-danger">[3] </span>pancake<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1636450897888-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the curry base has thickened, add the spinach and haddock bites to the pot

Cook for 5 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the haddock is cooked through

Remove the curry from the heat and stir in half the natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your masala haddock curry

### Step 8

Combine the chopped tomato, grated carrot with the pickled red onion – this is your salad

Serve the masala haddock curry in a bowl topped with the remaining natural yoghurt

Serve the dosa-style Indian pancakes and salad to the side

Enjoy!
