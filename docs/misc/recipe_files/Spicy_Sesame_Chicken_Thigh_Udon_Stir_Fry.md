## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and chopped pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 6 min or until the chicken has browned


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), cornflour, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix until smooth – this is your spicy sesame sauce


### Step 5

Once the chicken is browned, add your ginger & garlic paste, grated carrot and udon noodles to the pan and cook for 2 min or until the carrot starts to soften

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!


### Step 6

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 7

Once the carrot has softened, add the spicy sesame sauce to the pan and cook for a final 2 min or until everything is warmed through, fully coated in the sauce and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy sesame chicken udon stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy sesame chicken udon stir-fry and garnish with the sliced spring onion and top with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
