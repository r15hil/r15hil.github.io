### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on)

### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem[s] and leaves

Cut a piece of tin foil (or two!) approx. the size of A3 paper

Lay the broccoli florets in the middle with your toasted sesame oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt and add to a baking tray

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the broccoli to form a<span class="text-danger"> </span>sealed parcel[s], then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender

### Step 3

Whilst the broccoli is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 4

Combine 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> cornflour (save the rest for later!), your soy sauce and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> water in a bowl and stir it all together

Add your Chinese rice wine and honey and give everything a good mix up – this is your honey sauce

### Step 5

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to a bowl with the remaining cornflour and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your golden chicken

### Step 6

Once the chicken is golden, transfer it to a plate and set aside for later

Carefully pour away most of the oil and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the honey sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thick and sticky

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2275-Step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, return the golden chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the chicken is coated in the sauce – this is your General Tso's free range chicken

### Step 8

Serve the General Tso's free range chicken over the cooked rice with the broccoli to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
