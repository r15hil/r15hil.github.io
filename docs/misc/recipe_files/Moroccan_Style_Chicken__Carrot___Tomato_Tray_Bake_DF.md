## Ingredients

- 320g British skin on chicken thighs
- 80g coconut yoghurt
- 30g sun-dried tomatoes
- 120g couscous
- 2 carrots
- 10g parsley & dill
- 1 tsp baharat
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 30g sultanas
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Combine the baharat, cumin seeds and ground cinnamon with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your spice rub


### Step 2

Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Top, tail, peel and cut the carrots into batons


### Step 3

Add the carrot batons, cherry tomatoes, red onion wedges and chicken thighs to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Pour over the spice rub and give everything a good mix up (clean hands are the best way!)

Make sure the chicken thighs are skin-side up on top of the other ingredients and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 4

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 50-60 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables are tender - this is your Moroccan-style chicken, carrot & tomato tray bake

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 5

Once the chicken and vegetables have been in the oven for 45 min, boil a kettle

Add the couscous, sun-dried tomatoes and sultanas to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiling water, cover and set aside


### Step 6

Chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped dill with the coconut yoghurt in a small bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your dairy-free dill yoghurt

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork – this is your sun-dried tomato & sultana couscous

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style chicken, carrot & tomato tray bake over the sun-dried tomato & sultana couscous

Dollop with the dairy-free dill yoghurt and sprinkle over the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
