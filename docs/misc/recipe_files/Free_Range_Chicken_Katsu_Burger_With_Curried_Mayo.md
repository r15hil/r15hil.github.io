- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Rice vinegar (15ml) x0
- Curry powder (1tbsp)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp) x0
- Ciabatta x2
- White potato
- Carrot
- Rice vinegar (30ml)

- Coriander (5g)
- Radishes (125g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Cut your white potato[es] and sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give it a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Combine your rice vinegar with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar in a large bowl

Add the grated carrot and sliced radish to the bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled slaw


### Step 3

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> flour and half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) to a plate and season with salt and pepper

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate


### Step 4

Coat your free range chicken breast portions in the flour mixture, tap off the excess, then add to the milk and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Tip: If your chicken is a bit too thick, slice it in half horizontally so you’re left with two thinner pieces


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 7-8 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken katsu


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add the remaining curry powder and stir for 30 secs, then transfer the curried butter to a bowl to cool

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty


### Step 7

Drain the liquid from the quick-pickled slaw and add the chopped coriander

Stir your mayo, mango chutney and white wine vinegar into the cooled curried butter – this is your curried mayo

Carefully slice the warmed ciabattas in half

### Step 8

To assemble, spread each warmed ciabatta base with some of the curried mayo, then top with the chicken katsu, some quick-pickled slaw, another dollop of curried mayo and the warmed ciabatta lid – this is your free range chicken katsu burger

Serve the fries and any remaining quick-pickled slaw to the side

Enjoy!
