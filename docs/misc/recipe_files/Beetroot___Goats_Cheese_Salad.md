### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your puy-style lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the puy-style lentils to a pot with plenty of cold water, bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot

### Step 3

Add the chopped beetroot and your butternut squash cubes to a tray (or two!), drizzle everything with olive oil and a season with a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then drizzle half of your honey (you'll use the rest later!) over the butternut squash cubes

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until everything is tender and golden

Chop your chives finely

Mix the chopped walnuts and chives together on the chopping board

### Step 5

Press your goats' cheese rounds into the chopped walnuts and chives

Tip: Apply a good amount of pressure so that the mix sticks to the cheese

Cover the coated goats' cheese with cling film and put it in the fridge until later

### Step 7

Once cooked, add the roasted butternut squash cubes and beetroot to the cooled lentils

Add half the honey-balsamic dressing (save the rest for later!) and mix it all up – these are your dressed vegetables

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Add the salad to a bowl

Break the coated goats' cheese into rough pieces and serve over the salad, along with the dressed vegetables

Drizzle over the remaining honey-balsamic dressing

Enjoy!
