### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Chop the potatoes into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and cooked through

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 3

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the grated cheddar with the soft cheese and chopped parsley

Season with a very generous grind of black pepper – this is your cheese mixture

### Step 4

Cut the cherry tomatoes in half

Add the cider vinegar to a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your dressing

Set both aside for serving

Once the onion has caramelised, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, then add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>milk and cook for a further 30 secs or until a thick paste has formed – this is your onion mixture

### Step 5

Transfer the onion mixture to the cheese mixture and give everything a good stir

Cut the puff pastry into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> rectangles and add them to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Divide the cheese & onion mixture between the pastry rectangles, covering only one half

### Step 6

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the mixture with as little air trapped inside as possible – these are your pasties

Prick air holes into the centre of the pasties evenly with a fork

### Step 7

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden and puffed up

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once everything's almost done, wash the baby leaf salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad leaves and halved cherry tomatoes to the bowl of dressing and gently mix together – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the caramelised onion & cheddar pasties with the wedges, dressed salad and mustard ketchup to the side

Enjoy!
