### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Combine your ground cumin, toasted sesame seeds, ground sumac and dried thyme in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your za'atar

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and brush with a generous drizzle of olive oil until the top is coated

Sprinkle the za'atar evenly all over and reserve the bowl

### Step 2

Crumble your Greek cheese over the coated pitta[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper

Drizzle half your honey over the top (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until starting to crisp

### Step 3

Cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate, then slice into quarters and add the pomegranate quarters to a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds

### Step 4

Combine your white wine vinegar, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? go easy!) and the remaining honey in the reserved bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your harissa dressing

### Step 5

Once the pitta[s] has had 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your walnuts to the other side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar to the walnuts

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3-4 min or until the walnuts are toasted and the pitta is crispy – this is your za'atar & Greek cheese manakeesh and toasted walnuts

### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1715674474237-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine the shredded lettuce, salad and most of your pomegranate seeds (save some for a garnish!) in a large bowl with half of the harissa dressing (you'll use the rest later!) and toss it all together – this is your harissa & pomegranate salad

### Step 8

Chop your za'atar & Greek cheese manakeesh into thin triangles

Serve the harissa & pomegranate salad topped with the za'atar & Greek cheese manakeesh triangles

Garnish with the remaining pomegranate seeds, toasted walnuts and the remaining harissa dressing

Enjoy!
