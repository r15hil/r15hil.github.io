Meanwhile, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into small pieces and add them to a medium bowl

Add 3/4 of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>soft cheese (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp] </span>cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good stir – this is your homemade stracciatella

Roughly chop the sun-dried tomatoes

### Step 7

Slice the ciabattas in half, then into triangles

Spread each ciabatta triangle with the sun-dried tomato mix, then add them to the other side of the baking tray with the softened tomatoes

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the ciabatta is slightly toasted – this is your sun-dried tomato toast

Wash the baby leaf salad and rocket and pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Divide the salad leaves between your serving plates and top with the roasted heritage beef tomato, spoon the homemade stracciatella into the roasted tomato

Garnish with the chopped tomato, walnuts and the reserved chopped basil, then drizzle over the dressing

Serve the sun-dried tomato toast to the side

Enjoy!
