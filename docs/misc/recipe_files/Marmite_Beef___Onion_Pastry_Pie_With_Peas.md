### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ gas 5

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Season the diced beef with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

### Step 2

Once hot, add the coated beef to the pan and cook for 5 min or until nicely browned all over

While the beef is browning, peel and quarter the shallots

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Top, tail, peel and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly

### Step 3

Transfer the browned beef to a clean plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped carrot and shallot quarters with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once slightly softened, add the chopped garlic with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min further or until softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the Marmite and beef stock mix with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Marmite stock

Return the browned beef and any juices to the pan with the Marmite stock – this is your Marmite beef & onion filling

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then transfer the Marmite beef & onion filling to an oven-proof dish, cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial hour or until the meat is tender

### Step 5

Remove the Marmite beef & onion filling from the oven after an initial hour and increase the heat to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Lay the puff pastry sheet over the pie dish and trim off any excess

Press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up and golden – this is your Marmite beef & onion pie

Peel and chop the potatoes into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 7

Reboil half a kettle

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth

Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 8

Serve the Marmite beef & onion pie with the mashed potato and refreshed peas to the side

Enjoy!
