## Ingredients

- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 1 tomato
- 32g tomato paste
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 160g quick cook spaghetti
- 40g cheddar flavour block

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free mince and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and chop (or grate!) the garlic

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>


### Step 4

Once the meat-free mince has browned, add the diced shallot, chopped garlic, chopped tomato and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min further or until the shallot is slightly softened


### Step 5

Add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, Marmite, tomato paste and Henderson's Relish in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 7

Once the shallot has slightly softened, add the tomato stock, dried oregano, a splash of starchy pasta water and a very good grind of black pepper to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened to a rich, bolognese-like consistency – this is your plant-based bolognese ragù

Grate the cheddar flavour block

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based bolognese ragù over the spaghetti

Top with the grated cheeze

Enjoy!
