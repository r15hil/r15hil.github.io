### Step 3

Add the halloumi slices to a baking tray

Drizzle with vegetable oil and sprinkle over the smoked paprika

Put the tray directly under the grill for 4-5 min or until warmed through and softened – this is your smoky halloumi

Chop the coriander leaves and cherry tomatoes together until combined

### Step 6

Combine the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and natural yoghurt in a small bowl – this is your chipotle yoghurt

Add the tortillas to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

Garnish with the lime wedges and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
