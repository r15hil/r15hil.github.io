## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Bash your coconut flakes in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don’t lose any!)


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, transfer the toasted coconut flakes to a bowl, reserve the pan

Add the chopped mint to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut crumb


### Step 5

Add your basmati rice and grated carrot to a pot with a lid with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat, mix through your chopped dates and keep covered until serving – this is your date rice


### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with your chopped ginger, garam masala and ground turmeric

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato to the pan with the tomato stock and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened

Once thickened, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through – this is your mild king prawn curry

### Step 8

Serve the mild king prawn curry over the date rice

Garnish with the coconut crumb
