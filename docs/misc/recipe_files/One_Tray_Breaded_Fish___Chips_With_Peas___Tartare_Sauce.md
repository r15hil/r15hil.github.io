## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Basa fillet x0
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Capers (20g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- White potato x3
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Parsley (5g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips


### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your capers roughly


### Step 4

Add your chopped capers to a bowl with your mayo, a squeeze of your lemon, most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and a grind of black pepper

Stir it all together – this is your tartare sauce


### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and sprinkle each side with your vegetable stock mix


### Step 6

Once your chips have had an initial 15 min, move them to one side of the baking tray[s] and add the seasoned basa to the other side

Top the seasoned basa with your panko breadcrumbs (pile them on for extra crunch!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the basa and season with salt and pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min further or until the breadcrumbs are brown and crispy and the fish is cooked through – this is your one tray breaded fish & chips


### Step 7

Once everything is nearly ready, boil half a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the one tray breaded fish & chips with the blanched peas and tartare sauce to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
