## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 150g Greek-style yoghurt
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 50g diced apricots 
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander 
- 1 British chicken breast fillet
- 120g couscous
- 1 red pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into wedges, keeping the peel on (this helps it cook quicker)


Add the onion wedges to a baking tray, drizzle with a little vegetable oil and season them with a pinch of salt


Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until they're tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine the ground cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika, dried oregano and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;black pepper&nbsp;and a very large pinch of salt on a plate


Mix all the spices together &ndash; this is your Cajun seasoning&nbsp;


### Step 3

Boil a kettle


Cut the&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into strips


Add the chicken strips to your Cajun seasoning and make sure they're fully coated in the spices&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water in a large heatproof bowl&nbsp;


Add the couscous and diced apricots to the bowl, cover with a tea towel or plate and set aside &ndash; this is your apricot couscous


Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


### Step 5

Cut the green beans in half&nbsp;


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the Cajun spiced chicken,&nbsp;green beans and red pepper&nbsp;and cook for 3 min, turning once halfway through


Add a splash of water to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for a further 2 min


### Step 6

Meanwhile, season the Greek-style yoghurt with salt and pepper, add a drizzle of olive oil and mix well &ndash; this is your seasoned yoghurt


Remove the roasted onion wedges from the oven and carefully remove the skins by cutting off the root ends &ndash; you'll end up with onion 'petals'


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat, add the red wine vinegar and mix to combine


Fluff the apricot&nbsp;couscous with a fork


Carefully combine the cooked Cajun chicken,&nbsp;green beans and red pepper with the fluffed&nbsp;apricot couscous and onion petals&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the Cajun Chicken Couscous with a dollop of the seasoned yoghurt&nbsp;


Enjoy!
