Cook for 30 secs or until the grains are coated in the spices

Add 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water and your sultanas and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sultana rice
