## Description

Hambagu, pronounced ham-ba-goo, is what the Japanese call their version of a hamburger. It's bunless and comes with plenty of rich, sticky sauce. We're serving ours over nutty brown rice with spinach gomaae (sesame spinach). Japan-easy! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

## Ingredients

- 150g baby leaf spinach 
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 3 tomato ketchup sachets (45ml)
- 250g British beef mince
- 130g brown rice 
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 1 beef stock cube
- 25g honey 
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp Henderson's relish
- 1 spring onion
- 3 soy sauce sachets (24ml)
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Peel and grate the brown&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


### Step 3

Add the grated onion, beef mince and panko breadcrumbs to a large bowl&nbsp;


Crumble the beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the bowl and knead thoroughly with clean hands for 2-3 min


Once smooth, divide the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into oval-shaped burgers &ndash; these are your hambagu&nbsp;


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the hambagu and cook for 6-7 min on each side until they're cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Add the baby&nbsp;leaf&nbsp;spinach&nbsp;to a colander and pour&nbsp;over&nbsp;the&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;so that it starts to wilt


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Add the wilted spinach, toasted&nbsp;sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and a pinch of salt to a medium bowl and give everything a good mix up &ndash; this is your spinach gomaae


### Step 7

Once the hambagu are cooked, transfer them to a plate and leave them to rest


Pour away most of the oil, leaving around 1 tsp<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[2 tsp]&nbsp;</span>in the pan


Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add the soy sauce, ketchup, Henderson's Relish and honey to the pan


Cook for 30 sec, whisking constantly&nbsp;&ndash; this is your umami sauce&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the hambagu over the brown rice and drizzle with umami sauce with the&nbsp;spinach gomaae to the side&nbsp;


Garnish with the sliced spring onion


Enjoy!
