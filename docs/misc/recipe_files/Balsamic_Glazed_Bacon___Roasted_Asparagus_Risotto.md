## Ingredients

- Arborio rice (160g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (90g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (45g) x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Tomato
- Rocket (50g)
- Asparagus spears (120g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop half your smoked streaky bacon finely (you'll use the rest later!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the bacon is starting to crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped onion to the pan with a knob of butter

Cook for 4 min or until the onion has softened


### Step 3

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and Chinese rice wine in 750ml<span class="text-purple"> [975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

While the risotto is cooking, line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add the remaining bacon to the tray and drizzle over half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up until the bacon is well coated


### Step 5

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus

Chop the asparagus into bite-sized pieces and add it to the tray with the bacon with a little olive oil and a pinch of salt

When the risotto has 10 min remaining, put the tray in the oven and cook for 8-10 min or until the bacon is crispy and the asparagus is tender – this is your balsamic glazed bacon & roasted asparagus


### Step 6

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the salad and chopped tomato in a bowl with the remaining balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your salad


### Step 7

Once the risotto is ready, stir through 3/4 of your grated Italian hard cheese and a generous grind of pepper – this is your bacon risotto

Combine the balsamic glazed bacon & roasted asparagus with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese – this is your balsamic glazed bacon & asparagus topping

### Step 8

Serve the balsamic bacon & asparagus topping over the bacon risotto with the salad to the side

Enjoy!
