## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 130g basmati rice
- 2 x 120g pollock fillets
- 210g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 80g Cornish clotted cream
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion
- 30g sultanas

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a pot with a lid over a medium heat

Once hot, add the basmati rice with a pinch of ground turmeric (save the rest for later!)

Cook for 30 secs or until the grains are coated in the spices


### Step 2

Add 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and the sultanas and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sultana rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

While the onions are cooking, cut the pollock fillets into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add the chopped pollock and cook for 1-2 min

Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, chopped tomatoes, remaining ground turmeric, tomato paste and garam masala to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Stir in the vegetable stock mix, then add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min further or until the pollock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the clotted cream – this is your mild pollock curry

### Step 8

Serve the mild pollock curry over the sultana rice and enjoy!
