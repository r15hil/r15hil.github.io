### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, ground turmeric, chopped garlic and ginger

Add most of the chopped chilli to the pan (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and save the rest for garnish

Cook for 2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Chop your chopped creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the creamed coconut and your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy vegetable stock

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Break up your crab meat gently with a fork, then add to the pan with the creamy vegetable stock and spinach, then give everything a good mix up

Add the juice of half your lime[s] with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Pick your coriander leaves from their stalks and set aside

Chop the coriander stalks finely

Once the prawns are cooked, stir the chopped coriander stalks through the sauce – this is your Sri Lankan-style crab & king prawn curry

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style crab & king prawn curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top with the coriander leaves and reserved chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Garnish with a lime wedge and enjoy!
