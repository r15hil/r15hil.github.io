## Ingredients

- Gem lettuce
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Tomato x2
- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your chips


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your onion[s]

Add the sliced onion to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

Peel and finely grate your garlic


### Step 3

Add your chicken breast portion[s] and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, drain the sliced red onion in a sieve and run under cold water until cooled

Return the drained onion to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix it all together and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled onion


### Step 5

Combine your mayo and remaining grated garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) in a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic mayo

Wash your lettuce[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then chop roughly


### Step 6

Add the shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and chopped cucumber to a separate bowl with the quick-pickled onion and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled onion salad


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, add to a clean board and slice finely – this is your sliced chicken shawarma

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken shawarma over the quick-pickled onion salad with the chips to the side

Drizzle over the garlic mayo

Enjoy!
