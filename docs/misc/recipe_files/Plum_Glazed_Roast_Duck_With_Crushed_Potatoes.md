## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your baking trays and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Separate your duck leg[s] from the white duck fat and duck jelly (you'll use these in different parts of the recipe!)


### Step 3

Add the duck leg[s], Chantenay carrots and waxy potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Top your potatoes and carrots with the duck fat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until the duck leg[s] is golden and crispy and the potatoes are tender


### Step 4

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 5

When the duck has about 5 min cooking time left, boil a kettle

Add the duck jelly to a measuring jug with your chicken stock mix and cornflour

Mix until fully combined, then stir in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [195ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [275ml]</span> boiled water, a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – this is your gravy mix


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender and the duck is golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven and spread your spiced plum chutney over the duck

Return to the oven for a final 2-3 min or until caramelised – this is your plum glazed roast duck

Meanwhile, put the gravy mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring halfway – this is your gravy


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Crush the potatoes firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a mug

Add a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your crushed potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the plum glazed roast duck with the crushed potatoes, roast carrots and peas to the side

Pour over the gravy and season with a generous pinch of pepper

Dig in!
