### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the tofu into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> slices

Combine 2/3 of the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a large bowl, add the tofu slices

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinade

### Step 2

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Add the marinated tofu to a baking tray with any remaining soy sauce from the bowl, sprinkle over the black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crisp – this is your sesame-crusted tofu

Heat a small, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger and curry powder and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant
