### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways

Bash the halved cucumber with a rolling pin then slice into bite-sized chunks – this is your smashed cucumber

### Step 3

Combine the smashed cucumber and rice vinegar in a small bowl with your toasted sesame seeds, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a little drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your sesame smashed cucumber

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and cornflour to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] in half lengthways, then chop roughly

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 6

Once the lamb has started to brown, add the chopped spring onion to the pan with the chopped garlic, ground cumin, tomato paste and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your gluten free soy sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 1-2 min or until everything is fully combined and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy cumin lamb

Drain the sesame smashed cucumber, reserving the pickling liquid

### Step 8

Serve the spicy cumin lamb with the cooked rice and sesame smashed cucumber to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Drizzle the reserved pickling liquid over the cooked rice

Enjoy!
