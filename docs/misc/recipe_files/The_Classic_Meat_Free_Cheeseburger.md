## Ingredients

- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Tomato
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- Tomato ketchup (30ml)
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Peel your red onion[s] and slice finely into rounds


### Step 3

Add the onion rounds to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray (or pop them on the tray with the chips if you have space!) and drizzle them with a little olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and lightly golden


### Step 4

Meanwhile, break up your ultimate vegan burger patties into a bowl

Add your dried oregano, Henderson's Relish and a good grind of black pepper

Mix together until really well combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape the meat-free mixture into 1 patty per person


### Step 5

Cut 2 thin slices per person from your tomato[es] and set them aside for serving

Chop the remaining tomato[es] roughly

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper then remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside until serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces

Slice your cheddar cheese into 3 slices per person


### Step 6

Once the chips have been cooking for 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the meat-free patty[ies] and cook for 5 min on one side, then flip and cook for a further 2 min or until starting to brown

Mix the torn lettuce and roughly chopped tomato together – this is your salad


### Step 7

Top the meat-free patty[ies] with the cheese slices and cook, covered, for a further 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the patty[ies] is cooked through

Meanwhile, slice your brioche bun[s] in half and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build your burger top your warmed brioche bun base with a squeeze of tomato ketchup, a reserved lettuce leaf, tomato slices, a cheesy meat-free patty, roasted onion rounds and the warmed brioche bun lid

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
