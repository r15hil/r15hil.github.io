Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your yellow mustard seeds, cumin seeds and chopped paneer to the pan and cook for 3-5 min or until the paneer is golden

Once golden, transfer everything to a plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium-high heat, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric and tomato paste and cook for 5-6 min further or until the onion has caramelised

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

### Step 6

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your cracked black pepper and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the vegetable stock and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce is beginning to thicken

Once beginning to thicken, return the cooked paneer to the pan and cook for 2 min further or until warmed through – this is your Chettinad-style paneer curry

### Step 7

While the sauce is thickening, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the naan[s] once they are warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the Chettinad-style paneer curry with the basmati rice and warmed naans to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
