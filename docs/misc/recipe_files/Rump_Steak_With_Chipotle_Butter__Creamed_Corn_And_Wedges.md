- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Tomato
- British rump pavé steak (300g)
- Courgette
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- White potato x3
- Coriander & mint (10g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle, then take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes and chop them into wedges, add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12 min, then drain and shake them around in the colander to fluff up the edges before baking, reserve the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into thick discs on a diagonal, then chop your tomato[es] into wedges and add to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add a knob of butter to a heatproof bowl and put it in the microwave for 10 secs or until slightly softened (not melted!)


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems, then chop most of the mint leaves and coriander as finely as you can (save some whole leaves for garnish!)

Combine the chopped herbs and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with the softened butter and mix until combined – this is your herby butter


### Step 4

Gradually add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the herby butter with the juice of half your lime[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your chipotle butter

Put the chipotle butter in the fridge to cool, then reboil half a kettle

Add the parboiled wedges to the other side of the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and add to the oven for 25 min or until crispy and golden


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your sweetcorn

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the remaining garlic and ground cumin and cook for 1 min or until the garlic is fragrant

Add the drained sweetcorn to the pot with your soft cheese and 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened, then remove from the heat and set aside until later – this is your creamed corn base


### Step 6

Season the rump steak[s] all over with salt and pepper

When the wedges have 15 min left, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once very hot, add the rump steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 7

Once the steak[s] is cooked, add half the chipotle butter (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan, and once melted, spoon the chipotle butter over the steak[s]

Once done, transfer to a clean board to rest

Return the creamed corn base to a medium heat and once hot, stir through your grated Italian hard cheese until melted

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your creamed corn

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges and slice the rested chipotle steak[s] finely

Serve the sliced chipotle steak over the creamed corn with the potato wedges and roasted courgette & tomato to the side

Top the sliced chipotle steak with the remaining chipotle butter, sprinkle over the reserved herbs and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
