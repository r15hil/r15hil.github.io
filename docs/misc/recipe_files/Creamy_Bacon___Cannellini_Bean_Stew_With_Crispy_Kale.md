## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180ºC/ 160ºC (fan)/ 350ºF/ Gas 4


Boil a kettle


Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger"> </span>carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


Dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 550ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat


Once melted, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Once the leek has softened, add the chicken stock and chopped potatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the shredded kale to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt 


Massage the oil into the kale until it's evenly coated


Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until turning golden and crisp 


Meanwhile, drain and rinse the cannellini beans


### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the smoked streaky bacon and cook for 5 min, turning once halfway until golden and crisp


Once done, transfer the bacon to kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add the cannellini beans and soft cheese and cook for 2 min further, stirring until everything is warmed through


Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and season with a generous pinch of salt and grind of black pepper – this is your creamy leek, potato &amp; bean stew

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


Chop the bacon roughly 


Serve the creamy leek, potato &amp; bean stew topped with the crispy kale and bacon


Garnish with a wedge of lemon


Enjoy!
