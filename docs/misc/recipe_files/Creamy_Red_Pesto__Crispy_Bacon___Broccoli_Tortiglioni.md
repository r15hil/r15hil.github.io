## Ingredients

- Tortiglioni (200g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (160g)
- British bacon lardons (50g) x0
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g)
- British bacon lardons (100g)
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Sun-dried tomato nut pesto (45g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for an initial 8-10 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 4

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp

Once done, transfer the bacon to kitchen paper and set aside, reserve the pan – this is your crispy bacon


### Step 5

Once the tortiglioni has had 8-10 min, add the halved Tenderstem broccoli and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the broccoli is tender and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Once done, drain the tortiglioni and broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Return the reserved bacon pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add your tomato paste, pesto and soft cheese

Season to taste, adding a pinch of salt and pepper if needed and cook for 1 min or until fully combined – this is your creamy red pesto sauce


### Step 7

Add the drained tortiglioni and Tenderstem broccoli to the creamy red pesto sauce with a splash of the starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your creamy red pesto & broccoli tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy red pesto & broccoli tortiglioni

Top with the crispy bacon, grated cheddar and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
