## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Grate your sweetcorn cobettes coarsely

Tip: Grate the cobettes right down to the core!


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop you creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once slightly softened, add your ginger & garlic paste with your ground coriander, ground cumin and garam masala and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the grated sweetcorn and cook for 2-3 min or until the sweetcorn is slightly creamy

Add the drained chickpeas and coconut stock with a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for a further 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly


### Step 6

While the curry is cooking, finely dice your tomatoes

Chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish!)

Combine the diced tomatoes and chopped coriander in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato & coriander salad


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop it roughly

Stir the chopped spinach through the curry and stir it all together for 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your sweetcorn chana curry

### Step 8

Serve the sweetcorn chana curry over the basmati rice with the tomato & coriander salad to the side

Top with a dollop of mango chutney and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
