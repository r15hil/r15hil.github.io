### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your dried thyme (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden – these are your herby potatoes

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate, then combine your panko breadcrumbs with the remaining dried thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper on a large plate

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them to the milk and then firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5 min on each side or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the outside is golden

On a clean board, slice the breaded chicken finely into strips – this is your crispy chicken

### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then add to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop them up as finely as you can!

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1696938063768-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the chopped sprouts to a medium bowl with your dried cranberries, half your mayo (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your sprout slaw

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1696938067954-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, put your bao buns on a plate and cover them, then microwave for 15-20 secs

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the crispy chicken and top with the remaining mayo, cranberry sauce and crispy onions – these are your crispy chicken & cranberry bao buns

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chicken & cranberry bao buns with the herby potatoes and sprout slaw to the side

Enjoy!
