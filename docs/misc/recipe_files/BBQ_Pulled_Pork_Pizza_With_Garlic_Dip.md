### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with your BBQ sauce and 5 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [7 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [10 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your BBQ base


### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add your BBQ pulled pork to a clean chopping board and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Transfer the chopped BBQ pork to a bowl with the juices and mix it all together – this is your BBQ pork


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the BBQ base between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over with the back of a spoon, then top with the BBQ pork

Top with the torn mozzarella and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crispy – this is your BBQ pork pizza[s]


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with your mayo, dried oregano and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your garlic dip


### Step 7

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 8

Top the BBQ pork pizza[s] with the sliced spring onion and serve with the wedges and garlic dip to the side

Enjoy!
