Add the drained lentils, dried basil, soft cheese and half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy lentil & tomato stuffed flat white mushrooms with the salad to the side

Drizzle the dressing over the salad and garnish with your pumpkin seeds
