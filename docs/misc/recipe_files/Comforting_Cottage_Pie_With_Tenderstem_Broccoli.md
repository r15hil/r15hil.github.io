### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, carrot and garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and stir in the Marmite – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the vegetables have softened, add the beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Grate the cheddar cheese

Once the beef is browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened – this is your beef mixture

While the beef mixture thickens, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a large knob of butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth

### Step 6

Once the beef mixture has thickened, transfer it to an oven-proof dish

Top with the mashed potato and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your cottage pie

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and season with a pinch of salt
