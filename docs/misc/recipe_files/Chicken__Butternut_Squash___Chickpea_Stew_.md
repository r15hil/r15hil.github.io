## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a<span class="text-danger"> </span>kettle

Meanwhile, dissolve half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) in 200ml [<span class="text-purple">300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof bowl

Add your couscous to the stock, stir, cover and set aside


### Step 3

Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave for 5-6 min or until the squash cubes are fork-tender

Dissolve the remaining chicken stock mix with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast and roasted garlic paste with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min

Add your smoked paprika, ground cinnamon, turmeric, cumin and coriander to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes, remaining chicken stock mix, drained chickpeas, spinach, cooked butternut squash and a pinch of sugar to the pan

Cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken, butternut squash & chickpea stew


### Step 7

Meanwhile, fluff the couscous with a fork and add a generous drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the chicken, butternut squash & chickpea stew over the fluffy couscous

Enjoy!
