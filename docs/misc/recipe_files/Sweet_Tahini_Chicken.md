Set aside for step 3


### Step 2

Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon and slice finely

Put the onion and cucumber in a bowl, sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, mix well and set aside


### Step 3

Boil a kettle (used in step 4)


Grill the chicken thighs for 12-14 min or until cooked through


Tip: You want the thighs to be slightly charred to accentuate the flavours of the baharat


### Step 4

Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the couscous and cook with the lid on for 6-8 min or until tender, then drain


Peel and chop the garlic finely


Chop the mint finely

### Step 6

Once the couscous is ready, take small handfuls of the onion and cucumber and squeeze out the excess liquid


Tip: A lot of water will have been drawn out by the salt so squeeze quite hard


### Step 7

Mix together the couscous, onion, cucumber, mint (saving a pinch for garnish) and half the dressing

### Step 8

Serve the chicken on a bed of couscous, top with a dollop of sweet tahini dressing and the remaining mint
