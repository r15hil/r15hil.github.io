### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into rough bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and onion wedges and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken is browned all over and the onion is starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, strip your coriander leaves from the stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Add your Thai green curry paste and soy sauce – this is your Thai green curry sauce


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped coriander stalks and cook for 1 min

Trim your Tenderstem broccoli

Add the Tenderstem broccoli, sugar snap peas and Thai green curry sauce and cook, covered, for an initial 2-3 min


### Step 6

After an initial 2-3 min, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan

Cook for a further 4-5 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), the prawns are cooked through and the vegetables are tender – this is your chicken & king prawn Thai green curry


### Step 7

Roughly chop your reserved coriander leaves

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & king prawn Thai green curry

Garnish with the chopped coriander leaves and roasted peanuts

Enjoy!
