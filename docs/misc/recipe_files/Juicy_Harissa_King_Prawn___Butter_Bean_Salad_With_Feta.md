### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your honey harissa dressing

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Mix everything together, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your juicy harissa king prawns
