## Ingredients

- Spring onion x2
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Gnocchi (350g)
- Mangetout (80g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Slice your mangetout in half lengthways


### Step 2

Add your gnocchi, chopped Tenderstem broccoli, halved green beans and sliced mangetout to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3 min or until the gnocchi begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain everything


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim, then chop your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained gnocchi, Tenderstem broccoli, sliced mangetout and green beans with the chopped spring onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel half your Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese finely


### Step 6

Once the gnocchi has crisped, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter to the pan with the juice of half your lemon[s]

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the butter has melted – this is your lemony green veg gnocchi


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the lemony green veg gnocchi topped with the grated Italian hard cheese and cheese shavings

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
