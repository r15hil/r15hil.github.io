### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle, then heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add half of your vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) to a large heatproof bowl with your diced apricots and couscous

Once the kettle has boiled, add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water, stir, cover and set aside – this is your fruity couscous

### Step 3

Meanwhile, once the pan is hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add your baharat, roasted garlic paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Once fragrant, add the tomato paste, chopped dates, 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water and the remaining vegetable stock mix

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a stew-like consistency

### Step 5

Once thickened, add the drained chickpeas and cook for another 1 min or until the chickpeas are warmed through – this is your baharat meat-free mince stew

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 6

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them roughly and discard the stems

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

### Step 7

Fluff up the fruity couscous with a fork, then add a pinch of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the baharat meat-free mince stew alongside the fruity couscous and top with your yoghurt

Garnish with the chopped mint and parsley

Enjoy!
