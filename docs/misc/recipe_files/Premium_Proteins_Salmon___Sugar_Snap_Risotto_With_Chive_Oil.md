- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Arborio rice (160g)
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Skin on salmon fillets (2pcs)
- Chives (5g)
- Sugar snap peas (80g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 2

While the onion softens, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains of rice in the oil

Add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, carefully peel and discard the skin then flake the cooked salmon gently with a fork and keep warm


### Step 5

Slice your lemon[s] into quarters

Chop your sugar snap peas in half

Chop your chives finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Add the chopped chives, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice to a pestle & mortar

Grind everything until you're left with a green oil – this is your chive oil

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!


### Step 7

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the halved sugar snap peas to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further

Remove the cooked risotto from the heat and stir through the grated cheese with a large knob of butter

Add the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon quarter[s] and season very generously with pepper – this is your sugar snap risotto

Tip: Add a splash more water if your risotto is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Slice the remaining lemon quarter[s] in half

Serve the sugar snap risotto, topped with the flaked salmon and a drizzle of chive oil

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
