### Step 3

Add a large piece of tin foil to the other side of the baking tray, leaving enough excess to fold over on itself to form a parcel

Add the chopped potato and onion wedges to the centre of the tin foil and pour over the braising liquid

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Divide all the ingredients equally between the 2 trays!

Fold the foil over the top scrunching it together to form one big parcel

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 30 min

### Step 6

After an initial 30 min, remove the tray from the oven and set aside the pork belly

Add the carrot discs, chopped pepper and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the baking tray and give everything a good mix up

Place your pork belly on top of the vegetables and return the tray to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until the veg is tender and the pork belly is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your roasted pork belly, gamja jorim & spicy roasted veg

Slice the rested pork belly

### Step 8

Serve the pork belly slices with the gamja jorim and spicy roasted veg to the side

Enjoy!
