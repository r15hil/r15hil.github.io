Top, tail, peel and finely chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Once the onion and carrot are beginning to soften, add the lean beef mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min further or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

While the lean beef mince is cooking, add the spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot until serving

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix and soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 6

Add the chopped garlic, tomato paste, stock, chopped tomatoes, dried basil and dried oregano to the pan

Season with a grind of black pepper, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened – this is your lean beef bolognese

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Grate the Italian hard cheese

### Step 8

Serve the lean beef bolognese over the spaghetti

Top with the grated Italian hard cheese and chopped parsley and enjoy!
