### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Drain and rinse your red kidney beans, butter beans and black beans all together

### Step 3

Add the drained beans to the dish with your ground smoked paprika, cumin seeds, chopped tomatoes and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and give everything a good mix

### Step 4

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Add the crushed garlic to the dish with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 5

Add your potatoes to a large baking tray (or two!) and prick them a few times with a sharp knife

Drizzle them with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 6

Cover the casserole dish with a lid and put it in the oven with the tray[s] of potatoes for 45-50 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and the chilli has thickened – this is your oven baked three bean chilli and your jacket potatoes

### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice your green chilli[es] roughly

Add the sliced chilli to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled green chilli

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Garnish the oven baked three bean chilli with the quick-pickled green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and chopped coriander

Serve with the jacket potatoes to the side

Dig in!
