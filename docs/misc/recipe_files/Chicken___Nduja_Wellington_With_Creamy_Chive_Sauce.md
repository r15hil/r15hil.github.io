### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop the tomatoes in half

Add the waxy potatoes and halved tomatoes to an oven-proof dish, drizzle with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 25 min

### Step 2

Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of the chicken breast portions (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Fill the pockets with the 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), then season generously with salt and pepper – these are your 'Nduja stuffed chicken breasts

### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> rectangles

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

### Step 4

Wrap each ‘Nduja stuffed chicken breast in a pastry rectangle, sealing the ends with a fork to form 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> parcels

Drizzle each parcel with olive oil

Add the parcels to the baking paper-lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken & 'Nduja Wellingtons

### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim the green beans

Chop the chives finely

Finely chop (or grate!) the garlic

### Step 6

Once the veg has had an initial 25 min, remove the dish from the oven and crush the roasted tomatoes with a fork to release the juice

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1657621907858-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the trimmed green beans, double cream, chicken stock mix and chopped garlic to the dish and cook for 10 min further or until the potatoes are cooked through and the green beans are tender

Once done, sprinkle over most of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your creamy chive roasted veg

### Step 8

To serve, slice the chicken & 'Nduja Wellington in half

Serve the creamy chive roasted veg to the side, spoon over any remaining creamy chive sauce and garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
