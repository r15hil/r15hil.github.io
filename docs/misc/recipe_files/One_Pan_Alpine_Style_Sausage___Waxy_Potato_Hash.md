Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and onion wedges to the pan and cook for 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, crush them lightly with a fork in the bowl – these are your crushed potatoes

Add your salad to the mustard dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the one-pan Alpine-style sausage & waxy potato hash with the dressed salad to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
