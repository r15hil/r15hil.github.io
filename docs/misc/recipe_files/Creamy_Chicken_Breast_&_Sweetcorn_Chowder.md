### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat

Transfer the browned chicken to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 2

While the chicken is browning, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Boil a kettle

### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add a knob of butter with the chopped onion, half your smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until the onion has softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min

### Step 4

While the onion is softening, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped potatoes, browned chicken, thyme (chuck it in, stalks and all!) and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min or until the Chinese rice wine has evaporated

Add the chicken stock and a generous pinch of salt, and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling reduce to medium and cook for an initial 10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 6

Meanwhile, drain your sweetcorn

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

After an initial 10 min, add the drained sweetcorn and spinach to the pan for a final 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, stir through your soft cheese with a good grind of black pepper – this is your creamy chicken breast & sweetcorn chowder

Discard the thyme stalks and shred any larger pieces of chicken apart, using two forks

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken breast & sweetcorn chowder in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining smoked paprika

Season with a generous grind of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
