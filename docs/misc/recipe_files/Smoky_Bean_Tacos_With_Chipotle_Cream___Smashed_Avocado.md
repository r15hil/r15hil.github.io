## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Slice your sweet pointed pepper[s] into rings

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once your pan is hot, add the sliced pepper and cook for 3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

While the pepper is softening, boil half a kettle

Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with your soured cream and give it a good mix up – this is your chipotle cream


### Step 4

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 5

Add the drained black beans, your tomato paste, ground cumin and ground smoked paprika to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add your soy sauce, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until thickened – these are your smoky beans


### Step 6

While the smoky beans are cooking, add your tortillas to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Add a squeeze of your lime[s] into the smoky beans

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

### Step 8

Divide the smoky beans between the warmed tortillas and top with the shredded lettuce and your smashed avocado

Drizzle over the chipotle cream

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
