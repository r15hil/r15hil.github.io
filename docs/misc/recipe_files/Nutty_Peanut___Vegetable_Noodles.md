- 32ml soy sauce

### Step 1

Soak the Thai rice&nbsp;noodles in cold water, so they're fully submerged and set them aside to soften&nbsp;


Boil a kettle

### Step 2

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into quarters


Peel, top and tail, and cut the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into thin batons


Deseed the red&nbsp;pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces


Slice the mange tout into thin strips


<span style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span>


### Step 3

Combine the peanut butter with the soy sauce, honey, toasted sesame oil, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;boiled water


Mix&nbsp;to form a smooth paste &ndash; this is your peanut sauce


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a matching lid, with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the carrot batons&nbsp;and pepper&nbsp;and stir-fry for 4 min or until starting to brown


Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high &nbsp;


### Step 5

Drain&nbsp;the soaked noodles, separate them and lay them flat in the pan, so they don't stick together


Add 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water and cover with a lid


Cook for 5-7 min or until the noodles have softened, then remove the lid


Tip:&nbsp;shake the pan or stir occasionally to prevent the noodles from sticking


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the roasted&nbsp;peanuts coarsely (or bash them in a bag)


Trim then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 7

Add the sliced mange tout to the noodles and cook for a further 2 min


Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the peanut sauce, half of the chopped&nbsp;peanuts and half of the&nbsp;sliced spring onion &ndash;&nbsp;these are your nutty vegetable noodles&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the nutty vegetable&nbsp;noodles and garnish with the remaining spring onion, peanuts and lime wedges


Enjoy!
