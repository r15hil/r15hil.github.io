### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Top, tail then slice your courgette[s] into rounds

Add the pepper strips and courgette rounds to a baking tray (or two!) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

### Step 2

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – this is your roasted veg

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

### Step 3

Add your bulgur wheat and diced apricots to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

### Step 4

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

Add your basa fillet[s] to a separate plate with the ras el hanout and rub until fully coated

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Once hot, add the coated basa fillets with a pinch of salt and a couple of splashes of cold water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped parsley and mint (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked bulgur wheat and give it a good mix up – this is your herby bulgur

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1630426552178-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the fish is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and return the pan and any remaining juices to a low heat

Add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the pan and mix it all together

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your warm harissa dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the spiced basa with the herby bulgur, roasted veg and shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the warm harissa dressing all over

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, a lemon wedge and the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Enjoy!
