### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and umami seasoning and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, remove the pan from the heat and set aside

### Step 2

Whilst the meat-free mince is cooking, put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel and slice your shallot[s] as thinly as you can

Grate your cheddar flavour block[s]

### Step 3

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base

### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the tomato base between your pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the meat-free mince and grated cheeze

Tip: Make sure the pizza[s] don’t overlap on the tray[s] to avoid raw dough!
