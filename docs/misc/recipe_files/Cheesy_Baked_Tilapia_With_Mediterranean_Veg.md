This dishy dinner is inspired by the Mediterranean sun. While the fish and potatoes brown in the oven, you'll braise colourful veg to serve alongside. What a catch!

## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 2 x 120g tilapia fillets
- 16g tomato paste
- 1 courgette
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 3 white potatoes
- 10g basil
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add to a tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your roast potatoes


### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the oven, boil half a kettle

Peel and chop the red onions roughly

Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into bite-sized pieces

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Grate the cheddar cheese into a bowl, add the panko breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy breadcrumb mix


### Step 4

Pat the tilapia fillets dry with kitchen paper and add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb mix over the fillets until they're totally covered

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min, or until the breadcrumb mixture is starting to turn golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your cheesy baked tilapia

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

While the tilapia is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened


### Step 6

Add the vegetable stock and cook for 1-2 min further

Season generously with salt and pepper – this is your Mediterranean veg


### Step 7

Once done, tear the basil into your Mediterranean veg

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy baked tilapia over the Mediterranean veg with the roast potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
