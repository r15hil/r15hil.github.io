## Ingredients

- Dried sage (1tsp)
- Spinach (80g)
- Sausage meat (150g)
- Dijon mustard (18g)
- British pork belly (150g) x0
- Gravy base (14g)
- British pork belly (300g)
- Carrot x2
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern


### Step 2

Flip the scored pork over and rub your Dijon mustard all over the non-fatty side with your dried sage and a generous grind of pepper


### Step 3

Cut 2 pieces of tin foil approx. the size of A4 paper and lay the pork (fatty-side up), in the middle of the foil, (doubling it up prevents any leakages!)

Loosely scrunch the edges of the foil around the pork leaving the skin exposed and transfer the parcel[s] to a baking tray (or two!)

Pour 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water around the pork

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 30 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel your potatoes, then chop in half

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Add the sliced carrot and halved potatoes to a large heat-proof bowl covered with cling film

Put the bowl in the microwave for 5-8 min or until slightly tender, then remove the cling film and set aside


### Step 5

Divide your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and shape into 3 stuffing meatballs per person

Once the pork has had 30 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the carrot and potatoes (reserve the bowl!) with the stuffing meatballs and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 18-20 min or until the pork belly skin is crisp and tender and the sausage stuffing is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the pork is ready, remove the tray[s] from the oven and transfer the roasted pork belly to a clean chopping board to rest for 2-3 min

Add the spinach to the tray[s] and combine with the roasted carrot

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the spinach is wilted


### Step 7

Once everything is nearly ready, boil a kettle

Combine your gravy base with 125ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water in the reserved bowl, whisk thoroughly

Put it in the microwave and cook for 30-40 secs or until thickened and give everything a good mix up – this is your gravy

### Step 8

Slice the rested pork belly

Serve the pork belly slices with the sausage stuffing, roast potatoes, spinach & carrots to the side

Drizzle the gravy over everything

Enjoy!
