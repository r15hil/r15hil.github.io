- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 x 125g mozzarella ball
- 2 ciabatta rolls 
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tbsp rich tomato paste
- 1 tin of chopped tomatoes

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Combine the beef mince, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of both salt and pepper in a bowl and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)


Divide the beef mince into 14 <span class="text-danger">[28]</span> and shape them into meatballs&nbsp;


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, or until they're browned all over


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;


Once the meatballs are browned, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Add the grated carrot and chopped onion&nbsp;to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened&nbsp;


Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the chopped garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 min further


Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomatoes, Italian seasoning,&nbsp;a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of both salt and pepper to the pan


Add half of the balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest in your salad dressing)&nbsp;


Add 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and return the meatballs to the pan&nbsp;


Cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly&nbsp;


### Step 6

Meanwhile, rip the ciabatta&nbsp;up into rough, bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Drain, pat dry and rip the&nbsp;mozzarella&nbsp;ball<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small, bite-sized pieces


Once thickened, transfer the meatballs and sauce to a baking dish (or individual baking dishes)&nbsp;


Top with the ripped mozzarella, ciabatta,&nbsp;a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of both salt and pepper&nbsp;


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until bubbling and golden


Meanwhile, chop the basil finely, including the stalks


Grind the chopped&nbsp;basil and a pinch of salt in a pestle &amp; mortar to form a smooth paste


Add 2-4 tbsp olive oil and mix well &ndash; this is your basil oil


Rip the red gem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rough pieces and add them to a large bowl

### Step 8

Once golden, remove the&nbsp;meatball melt from the oven and leave it to sit for 5 min &ndash; it will be very hot!


Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then dress the red gem&nbsp;lettuce&nbsp;


Serve the meatball melt&nbsp;drizzled with the basil oil with the salad to the side and enjoy!&nbsp;
