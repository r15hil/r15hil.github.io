## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 0 garam masala
- 16g tomato paste
- 1 red chilli
- 1 tomato
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 0 ground turmeric
- 6 plain tortillas
- 200g paneer
- 1 carrot
- 5g coriander
- 1 green pepper
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 2

Add the chopped coriander, garlic and ginger to a pestle & mortar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and grind to a paste

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of half your lemon[s], a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and mix to combine

Stir through the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy coriander chutney


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until softened


### Step 5

While the vegetables are softening, dice your tomato[es] finely

Top, tail, peel, then grate your carrots[s]


### Step 6

Once the vegetables have softened, add your garam masala, ground turmeric and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water with the juice of the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and begins to coat the vegetables

Once done, remove the pan from the heat – these are your curried vegetables


### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut your paneer into 6 equal strips per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the paneer strips with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min, turning once halfway, until golden

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs, or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill the warmed tortillas with the curried vegetables, grated carrot, golden paneer and diced tomato – these are your golden paneer Kati rolls

Drizzle over the spicy coriander chutney

Enjoy!
