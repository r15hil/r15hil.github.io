## Ingredients

- British lamb mince (250g)
- Feta (30g)
- Ground turmeric (0.5tsp)
- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- Harissa paste (20g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Tomato
- Shallot
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Roughly chop your tomato[es]


### Step 3

Add your lamb mince and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a large bowl with half the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and roll into 3 meatballs per person


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 6

Once browned, add the chopped shallot, chopped tomato and remaining chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

Once soft, add the tomato stock and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your harissa lamb meatballs


### Step 7

Return the pot with the drained potatoes to a low heat and add your ground turmeric, a large knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your turmeric mash

### Step 8

Serve the harissa lamb meatballs on top of the turmeric mash

Crumble your feta all over and garnish with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
