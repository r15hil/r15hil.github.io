## Ingredients

- 1 tahini sachet (15g)
- 1 can of chickpeas (400g)
- 100g Greek Feta Cheese Cypressa
- 1 pomegranate molasses pot (15g)
- 50g wild rocket
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Drain and rinse the chickpeas and add them to a food processor


### Step 2

Add the chopped&nbsp;garlic,&nbsp;tahini, 50ml&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span>&nbsp;olive oil,&nbsp;a splash of&nbsp;water&nbsp;and a very generous pinch of salt&nbsp;to the&nbsp;chickpeas


Blitz until smooth and creamy then set aside &ndash; this is your&nbsp;hummus&nbsp;


Tip: alternatively if you don't have a food processor, add all of the ingredients to a pot (or a flat based dish) and mash everything until you're left with a coarse hummus&nbsp;


### Step 3

Deseed the red &amp; yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)


### Step 4

Heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;sliced peppers and cook for 3-5 min until starting to blacken slightly and char (this adds a smoky flavour)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the pomegranate molasses with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt in a large bowl


Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well &ndash; this is your pomegranate dressing


### Step 6

Add the tortilla wraps to a baking tray


Put them in the oven for 2 min or until they're warmed through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the wild&nbsp;rocket to the pomegranate dressing and give it a good mix up &ndash; this is your pomegranate salad

### Step 8

Assemble your tortillas with the hummus, charred peppers&nbsp;and&nbsp;pomegranate salad,&nbsp;then crumble the feta all over


Enjoy!
