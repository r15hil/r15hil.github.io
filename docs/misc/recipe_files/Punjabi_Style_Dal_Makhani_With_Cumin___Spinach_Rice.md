### Step 1

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half your cumin seeds (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add the diced shallot, your ground turmeric and a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es]

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 3

Add your basmati rice, a pinch of salt, the remaining cumin seeds and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Once the shallot has softened, add the chopped tomato and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 3-4 min further or until the tomato is beginning to soften

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1701166871161-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add your tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

Add the drained cannellini beans and your green lentils and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften, then mash them roughly

Tip: Add a splash of water if it is looking a little dry – this will help to thicken the sauce!

### Step 6

Add the vegetable stock and your garam masala to the pan and bring to the boil

Cook for 6-8 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add your clotted cream and cook for 1 min or until melted – this is your Punjabi-style black dal makhani

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

Once the rice is done, stir through the chopped spinach and season with a pinch of salt – this is your cumin & spinach rice

### Step 8

Serve the Punjabi-style black dal makhani with the cumin & spinach rice

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
