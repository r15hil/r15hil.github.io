### Step 2

Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped pepper to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the pepper is beginning to char – this is your roasted pepper & mushrooms
