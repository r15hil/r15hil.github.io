Heat a medium-sized pot (with matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the onions and sultanas with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until the onion is softened


### Step 2

Stir in the basmati rice &amp; saffron, then add 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;water &amp; bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low &amp; cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed &amp; the rice is cooked


Remove from the heat &amp; keep covered until serving


Drain &amp; rinse the chickpeas


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Heat a large pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the chickpeas, half the garlic (reserve the rest for later!), cumin and curry powder with a pinch of salt&nbsp;


Cook for 5 min or until they're well coated and fragrant, then remove from the heat

Mix well and set aside for serving


### Step 5

Slice the remaining onion finely and add it to a bowl with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;flour


Toss the onion in the flour so it is coated evenly


Transfer the floured onion to a sieve and tap off the excess flour

While the oil heats, grab some kitchen towel and a slotted spoon&nbsp;


Once the oil is very hot, carefully add half the floured onions


Cook for 1 min or until darkened slightly in colour
