### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your basmati rice and chopped creamed coconut to a pot with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat – this is your coconut rice

### Step 3

Whilst the coconut rice is cooking, boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a generous pinch of salt and cook for an 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop your red chilli[es]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

### Step 5

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, chop the roots from your pak choi and separate the leaves, discarding the roots and tear any larger leaves in half

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves with a pinch of salt, cover with a lid and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

### Step 6

Once the pak choi is tender, add the chopped garlic, chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and coriander to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Add your fish sauce, lime leaves, the juice of half your lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and stir it all together – this is your fragrant stock

### Step 7

Add the fragrant stock to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your Thai-style broth

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the chicken and pak choi next to the coconut rice and ladle over the Thai-style broth

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions, reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
