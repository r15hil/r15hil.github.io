## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and onion wedges and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until beginning to char


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli tips away from the stalks and slice in half, then chop the broccoli stalks into quarters lengthways


### Step 4

Combine your soy sauce and cornflour in a small bowl

Add your ginger paste and Chinese rice wine to the bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, your hoisin sauce and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your stir fry sauce


### Step 5

Once the onion and mushrooms are beginning to char, press the Fable pulled mushrooms with the back of a spoon to flatten them

Add your toasted sesame oil to the pan with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced garlic, broccoli tips and stalks

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the stir fry sauce and your toasted sesame seeds

Cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Chinese-Style Fable mushroom & broccoli stir fry


### Step 7

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-Style Fable mushroom & broccoli stir-fry over the cooked rice

Enjoy!
