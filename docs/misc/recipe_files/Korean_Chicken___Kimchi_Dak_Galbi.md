## Ingredients

- 150g sushi rice
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 0 sushi rice
- 100g kimchi
- 15ml soy sauce
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 30g gochujang paste
- 25g honey
- 150g spring greens
- 3 garlic cloves
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other and chop roughly


### Step 4

Add the sliced onion, garlic and spring greens to a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid

Tip: Keep this off the heat as you'll just be using it to mix for now!

Top with the diced chicken thigh, soy sauce, gochujang, honey and kimchi

Season with a pinch of salt, drizzle with some vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Transfer the pan to the hob over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until the chicken and vegetables are starting to brown


### Step 6

Once starting to brown, reduce the heat to medium, add the lid to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the vegetables have softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & kimchi dak galbi


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken & kimchi dak galbi to a bowl and cover with tin foil

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooked rice to the pan and spread out with the back of a spoon

Cook for 2-3 min or until starting to crisp – this is your crispy rice

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & kimchi dak galbi with the crispy rice to the side

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
