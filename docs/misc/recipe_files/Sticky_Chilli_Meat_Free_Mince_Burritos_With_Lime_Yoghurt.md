### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the honey and cook for 2-3 min or until the mince becomes crispy and sticky – this is your sticky chilli meat-free mince
