### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish, all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Once fragrant, add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), balsamic vinegar and farfalle to the pot with your vegetable stock mix and 500ml<span class="text-purple"> [650ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [850ml] </span>boiled water and stir it all together

Tip: Nestle the farfalle into the stock as much as you can for even cooking!

Top the farfalle with your Greek cheese, bring to the boil over a high heat then cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

### Step 7

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cooked chicken breast

After an initial 15 min, add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Return to the oven, covered, and cook for a final 15-20 min or until the broccoli and pasta are tender – this is your oven baked Greek cheese, tomato & Tenderstem farfalle

### Step 8

Season the baked Greek cheese, tomato & farfalle with a generous pinch of pepper

Serve the cooked chicken breast to the side

Dig in!
