## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add half your smoked paprika and half your ground cumin (you'll use the rest later!) to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together

Add the chicken thighs to the spice blend and turn them several times until they're fully coated in all the spices – this is your spiced chicken


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer the chicken to a clean plate, reserving the pan


### Step 3

While the chicken is browning, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


### Step 4

Once hot, add most of the sliced red onion (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with your ground coriander, dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining cumin and smoked paprika

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[550ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water with your soy sauce – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 6

Add the sliced red pepper, drained black beans, basmati rice and tomato stock to the pan and stir everything together

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low

Cook your basmati rice for an initial 10 min then add the browned chicken (with any juices) and cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Mexican-style chicken & black bean pilaf


### Step 7

While the pilaf is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style chicken & black bean pilaf and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Garnish with the remaining sliced red onion and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
