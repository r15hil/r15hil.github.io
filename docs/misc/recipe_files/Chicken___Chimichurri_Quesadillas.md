Quesadillas are Mexico's delicious answer to cheese toasties. You'll fill tortillas with smoky shredded chicken and cheese, and serve with a zingy chimichurri dipping sauce made from chilli, coriander and vinegar.

## Ingredients

- 2 x 125g British chicken breast fillets
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 20g coriander
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 125g mozzarella ball
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Add the chicken breast fillets to a bowl with the smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and mix until coated


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based dry pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a high heat

Add the coated chicken and cook for 2 min on each side, then add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the sweet potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp


### Step 4

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped coriander, garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), red wine vinegar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a bowl

Season generously with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your chimichurri sauce


### Step 5

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Drain and pat the mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Add the torn mozzarella to the pan and mix it with the shredded chicken

Divide the chicken & mozzarella mixture between the tortilla wraps, covering only half

Fold each tortilla over and press down firmly so you're left with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> half moon-shaped sandwiches – these are your chicken quesadillas


### Step 7

Add the chicken quesadillas to a baking tray (or two!)

Place a second baking tray (or the tray of sweet potato wedges!) on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven for 10-12 min or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted

### Step 8

Serve the chicken quesadillas with the sweet potato wedges and chimichurri sauce to the side

Enjoy!
