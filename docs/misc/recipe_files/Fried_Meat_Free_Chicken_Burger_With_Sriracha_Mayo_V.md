### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, add the meat-free chicken bites to a bowl with the soy sauce and combine

Add the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mix well until evenly coated

Add the cornflour to the bowl and give everything a good stir until the meat-free chicken is fully coated in the cornflour mixture – this is your coated meat-free chicken

### Step 3

Combine the sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a separate bowl with the mayo – this is your sriracha mayo

Cut the remaining gem lettuce in half

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chicken and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your fried meat-free chicken

Tip: Add more oil to the pan if it is looking a little dry

### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice the brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill your warmed brioche halves with the outer lettuce leaves, sliced tomato, fried meat-free chicken and sriracha mayo

Serve the chips and lettuce halves to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with the dressing and serve any remaining sriracha mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
