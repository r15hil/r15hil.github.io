### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and a large pinch of sugar in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, curry powder and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

### Step 4

Once fragrant, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the rinsed lentils to the pan with the coconut stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are almost cooked and the sauce has thickened

### Step 5

While the lentils are cooking, dice your chicken breast strips into small bite-sized pieces

Add the diced chicken to a bowl with your ground paprika, nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your baby plum tomatoes in half

### Step 6

Add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for 5-7 min further or until the tomatoes have softened and the lentils are tender

Stir most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) through the lentils – this is your tomato & coconut dal

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1196.step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 7-8 min

Add your cider vinegar and cook for 3-4 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your paprika chicken

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the paprika chicken over the tomato & coconut dal with a warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
