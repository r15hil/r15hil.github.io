## Description

Our Nashville-style hot chicken is a little healthier, and gets a hefty hit of heat from our fiery hot sauce. Once your crispy, spicy chicken is baked, you'll serve it with ciabatta, dairy-free red cabbage slaw and tangy pickled cucumber.

## Ingredients

- 8ml sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 80g coconut yoghurt
- 1 ciabatta
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 10.5g wholegrain mustard
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cucumber
- 25g ground almonds
- 5g dill
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Add the ground almonds, half the ground paprika and half the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your Nashville-style chicken coating

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk alternative to a bowl


### Step 2

Add the chicken breast portions to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken


### Step 3

Dip the butterflied chicken in the milk alternative, then coat with the Nashville-style chicken coating until both sides are well coated

Add the coated chicken to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Nashville-style hot chicken


### Step 4

While the chicken is in the oven, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Combine the shredded red cabbage, sliced spring onion (save a little for garnish), half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> of the wholegrain mustard, half the cider vinegar and 2/3 coconut yoghurt in a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper – this is your slaw

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining wholegrain mustard for another recipe!


### Step 5

Cut the cucumber into batons

Chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Add the cucumber batons, chopped dill and remaining cider vinegar to a bowl, then season with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your pickled cucumber


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Once hot, add the sliced ciabatta, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving


### Step 7

Combine the sriracha, remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining ground paprika with the remaining coconut yoghurt

Pour in half of the liquid from the pickled cucumber and give everything a good mix up – this is your hot sauce

### Step 8

Serve the Nashville-style hot chicken over the toasted ciabatta slice with pickled cucumber and slaw to the side

Drizzle the hot sauce over the chicken

Sprinkle over the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
