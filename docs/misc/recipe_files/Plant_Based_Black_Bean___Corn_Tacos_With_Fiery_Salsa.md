Dice the remaining onion finely

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

While the onion is softening, drain and rinse your black beans and sweetcorn

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onion has started to soften, increase the heat to medium-high and add the drained black beans & sweetcorn to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until the corn is charred

### Step 4

While the veg is cooking, dice your tomato[es] finely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Combine the diced red onion, diced tomato, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and chopped coriander in a bowl

Add the juice of half your lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar, then stir it all together – this is your fiery salsa

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 6

Once the corn is charred, add your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the vegetable stock and cook for 2-3 min or until it's reduced

Once done, crush some of the beans with a masher and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your plant-based black bean & corn

Spread your smashed avocado over the warmed tortillas

Top with the plant-based black bean & corn and fiery salsa

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
