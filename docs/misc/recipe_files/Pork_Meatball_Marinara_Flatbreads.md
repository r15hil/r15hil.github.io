### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape them into 6 meatballs per person

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix and a pinch of sugar in 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water

Add your oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and your chopped tomatoes and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinara sauce

### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 4

Add your naan[s] to a baking tray

Spread 1/3 of the marinara sauce over each naan in a thin layer and top with the meatballs and torn mozzarella

Put the loaded naans in the oven for 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the mozzarella is melted and golden – these are your meatball marinara flatbreads

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Add the remaining marinara sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your marinara dip

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

While the marinara is cooking, wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Enjoy!
