## Ingredients

- British slow cooked duck leg x0
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Dried thyme (0.5tsp)
- Red wine paste (10g)
- Shredded red cabbage (150g)
- British slow cooked duck legs (2pcs)
- White potato x3
- Red wine vinegar (30ml)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml) x0
- British free range egg
- Garlic clove
- Sultanas (30g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife

Combine your egg[s] with 35g<span class="text-purple"> [50g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[70g]</span> flour and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk in a jug, then whisk in your dried thyme and a pinch of salt – this is your batter

Put the batter in the fridge to rest


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Heat a separate pot over a low heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add your shredded red cabbage, sultanas and red wine vinegar to the pot and season with a generous pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 30 min, stirring occasionally – this is your red cabbage


### Step 4

Separate your duck leg[s] from the white duck fat and duck jelly (you'll use these in different parts of the recipe!)

Add the duck leg[s] to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the drained potatoes to the other side of the tray[s] with half the white duck fat (you'll use the rest later!) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until everything is golden and crispy


### Step 5

Divide the remaining white duck fat between 2 holes per person of a muffin tray and put it in the oven for 8 min to heat up

Tip: No muffin tray? Fill a small oven-proof dish with the duck fat to make one giant Yorkshire!

After 8 min, carefully remove the muffin tray from the oven and evenly drizzle the rested batter into the hot fat, then return the tray to the oven for 20 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your herby Yorkshires


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add your beef stock mix and red wine stock paste to the pan with the reserved duck jelly, crushed garlic and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your garlic-infused gravy


### Step 7

Reboil half a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the halved green beans to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and season with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

### Step 8

Serve the roasted duck leg with the duck fat roasties, herby Yorkshires, red cabbage and cooked green beans to the side

Discard the crushed garlic from the garlic-infused gravy and drizzle all over

Enjoy!
