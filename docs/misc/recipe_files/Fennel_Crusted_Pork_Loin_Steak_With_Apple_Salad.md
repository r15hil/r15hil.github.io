### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> pepper (freshly ground is best!) and a generous pinch of salt

Grind to a coarse powder, add a drizzle of olive oil and mix to combine – this is your fennel paste


### Step 3

Add your pork loin steak[s] to a baking tray and spread the fennel paste evenly over the top

Add the onion wedges to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through


### Step 4

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and rinse under cold water until cool


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your wholegrain mustard, cider vinegar and onion marmalade with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mustard & onion dressing


### Step 6

Finely slice your apple[s], discarding the core[s]


### Step 7

Once the steak is done, remove them from the oven and set aside to rest – this are your fennel-crusted pork loin steak

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the sliced apple, salad, cooled bulgur and red onion wedges to the bowl of dressing and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your apple salad

### Step 8

Slice the fennel-crusted pork loin steak as finely as you can

Serve the sliced fennel-crusted pork loin steak over the apple salad

Drizzle over any resting juices from the pork

Enjoy!
