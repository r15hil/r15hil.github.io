### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take a generous knob of butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min or until starting to brown

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and grate your garlic

Trim your green beans

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 3

Heat a pot with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!) with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pot with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened, then set aside until serving – this is your tomato sauce

Whilst the sauce is cooking, combine your softened butter in a bowl with the remaining grated garlic and your fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) – this is your fennel butter

### Step 5

Add the trimmed green beans and chopped tomato to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a splash of water, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then scrunch the foil around the veg to form a tightly sealed parcel[s]

Once the potatoes have had an initial 12 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the parcel[s] to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10-12 min or until the potatoes are crisp and the veg is tender – these are your roast potatoes & steamed veg

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add a handful of flour to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the basa fillet[s] to the plate and turn several times until fully coated – this is your coated basa

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1710843588726-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa with a pinch of salt and cook for 6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried basa over the tomato sauce with the roast potatoes and steamed veg to the side

Top the basa with the fennel butter

Enjoy!
