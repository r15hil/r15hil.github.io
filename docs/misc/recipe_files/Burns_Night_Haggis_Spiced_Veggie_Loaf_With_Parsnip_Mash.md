## Ingredients

- 1 can of green lentils (185g)
- 1 parsnip
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 20g onion marmalade
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 2 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 2.5g cracked black pepper
- 1 pot of wholegrain mustard (21g)
- 1 Marmite pot (8g)
- 0 chestnut mushrooms
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 cavolo nero
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then top, tail and dice your carrot[s] finely and finely chop your chestnut mushrooms

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the diced carrot and cook for 2-3 min, then add the chopped mushrooms and cook for a further 5-7 min


### Step 2

While the mushrooms are cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and chop your parsnip[s] and potato[es] into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped vegetables to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and leave them to steam dry, reserving the pot for later


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Add the chopped garlic to the pan with the drained lentils, your cracked black pepper and your ground allspice (not a fan of allspice? Don't add it all!), give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

While the mixture is cooking, dissolve your Marmite and half your vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock

Add the stock to the pan with your panko breadcrumbs, mix everything together and cook for 1-2 min or until the stock has been completely absorbed – this is your haggis spiced veggie loaf mix

Reboil a kettle


### Step 5

Line a loaf tin (approx. 23x13x7cm) with non-stick baking paper and grease with vegetable oil

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 tins!

Add the haggis-spiced veggie loaf mix to the prepared tin[s], pressing down into the corners and smoothing out the top, then reserve the pan and wipe clean with kitchen paper

Put in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until crisp on the top


### Step 6

Wash, then chop your cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Add the chopped cavolo nero to a large piece of tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil

When the haggis loaf is almost cooked, scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray, then put in the oven for 8-10 min or until the greens are wilted

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter, once melted add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, until a sandy paste forms

Whisk in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, your onion marmalade and the remaining vegetable stock mix and cook for 4-5 min or until the gravy has thickened – this is your onion gravy

Return the drained vegetables to the reserved pot over a low heat with a splash of milk and a knob of butter and mash until smooth – this is your parsnip mash

### Step 8

Gently turn the haggis-spiced veggie loaf out onto a chopping board, let it cool slightly and slice thickly (it's meant to be crumbly!)

Serve the haggis-spiced veggie loaf with the parsnip mash and cavolo nero to the side

Drizzle over the onion gravy, dollop your wholegrain mustard to the side and season to taste

Enjoy!
