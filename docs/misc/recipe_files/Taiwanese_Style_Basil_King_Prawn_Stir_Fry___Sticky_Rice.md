## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a small pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Whilst the sushi rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your pak choi, and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop the roots from the pak choi, slice the white base finely and roughly tear the pak choi leaves in half

Chop your basil stalks finely, keeping the leaves and chopped stalks separate


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Drain your king prawns

Once hot, add the king prawns and cook for an initial 1-2 min


### Step 5

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and basil stalks to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and Chinese rice wine with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Add the chopped pak choi bases and cook for 1 min further


### Step 7

Add the torn pak choi leaves and basil leaves and cook for 1-2 min further or until everything's wilted and evenly coated in the sauce and the prawns are cooked through â€“ this is your Taiwanese-style basil king prawn stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the Taiwanese-style basil king prawn stir-fry with the sticky rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
