### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the chopped pepper to the pan[s]

Cook for a further 6-7 min or until the pepper is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 3

While the chicken and pepper is cooking, add your rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked with a slight bite, drain the noodles and set aside

Give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your pad Thai sauce

### Step 5

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] into thirds

Finely chop your roasted peanuts

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked through, reduce the heat to medium

Push the chicken and pepper to one side of the pan[s] and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min or until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the chicken and pepper

### Step 7

Add the pad Thai sauce to the pan[s] with the chopped garlic and chopped spring onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked noodles

Cook for a final 1 min and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken pad Thai

### Step 8

Serve the chicken pad Thai and top with the chopped peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
