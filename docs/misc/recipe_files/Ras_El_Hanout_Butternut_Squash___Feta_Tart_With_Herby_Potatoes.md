## Ingredients

- Lemon
- Butternut squash cubes (160g)
- Ras el hanout (1tbsp)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Red chilli relish (40g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Flaked almonds (15g)
- Feta (30g)
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into thin wedges

Add your butternut squash cubes and onion wedges to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with your ras el hanout, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the butternut squash is starting to soften


### Step 2

While the veg is cooking, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife (the border will puff up and form a nice crust)


### Step 3

Spread your red chilli relish over the pastry, keeping it within the borders

Top with the cooked butternut squash & red onion and a small drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the pastry is golden and crisp and the edges have puffed up


### Step 4

While the tart[s] is cooking, chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Chop the mint leaves and coriander together, including the stalks

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) then cut into wedges

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the tart[s] is lightly golden, remove from the oven and top with your flaked almonds

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3-4 min or until the almonds are toasted and lightly golden

Once golden, remove the tart[s] from the oven and crumble over your feta and lemon zest, then season with a grind of black pepper – this is your ras el hanout butternut squash & feta tart[s]


### Step 7

Once done, add a knob of butter to the potatoes with the chopped herbs and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a gentle mix up – these are your herby potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the ras el hanout butternut squash & feta tart[s] with the herby potatoes to the side

Serve the salad to the side and season with a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper

Garnish with a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!
