## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 2

Peel your garlic then add it to a food processor with your basil, 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> olive oil, your white wine vinegar, half your walnuts (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt

Blitz until smooth – this is your walnut pesto dressing

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop everything very finely and mix!


### Step 3

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 8 min


### Step 4

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Cut your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 5

Once the chicken has had 8 min, add the halved green beans to the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 7 min further

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

Once the green beans have had 7 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the remaining walnuts

Return the tray to the oven for a final 3 min or until the walnuts are toasted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the roasted green beans, halved cherry tomatoes, spinach, toasted walnuts, green lentils and most of the walnut pesto dressing (save some for garnish!) in a large bowl – this is your lentil & walnut pesto salad

Slice the cooked chicken finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken with the lentil & walnut pesto salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining walnut pesto dressing over the sliced chicken

Enjoy!
