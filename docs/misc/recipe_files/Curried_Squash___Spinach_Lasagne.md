### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 3

Once softened, add your cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and butternut squash cubes and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant add the vegetable stock and spinach and cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until the butternut squash is tender – this is your spiced spinach & butternut squash mix

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 4

Melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat, then add your curry powder and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk gradually and whisk for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then remove from the heat, stir through half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your curried béchamel

### Step 5

Layer some of the spiced spinach & butternut squash mix over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets (you may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish)

### Step 6

Top the lasagne sheets with the curried béchamel

Sprinkle over your nigella seeds and the remaining grated cheese and put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the pasta is cooked through and everything's golden – this is your curried squash & spinach lasagne

### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your white wine vinegar to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and stir it all together – this is your salad dressing

Once the lasagne is almost cooked, add the baby leaf salad to the salad dressing and give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the curried squash & spinach lasagne with the salad to the side

Enjoy!
