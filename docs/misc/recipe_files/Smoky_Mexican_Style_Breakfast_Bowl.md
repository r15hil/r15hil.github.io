## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes to the pan along with your roasted garlic paste and ground smoked paprika and cook for 1-2 min until the tomatoes have started to break down


### Step 4

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the vegetable stock, chopped tomatoes and drained black beans to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until thickened and gently bubbling – these are your smoky beans


### Step 6

Make 1 well per person in the smoky beans and crack your egg[s] into the well

Cover with a lid and cook for 4-6 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your smoky beans & egg

Add your wholemeal pitta to the toaster for 1-2 min until warmed through, then slice into triangles – these are your pitta chips


### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways

Roughly chop your chives

### Step 8

Serve the smoky beans & egg in a bowl with the sliced avocado and pitta chips to the side – this is your smoky Mexican-style breakfast bowl

Sprinkle over the chopped chives and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
