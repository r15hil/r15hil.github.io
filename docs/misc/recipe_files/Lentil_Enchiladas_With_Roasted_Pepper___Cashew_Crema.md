## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large strips


### Step 2

Add the pepper strips and garlic (skin on) to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pepper has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add most of the diced onion (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your ground smoked paprika and ground cumin to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Add the drained lentils, soy sauce, tomato paste and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has reduced to a thick, ragù-like consistency – this is your lentil mixture


### Step 5

Once thickened, divide most of the lentil mixture between your plain tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and arrange them in an oven-proof dish (or two!), then top with the remaining lentil mixture and drizzle over some olive oil

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 8-10 min or until the tortillas are starting to crisp – these are your lentil enchiladas


### Step 6

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!), then peel and discard the skin from the roasted garlic

Add the chopped coriander, peeled roasted garlic, roasted pepper, cashew nuts, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half your lime juice, 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt to a food processor and blitz until smooth – this is your roasted pepper & cashew crema

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can!


### Step 7

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half and season them with a pinch of salt

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the lentil enchiladas and top with the roasted pepper & cashew crema and the halved cherry tomatoes

Garnish with the remaining diced onion, reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
