### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool slightly

### Step 2

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 3

Slice the drained tofu lengthways into 2 flat pieces per person, then score in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way

Combine your Chinese rice wine and half your soy sauce in a large bowl with your hoisin sauce and juice of half your lime – this is your lighter hoisin marinade

Dip the tofu slices into the marinade, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!)

### Step 4

Spoon the remaining lighter hoisin marinade over the tofu slices, reserving the bowl

Tip: Make sure to get all the marinade onto the tofu, not the tray[s]!

Drizzle a little vegetable oil on the tofu and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the tofu is slightly crisp – this is your lighter hoisin tofu

### Step 5

Add the remaining lime juice to the reserved bowl with your vegan mayo, plum chutney and remaining soy sauce

Give it a good mix up until fully combined – this is your plum dressing
