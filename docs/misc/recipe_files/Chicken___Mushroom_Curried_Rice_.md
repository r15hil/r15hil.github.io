## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 4 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced onion and sliced mushrooms to the pan with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is starting to soften


### Step 5

Once softened, add your ginger & garlic paste and curry powder to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your sultanas and chicken stock mix to the pan with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water

Cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & mushroom curry


### Step 7

Once done, add the cooked rice to the chicken & mushroom curry with a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your chicken & mushroom curried rice

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & mushroom curried rice

Enjoy!
