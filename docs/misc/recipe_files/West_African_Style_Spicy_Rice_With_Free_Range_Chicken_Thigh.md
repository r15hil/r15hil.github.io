### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the free range chicken thighs to a bowl with your ground smoked paprika and dried oregano

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your smoky chicken thighs

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)  with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the smoky chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly charred

Transfer the charred chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), reserve the pan

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until starting to soften

Whilst the onion is softening, slice half of your green chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Finely chop the remaining green chilli[es]

### Step 5

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onion has slightly softened, add the chopped garlic and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your ground turmeric and curry powder to the pan and cook for 1 min until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the diced carrot and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Add the diced pepper, white long grain rice and bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the pan with the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1690876720142-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, gently stir in your blanched peas and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through – this is your West African-style spicy rice

### Step 8

Serve the smoky free range chicken thighs over the West African-style spicy rice, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Garnish with the chilli rounds

Drizzle any remaining juices from the chicken over the rice

Enjoy!
