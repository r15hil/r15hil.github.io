Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and grate your garlic

Once the potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and top the vegetables with the pork loin steak[s]

Sprinkle over the garlic breadcrumbs then return the dish to the oven and cook for a further 20-25 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the breadcrumbs are golden

Combine half the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) with your soft cheese, Dijon mustard, chicken stock mix and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[125ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chive & mustard sauce

Serve the garlic crusted pork loin steak with the roasted vegetables to the side

Drizzle over the chives & mustard sauce and garnish with the remaining chopped chives
