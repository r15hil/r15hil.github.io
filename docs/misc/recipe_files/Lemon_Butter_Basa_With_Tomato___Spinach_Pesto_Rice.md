- Traditional Italian pesto (45g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice quarter of your lemon[s] into rounds

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your basa fillet[s] and top with the lemon rounds and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the fish is starting to brown

Combine the chopped garlic and the juice of the remaining lemon[s] in a bowl with a large knob of butter

Season with salt and pepper – this is your lemon butter


### Step 4

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 5

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the rice is piping hot, add it to a bowl with your traditional Italian pesto, chopped tomatoes and the spinach

Season with salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your tomato & spinach pesto rice


### Step 7

Once the basa is starting to brown, add the lemon butter and cook for a further 2 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your lemon butter basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the lemon butter basa with the tomato & spinach pesto rice to the side

Spoon over any excess lemon butter

Enjoy!
