## Instructions


### Step 1

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layer[s] and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Chop your waxy potatoes in half


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice, outer lemongrass layers and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and discard the outer lemongrass layers, keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cardamom pods, chopped lemongrass core, your ground cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Only add a little!), ginger & garlic paste and red Thai curry paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, add the halved waxy potatoes and cook for 2 min further or until the potatoes are coated in spices


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, your vegetable stock mix and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 325ml<span class="text-purple"> [420ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock and your tamarind paste to the pan and cook, covered, for 13-15 min or until the potatoes are almost fork-tender


### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, discard the cardamom pods from the curry

Add the sliced pepper and your mangetout and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the veg is cooked through – this is your massaman-style vegetable curry

### Step 8

Serve the massaman-style vegetable curry over the lemongrass rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out!

Garnish with the crushed roasted peanuts

Enjoy!
