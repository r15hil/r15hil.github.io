## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a large oven-proof dish (or two!)

Add the chopped aubergine to one side of the dish[es] with the onion wedges and cherry tomatoes

Sprinkle over your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), with your dried oregano and half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up


### Step 4

Top the mixed vegetables with your Greek cheese, then drizzle half of your honey (save the rest for later!) over the top

Add your gnocchi to the other side of the dish[es] with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 5

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the Greek cheese is slightly charred and the gnocchi is golden and crispy

Combine the remaining red wine vinegar with the remaining honey and a generous drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl – this is your honey vinaigrette


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Boil half a kettle

Once the Greek cheese is slightly charred and the gnocchi is golden, remove the dish[es] from the oven and add a small splash of boiled water

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined and saucy – this is your honey baked Greek cheese & crispy gnocchi

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred


### Step 8

Serve the honey baked Greek cheese & crispy gnocchi

Drizzle the honey vinaigrette over the shredded lettuce and toss it all together

Dig in!
