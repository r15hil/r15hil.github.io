## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, your ground smoked paprika and ground cumin to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Drain and rinse your black beans

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and chipotle stock and cook, covered for 5-7 min or until the beans are soft enough to mash


### Step 5

While the black beans are cooking, chop your coriander including the stalks

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Once the beans have softened, remove from the heat and add a generous knob of butter, then mash them until smooth – these are your Brazilian-style black beans


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

On a clean chopping board, chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add the chopped basa to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the basa is cooked, add it to a bowl with your mango chutney, the sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Zest and juice half your lime[s] into the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty lime basa

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style black beans over the cooked brown rice and top with the zesty lime basa

Garnish with the coriander and lime wedge

Enjoy!
