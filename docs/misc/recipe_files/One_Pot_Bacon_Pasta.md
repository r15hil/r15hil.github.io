## Description

The secret to this dish is cooking your linguine in the same pan as you've fried your bacon, before adding in a measured amount of stock. You then throw in your raw ingredients: garlic, cherry tomatoes, cheese and herbs, to cook as one; marrying together to form perfectly cooked pasta and a silky smooth sauce.

### Step 6

After 5 min, remove the lid, and stir continuously until the pasta is cooked and a sauce has formed (add more water if it looks too dry)


Tip: stirring the sauce releases the starch from the pasta making it naturally creamier
