### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes into small bite-sized pieces, then deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] and drain your sweetcorn

### Step 2

Combine your tomato ketchup, tomato paste, Henderson's Relish, most of your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar in a bowl

Add 140ml<span class="text-purple"> [180ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[220ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your BBQ sauce

### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 5

Once the chicken is golden, remove the pan from the heat and add the BBQ sauce

Return the pan to a medium-high heat, cover with a lid and cook for a further 10-12 min, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky BBQ chicken

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened (add a splash of water if the pot is looking a little dry!)

Once softened, add the drained sweetcorn to the pot and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the sweetcorn is warmed through – this is your pepper & corn salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1708528771167-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add a knob of butter to a bowl with the remaining ground smoked paprika

Add the bowl to the microwave for 20 secs or until the butter has completely melted – this is your smoky butter

### Step 8

Serve the smoky BBQ chicken with the pepper & corn salad and crispy potatoes to the side

Top the salad with the sliced spring onion and smoky butter

Enjoy!
