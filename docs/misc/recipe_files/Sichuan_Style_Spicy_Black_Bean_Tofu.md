### Step 1

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

While the rice is cooking, grate your chestnut mushrooms

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut half the tofu into bite-sized cubes (save the rest for later!)

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, crumble the remaining tofu finely into the pan

Add the grated mushroom and cook for 7-8 min, stirring occasionally, or until the mushrooms and tofu are browned and crispy

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 5

Once the mushrooms are browned and crispy, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the diced onion to the pan with a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and tofu cubes to the pan and give everything a good mix up, then cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your black bean paste and soy sauce in a bowl with your cornflour, toasted sesame oil, dried chilli flakes, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water to the bowl and mix until fully combined – this is your Sichuan-style spicy black bean sauce

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your spinach to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach is wilted

Once wilted, add the Sichuan-style spicy sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened and everything is well coated – this is your Sichuan-style spicy black bean tofu

### Step 8

Serve the Sichuan-style spicy black bean tofu over the cooked rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
