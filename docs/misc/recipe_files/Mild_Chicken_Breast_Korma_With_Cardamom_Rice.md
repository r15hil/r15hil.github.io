## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with a knife

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a large knob of butter over a medium heat and once melted, add the crushed cardamom pods and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 2

Once fragrant, add your basmati rice, sultanas and a pinch of salt and cook for a further 1 min, then add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your cardamom rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the diced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add your garam masala, ground turmeric, chopped garlic and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min further


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Increase the heat to high and add the chopped chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until browned all over


### Step 7

Once the chicken has browned, add the chicken stock and ground almonds to the pan and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, stir in your natural yoghurt and cook for a further 1 min or until it's warmed through – this is your mild chicken breast korma

### Step 8

Serve the mild chicken breast korma with the cardamom rice to the side

Tip: Watch out for the cardamom pods and discard them!

Enjoy!
