### Step 4

Once the prawns have started to turn pink, add the cooked Thai rice noodles, coconut stock and mangetout to the pan

Stir through the spinach and cook for 2 min until the spinach has wilted and the mangetout has started to soften – this is your Thai green prawn noodle soup

### Step 5

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Thai green prawn noodle soup in bowls and tear over the coriander leaves

Sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes and serve with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
