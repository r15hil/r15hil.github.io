### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and slice your shallot[s] into rings

Slice your cucumber finely into discs

Add the cucumber discs and cider vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – these are your 'pickles'

### Step 2

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, set aside until you're ready to build your pizza

### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add your panko breadcrumbs and ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate plate with a drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together

Season your chicken breast strips with a generous pinch of salt, coat them in flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded chicken dippers

### Step 4

Add the breaded chicken dippers to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for<span class="text-danger"> </span>18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken dippers

### Step 5

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic, a pinch of salt and pepper and 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato sauce evenly all over the pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with the browned mince and grated cheddar and place the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or or until the cheese has melted, the base is crisp and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your 'cheeseburger' pizza

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1707841989984-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the pizza is cooking, combine your mustard ketchup and tomato ketchup in a bowl with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your burger sauce

### Step 8

Serve the 'cheeseburger' pizza with the chicken dippers to the side

Top the pizza with half the 'pickles' and the shallot rings

Drizzle most of the burger sauce over the top and serve any remaining 'pickles' and burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!
