### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

Add your couscous, stir, cover and set aside

### Step 3

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] to the pan, skin-side down, with a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your ras el hanout over the fish and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your spiced salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it's opaque and flakes easily

### Step 4

While the salmon is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

Dice your tomato[es]

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the juice of half your lemon[s], a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and black pepper

Fluff the couscous with a fork

Add the diced tomatoes, sliced spring onion and ground sumac with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and black pepper – this is your tomato & sumac couscous

Serve the spiced salmon, tomato & sumac couscous and salad on a plate

Crumble your feta to serve on top and place a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
