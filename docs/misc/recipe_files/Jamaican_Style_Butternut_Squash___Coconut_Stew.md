### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and butternut squash cubes and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise

### Step 3

While the vegetables are cooking, boil a kettle

Dice your tomato[es]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and chopped creamed coconut in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Drain your pineapple and reserve the pineapple juice

### Step 5

Add your ground coriander, ground allspice and curry powder to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped garlic, diced tomato and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min further

Add the coconut stock and the pineapple juice (save the pineapple for later!) and cook for 15 min or until the butternut squash is fork-tender

### Step 6

While the butternut squash is cooking, chop the pineapple roughly

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped pineapple, the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and half of the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl – this is your pineapple salsa

### Step 7

Once the butternut squash is fork-tender and the sauce has thickened, stir through the remaining chopped coriander – this is your Jamaican-style butternut squash & coconut stew

### Step 8

Serve the Jamaican-style butternut squash & coconut stew with the brown rice to the side

Top with the pineapple salsa

Enjoy!
