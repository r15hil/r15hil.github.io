## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle, then heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add half of your beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) to a large heatproof bowl with your diced apricots and couscous

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and give it a stir, then cover and set aside – this is your fruity couscous


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 2 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add your baharat, roasted garlic paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for a further 2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste, chopped dates, 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [400ml]</span> boiled water and the remaining beef stock mix

Cook for 3-4 min or until the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a stew-like consistency


### Step 5

Once thickened, add the drained chickpeas and cook for 30 secs further or until the chickpeas are warmed through – this is your baharat beef stew

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 6

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them roughly and discard the stems

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks


### Step 7

Fluff up the fruity couscous with a fork and add a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the baharat beef stew alongside the fruity couscous

Garnish with the chopped mint and parsley 

Enjoy!
