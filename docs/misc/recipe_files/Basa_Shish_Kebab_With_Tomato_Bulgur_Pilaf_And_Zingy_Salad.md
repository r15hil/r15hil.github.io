### Step 1

Slice the basa fillets into thin strips, then add them to a bowl with the ground paprika, ground cumin and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up, then put in the fridge to marinate until later

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> as finely as you can

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion and cook for 6 min or until softened

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking!)

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the bulgur wheat and sultanas and cook for 1 min or until coated in the oil

Add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the water has absorbed and the bulgur is cooked – this is your tomato bulgur pilaf

### Step 5

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, preheat the grill to high

Thread the marinated basa strips evenly onto 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>soaked skewers, leaving a small gap between each piece – these are your basa shish kebabs

### Step 6

Add the basa shish kebabs to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray under the grill for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

While the fish is cooking, add the natural yoghurt to a bowl with a pinch of salt and a small squeeze of lemon juice (save the rest for later!) – this is your lemon yoghurt

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1624292071571-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the juice from the remaining lemon to a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt, then add the grated carrot, diced tomato and baby leaf salad

Give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salad

### Step 8

Drizzle the lemon yoghurt over the basa shish kebabs and serve with the tomato bulgur pilaf and the zingy salad to the side

Enjoy!
