## Instructions


### Step 1

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped onion and sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add 3/4 of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with your orzo and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil


### Step 4

Add your vegetable stock mix and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water to the pan with your orzo and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking


### Step 5

While the orzo is cooking, reboil a kettle

Wash your shredded kale and spinach, then add them to a pot with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted, once done, drain and rinse under cold running water until cool

Once cool, squeeze out as much water as you can – this is your cooked kale & spinach


### Step 6

Add the cooked kale & spinach to a food processor with your basil, flaked almonds, half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and the remaining chopped garlic

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your pesto

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Combine the salad and chopped tomato in a bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your dressed salad

Once the orzo is cooked through, add the pesto to the pan and cook for 1-2 min – this is your basil, almond & kale pesto orzo

### Step 8

Serve the basil, almond & kale pesto orzo with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese sprinkled over the top

Serve the dressed salad on top of the basil, almond & kale pesto orzo

Enjoy!
