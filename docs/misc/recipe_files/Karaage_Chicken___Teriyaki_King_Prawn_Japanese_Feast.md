### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then peel and finely slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and half your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Heat a pot with a matching lid with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced shallot, sliced garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy

Once crispy, carefully pour the oil into a heatproof bowl and set aside, reserving the pot – this is your crispy chilli oil

### Step 2

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water to the reserved pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

While the rice is cooking, add your diced chicken thigh to a large bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and set aside to marinate

Soak your skewer[s] in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

### Step 4

Preheat the grill to medium-high

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Peel and grate the remaining garlic

Combine the grated garlic & ginger, remaining soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your teriyaki sauce

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1678182460732-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Add your cornflour to the marinated chicken and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your karaage chicken

### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, drain your king prawns, then add them to the teriyaki sauce and mix all together until the prawns are fully coated

Thread the coated prawns onto the soaked skewer[s], then add to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray under the grill for 4-5 min, turning half way or until cooked through – this is your teriyaki prawn skewer

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1678182480459-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the rinsed edamame beans to a bowl with half of the sriracha mayo (you'll use the rest later!) and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your edamame salad

### Step 8

Serve the karaage chicken and the teriyaki prawn skewer with the sushi rice, edamame salad and remaining sriracha mayo to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Pour your crispy chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the sushi rice

Enjoy!
