## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 32g tomato paste
- 2g smoked sea salt flakes
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 450g slow cooked pork ribs
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 185g canned cannellini beans
- 1 green chilli
- 3 white potatoes
- 30ml tomato ketchup
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 25g honey

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Add the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Remove the seeds!) to a small bowl with half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a small pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Mix everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli


### Step 2

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden


### Step 3

Add the slow cooked pork ribs to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 4

While everything's in the oven, combine the tomato ketchup with all the<span class="text-danger"> </span>cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the honey, half the smoked paprika and half the tomato paste (save the rest for later!)

Add the remaining cider vinegar with the smoked sea salt flakes and give everything a good mix up – this is your Kansas-style sauce

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

After an initial 20 min, remove the ribs from the oven and pour over half of the Kansas-style sauce (save the rest for later!), spreading the sauce out evenly with the back of a spoon (or cooking brush!)

Return the ribs to the oven for a final 6-7 min until sticky – these are your Kansas-style ribs


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a little drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with the remaining smoked paprika and remaining tomato paste and cook for 1 min


### Step 7

Drain the quick-pickled chilli and reserve the pickling liquid

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water to the pot with the chicken stock mix, the pickling liquid from the green chillies and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – these are your spicy BBQ beans

### Step 8

Loosen the remaining Kansas-style sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Serve the Kansas-style ribs with the spicy BBQ beans, wedges and mayo to the side

Sprinkle the quick-pickled green chilli over the wedges and add the Kansas-style sauce to a little pot

Enjoy!
