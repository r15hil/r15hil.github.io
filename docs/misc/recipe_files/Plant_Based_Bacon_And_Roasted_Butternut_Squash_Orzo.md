### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Add half your butternut squash cubes (save the rest for later!) to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 4-5 min or until the squash is fork-tender

### Step 2

Add the remaining butternut squash cubes to a large baking tray (or two!) with half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

### Step 4

Once the microwaved squash is done, add it to a food processor with the remaining ground smoked paprika, vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water

Blitz until smooth – this is your smoky squash purée

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add your orzo and thyme leaves to the pan and cook for 2-3 min

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1689690033221-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the smoky squash purée to the orzo with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, stirring frequently, for 10-12 min or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite

Tip: Stirring the orzo will release the starch from the pasta, making it creamier! If your pan starts to look a little dry, just add a splash more water

Once the orzo is done, wash then add your spinach to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further, stirring until the spinach has wilted

### Step 7

Whist your orzo is cooking, add your meat-free bacon lardons to the tray[s] with the squash

Drizzle the lardons with vegetable oil and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min further or until the bacon is warmed through and the squash has started to colour

### Step 8

Serve the butternut squash orzo topped with the roasted butternut squash and the meat-free bacon lardons

Season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
