## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 30g breadcrumbs
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 1 British free-range egg
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 5g parsley
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Cut the waxy potatoes in half (skins on)


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until almost fork-tender


### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl with a splash of cold water and beat with a fork

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate


### Step 4

Coat the basa fillets in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them into the beaten egg

Finally press them into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded fish


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded fish and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your crispy breaded fish

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters

Combine the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), chopped parsley, clotted cream and the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon quarter<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your garlic butter


### Step 7

Trims the green beans

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add the green beans to the pot and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once done, drain and return them to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil, the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon quarter<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Top the crispy breaded fish with the garlic butter – this is your garlicky breaded fish

Serve the tender green beans and potatoes to the side, and garnish with a remaining lemon quarter

Enjoy!
