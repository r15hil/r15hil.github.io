- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Red chilli
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Curry powder (1tbsp)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)

- British diced chicken thigh (250g)
- Flaked almonds (15g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain, return to the pot and set aside for later


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh and your curry powder and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your cucumber finely

Wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the outer leaves into large bite-sized pieces and finely shred the inner core


### Step 4

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Pick your coriander leaves from their stalks and set aside for garnish

Chop the coriander stalks finely


### Step 5

Add your natural yoghurt to a large bowl with your mango chutney, chopped coriander stalks, sultanas and the juice of half your lime[s]

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your yoghurt mix

Once cooked through, add the chicken to the yoghurt mix and stir it all together – this is your creamy coronation chicken


### Step 6

Combine the juice of the remaining lime[s] with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime dressing


### Step 7

Add the drained potatoes to a bowl with all the outer lettuce leaves, shredded inner core and sliced cucumber

Add the lime dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

### Step 8

Divide the crunchy salad between bowls

Top with the creamy coronation chicken and garnish with the coriander leaves, flaked almonds and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
