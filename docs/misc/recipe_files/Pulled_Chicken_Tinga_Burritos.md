## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 1 gem lettuce
- 32g tomato paste
- 50ml mayonnaise 
- 15ml soy sauce
- 185g canned black beans
- 100g basmati rice
- 4 plain tortillas
- 320g British skinless chicken thighs
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thigh to the pan with the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), smoked paprika, ground cumin and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Combine the mayo with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo

Drain and rinse the black beans

Dissolve the tomato paste and soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the chicken is cooked, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for 10 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Once the chicken is almost done, add the tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 5

Once the rice is cooked, stir the drained black beans through the cooked rice and season with a pinch of salt – this is your beany rice

Remove the pan from the heat and keep covered

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Top half of each warmed tortilla with some beany rice, pulled chicken, shredded lettuce and a dollop of lime mayo

Grate the cheddar cheese over the top

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!


### Step 7

To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each loaded tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a burrito, then wrap them in tin foil to hold everything together – these are your chicken tinga burritos

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the chicken tinga burritos and garnish with a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!
