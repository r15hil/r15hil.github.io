## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Cut your lemon[s] in half


### Step 2

Combine your chipotle paste, tomato paste, dried oregano and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of the lemon[s]

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your peri peri sauce


### Step 3

Add half of the peri peri sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate large bowl with your diced chicken breast and mix well until they're fully coated

Chop your pepper[s] roughly

Tip: Slice into rings for speedy chopping


### Step 4

Transfer the chopped pepper to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 5-10 min or until starting to soften

Once the pepper has had an initial 5-10 min, add the coated chicken breast to the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken breast


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the remaining peri peri sauce, soft cheese and chicken stock

Cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your peri peri pasta sauce


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the cooked chicken and cooked pepper with the drained farfalle to the peri peri pasta sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Serve the peri peri chicken breast farfalle with the salad to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
