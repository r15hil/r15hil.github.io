### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Trim the woody ends off the asparagus

Drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 3

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables are tender


### Step 4

Whilst everything is in the oven, add the wheat berries to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 12-15 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, add the baby leaf spinach to the pot, stir it all together, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and chopped basil to a pestle and mortar with a generous pinch of salt and grind to a paste

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and give it a good mix up – this is your basil oil


### Step 7

Once everything is cooked, add the juices from the roasting tray to the wheat berries and stir it all together

Finely slice the cooked chicken

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges
