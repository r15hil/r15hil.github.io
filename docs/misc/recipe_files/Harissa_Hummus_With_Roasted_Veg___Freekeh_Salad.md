### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse the freekeh, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 20-25 min or until tender but with a bite, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

While the freekeh is cooking, peel and cut the red onions into wedges

Add the red onion wedges and butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and golden – this is your roasted veg

### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the chickpeas (set aside a handful of chickpeas to use for garnish!)

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Add the tahini, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a very generous pinch of salt and blitz for 1-2 min or until fully combined and smooth – this is your harissa hummus

### Step 6

Once the roasted veg is golden, add it to the pot of drained freekeh with the grated carrot and chopped mint

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted veg & freekeh salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1358.-step-7.ajpg-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to a bowl and squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon – these are your lemon-dressed leaves

### Step 8

Dollop the harissa hummus onto plates and spread it out with the back of a spoon, then sprinkle the reserved chickpeas, pumpkin seeds, black sesame seeds and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the top

Serve the lemon-dressed leaves and roasted veg & freekeh salad to the side

Enjoy!
