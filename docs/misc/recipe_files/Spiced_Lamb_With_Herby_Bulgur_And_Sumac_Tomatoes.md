## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely dice your tomato[es]

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the bulgur is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Once beginning to brown, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, ground cumin, 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> [1 tbsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-10 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened


### Step 5

Return the reserved pot with the bulgur wheat to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter

Add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add your ground allspice with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, stir through the cooked bulgur until fully combined


### Step 6

Add the diced tomatoes to a bowl with your ground sumac, half of the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – these are your sumac tomatoes


### Step 7

Add the remaining chopped coriander to the bulgur – this is your herby bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the spiced lamb over the herby bulgur

Top with the sumac tomatoes

Enjoy!
