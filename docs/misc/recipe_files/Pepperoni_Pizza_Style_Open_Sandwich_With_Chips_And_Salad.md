- Dried oregano (1tsp)

- Ciabatta x2
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min


### Step 2

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the sliced ciabatta, cut-side up, to a separate baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-6 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, remove the tray[s] from the oven


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with your dried oregano, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base


### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Spread your tomato base equally over the toasted ciabatta[s]

Top with the torn mozzarella, sliced pepperoni and a pinch of salt – these are your pepperoni pizza-style open sandwiches


### Step 6

Once the chips have had an initial 12-15 min, put the pepperoni pizza-style open sandwiches in the oven

Cook everything for a final 10-12 min or until the chips are crisp and golden and the mozzarella has melted


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Toss the salad in the balsamic dressing

### Step 8

Serve the pepperoni pizza-style open sandwiches with the chips and salad to the side

Season with a pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!
