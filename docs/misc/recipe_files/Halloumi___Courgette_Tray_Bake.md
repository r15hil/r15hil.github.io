## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until the potatoes are slightly softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely


### Step 4

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals


### Step 5

Cut your halloumi into 4 slices per person


### Step 6

After an initial 15-20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the sliced courgette and onion petals to the tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Top with the sliced halloumi

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a final 12-15 min or until everything is golden and tender – this is your halloumi & courgette tray bake


### Step 7

While everything is in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water
