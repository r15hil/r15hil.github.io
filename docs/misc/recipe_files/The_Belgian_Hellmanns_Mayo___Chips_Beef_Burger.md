## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 2 butter brioche buns
- 2 butter brioche buns
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 tsp ground paprika

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips


### Step 2

Add the chunky chips to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-8 min or until part-cooked

Meanwhile, add the shredded red cabbage to a large bowl with half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up

Set aside until serving – this is your pickled red cabbage


### Step 3

Once done, drain and lay the chips flat on a baking tray to steam dry

Tip: For extra crispy chips, carefully shake them around in the colander to fluff up the edges a little before baking


### Step 4

Once the chips have dried, add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to the chips and season with a generous pinch of salt then give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy, turning once halfway through


### Step 5

Whilst the chips are cooking, combine the mayo with the tomato paste, dried oregano, ground paprika and remaining cider vinegar

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Belgian Hellmann's mayo


### Step 6

Cut the brioche buns in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced brioche buns, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly toasted

Once done, set aside until serving


### Step 7

Season the beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, then shape into patties

Return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the patties and cook them for 5-6 min on each side or until they're cooked through

### Step 8

Build your burger by topping the base with some pickled red cabbage, a beef patty, some chunky chips, a drizzle of the Belgian Hellmann's mayo and the lid

Serve with the remaining chunky chips, pickled cabbage and Belgian Hellmann's mayo to the side

Enjoy!
