- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Black beans (390g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Black beans (185g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into thick slices

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into strips


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and chopped pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 7-8 min or until the vegetables have softened


### Step 3

While the vegetables are cooking, drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have softened, add your vegetable stock mix and ground smoked paprika to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans to the pan with a splash of cold water and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the beans are beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, mash some of the beans with a fork and stir everything together until combined – this is your smoky pepper & bean filling


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Load the warmed tortillas up with the smoky pepper & bean filling

Top with a dollop of natural yoghurt, the grated cheddar and chopped tomato

Enjoy!
