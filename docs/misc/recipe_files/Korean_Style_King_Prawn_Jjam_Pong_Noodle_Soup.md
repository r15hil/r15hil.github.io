## Ingredients

- Raw peeled king prawns (171g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Medium egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- Brown onion
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Raw peeled king prawns (85g) x0
- Gochujang paste (30g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x3
- Pak choi (200g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 2

Heat a pot with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 8-10 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water – this is your gochujang stock

Reboil a full kettle


### Step 4

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the green pak choi leaves from the stem[s]

Trim off the roots and discard, then chop the white bases in half


### Step 5

Once the onion is almost softened, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and drizzle them with a little vegetable oil to prevent them from sticking, then set aside until serving


### Step 6

Once the garlic and ginger are fragrant, add your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until toasted

Add the gochujang stock and cook for 2-3 min

Add the halved white pak choi bases and cook for 3-4 min further or until tender


### Step 7

Once tender, drain, then add your king prawns to the pot and increase the heat to medium-high, cook for 4-5 min or until pink and cooked through

Add the pak choi leaves and cook for 1 min or until wilted – this is your Korean-style king prawn jjam-pong soup

### Step 8

Serve the drained noodles and ladle over the Korean-style king prawn jjam-pong soup

Enjoy!
