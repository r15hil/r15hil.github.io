## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your lemongrass, basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and garlic

Slice your red chilli[es] in half and scrape the seeds out with a spoon, then chop your coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Add the ginger, garlic, half of your red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> water and blitz until smooth – this is your Thai-style green curry paste


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until softened


### Step 5

Once softened, add the Thai-Style green curry paste to the pan with the shallot and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water, add your fish sauce, the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your fragrant stock


### Step 6

Once fragrant, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the chopped green beans and fragrant stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened

Tip: Add an extra splash of water if the sauce thickens too quickly!


### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, cut the remaining lime into wedges

Slice the remaining chilli finely

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style green king prawn curry over the lemongrass rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
