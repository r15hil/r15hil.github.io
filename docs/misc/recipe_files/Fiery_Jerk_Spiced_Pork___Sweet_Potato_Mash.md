### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your pork steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then boil a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and bring to the boil

Cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

### Step 2

Add your pork loin steak[s] to a bowl with half your jerk paste, half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your jerk-spiced pork

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the jerk-spiced pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

While the pork is cooking, reboil half a kettle

Combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix with your mayo and the remaining white wine vinegar

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your slaw

### Step 5

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water with the remaining jerk paste, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your jerk-spiced stock

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, drain, return them to the pot

Add a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt to the potatoes and mash them until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash

Cover with a lid to keep warm until serving

### Step 7

Once the pork is done, transfer the cooked steak to a clean chopping board (reserve the pan!) and leave to rest for 2 min

Return the reserved pan to a medium-heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and stir for 30 secs

Gradually stir in the jerk-spiced stock and cook for 2 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your jerk-spiced sauce

Tip: Scrape any bits from the bottom of the pan as this will add extra flavour to the sauce!

### Step 8

Slice the rested pork

Serve the sliced pork with the sweet potato mash and slaw to the side

Drizzle the jerk-spiced sauce over the sliced pork

Enjoy!
