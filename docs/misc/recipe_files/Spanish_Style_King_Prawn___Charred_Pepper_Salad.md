## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano all over, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli


### Step 3

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, add the onion wedges and tomato wedges to the baking tray[s] with the potatoes and return to the oven for a final 15-20 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes and roasted onion & tomato


### Step 4

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – this is your charred pepper


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain your king prawns

Add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together, then add the drained king prawns to the plate and turn them several times until they're fully coated – these are your paprika king prawns


### Step 6

Once the pepper has started to char, add the paprika king prawns and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through


### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Add your salad to a the plate and top with the crispy potatoes, roasted onion & tomato, paprika king prawns and charred pepper – this is your Spanish-style king prawn & charred pepper salad

Drizzle the spicy aioli all over

Enjoy!
