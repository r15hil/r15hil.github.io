## Ingredients

- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Cooked white long grain rice (280g)
- Orange
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Soy sauce (30ml)

- Sweet pointed pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add your meat-free chick'n to a bowl with most of your cornflour (save a little for later!) and give it a good mix up until it's fully coated

Tap off any excess cornflour


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy meat-free chick'n

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the chopped pepper, ginger & garlic paste along with half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2 min or until the pepper has started to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!


### Step 6

Add the juice of half your orange[s] to a bowl along with your rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce and remaining cornflour

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix until fully combined – this is your orange sauce

Meanwhile, peel and slice the remaining orange into triangles


### Step 7

Once the pepper has softened, reduce the heat to medium

Add the orange sauce and return the crispy meat-free chick'n to the pan and cook for 1 min until the sauce has thickened and the meat-free chick'n is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky orange meat-free chick'n

Tip: If the sauce looks a little thick, add a splash of water!

### Step 8

Serve the sticky orange meat-free chick'n over the cooked rice

Top with the orange triangles

Enjoy!
