## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 2 tomatoes
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground paprika
-  280g cooked white long grain rice
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 40g Cornish clotted cream
- 200g haddock bites

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop the tomatoes into large bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min until the tomato has started to soften

Meanwhile, pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!


### Step 4

Add the curry powder, ground paprika, tomato paste and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1 min further until fragrant


### Step 5

Add 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water and the vegetable stock mix to the pan, give everything a good mix up then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and top the sauce with the haddock bites

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Once the haddock bites are cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the clotted cream â€“ this is your haddock tikka masala

### Step 8

Serve the haddock tikka masala with the basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!
