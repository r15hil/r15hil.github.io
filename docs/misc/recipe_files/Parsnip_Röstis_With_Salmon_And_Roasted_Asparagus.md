Add the onion, potato & parsnip mix to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your rösti mix

### Step 4

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Put 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> butter in a pot with the dried sage, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Heat over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted – this is your butter sauce

### Step 7

Once the butter has melted, add the salmon flakes and heat for 2 min

Bring a separate pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Crack the eggs into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea towel and season them with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the salmon flakes over the parsnip röstis

Top with a poached egg and pour over any remaining butter sauce from the pot

Serve the roasted asparagus to the side and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
