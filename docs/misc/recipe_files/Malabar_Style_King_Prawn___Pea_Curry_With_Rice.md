## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground paprika and ground fenugreek to the pan and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and half the chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened and fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy tomato stock


### Step 6

Drain your king prawns, then add to the pan with the creamy tomato stock and cook for an initial 4 min


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas and cook for a final 2 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your Malabar-style king prawn & pea curry

### Step 8

Serve the Malabar-style king prawn & pea curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
