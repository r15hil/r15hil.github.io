## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 puff pastry
- 390g cannellini beans
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 0 tinned cannellini beans
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your cheddar cheese, then drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [75ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 2

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with your chopped tomatoes, Henderson’s Relish, vegetable stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Bring to the boil over a high heat, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened – these are your beans


### Step 4

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the puff pastry into 1 rectangle per person and add to a non-stick baking paper-lined tray (or two!)


### Step 6

Divide the beans between the pastry rectangles, covering only one half and top with the sliced cheese


### Step 7

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, using a fork to crimp along the join

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden, puffed up and cooked through – this is your cheesy bean pasty[ies]

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy bean pasty with the potato wedges to the side

Enjoy!
