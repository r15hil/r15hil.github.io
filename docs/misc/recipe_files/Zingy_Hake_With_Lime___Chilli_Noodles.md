## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain the soaked noodles


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half of your red Thai curry paste (save the rest for later!) and the juice of half your lime[s] and cook for 30 secs

Add your hake fillet[s] to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through, then transfer to a plate and set aside until later (reserve the pan!) – this is your zingy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

While the hake is cooking, add your soy sauce to a bowl along with your toasted sesame oil, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining red Thai curry paste and juice of the remaining lime

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli sauce

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped spring onion, chopped green beans and half of your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 30 secs further


### Step 6

Add the lime & chilli sauce and cook for 1 min or until the green beans have softened slightly


### Step 7

Add the drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your lime & chilli noodles

### Step 8

Serve your lime & chilli noodles with the zingy hake over the top

Tear over your coriander leaves and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
