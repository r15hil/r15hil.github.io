### Step 2

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the chopped green beans to the pot

Cook, covered for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked through

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, chop the paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the paneer cubes and cook for 2-3 min until they're browned on all sides, then transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

Boil half a kettle

### Step 4

While the paneer is browning, top, tail and peel the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Stand the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh, discarding the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 5

Once the paneer is browned, return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan with the ground almonds and diced mango and increase the heat to medium-high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has started to thicken

Enjoy!
