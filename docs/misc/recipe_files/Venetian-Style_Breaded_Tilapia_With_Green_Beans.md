### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy roast potatoes

### Step 2

While the potatoes are roasting, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the lemon halves (cut-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until caramelised, then set aside for later, reserving the pan

Boil a kettle

### Step 4

Dust a clean tray or plate with a generous sprinkling of flour and season with a big pinch of salt and pepper

Dip the tilapia fillets into the seasoned flour until both sides are well coated, then shake off any excess flour

### Step 5

Wipe out the reserved pan with kitchen paper, then return to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated tilapia fillets and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Venetian-style breaded tilapia

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat

Once boiling, trim, then add the green beans and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside

### Step 7

Once the fish is cooked, add the clotted cream to the pan

Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> caramelised lemon with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your lemon sauce

Cut the remaining caramelised lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Venetian-style breaded tilapia with the crispy roast potatoes and green beans to the side

Drizzle the lemon sauce all over the fish

Garnish with a caramelised lemon wedge

Enjoy!
