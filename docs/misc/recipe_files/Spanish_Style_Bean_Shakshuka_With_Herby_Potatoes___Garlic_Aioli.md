## Ingredients

- 0 mayonnaise
- 1 butter beans
- 0 butter beans
- 1 sweet pointed pepper
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 400g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 waxy potatoes
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 0 ground coriander
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 0 ground smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 5g parsley
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into rings

Drain and rinse your butter beans


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 4

Once softened, add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to the pan with the drained butter beans, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with your vegetable stock mix, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until the vegetables are tender and the stock has thickened to a stew-like consistency


### Step 5

Combine the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with your mayo in a bowl

Season with a pinch of pepper and stir it all together – this is your garlic aioli


### Step 6

Once thickened, make 1 well per person in the pan, then crack your egg[s] into the well[s] and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your Spanish-style bean shakshuka

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter

Once hot, add the cooked potatoes to the pan cut side down and cook for 2-3 min or until golden

Once golden, add half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your herby potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the Spanish-style bean shakshuka with the herby potatoes to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle over the garlic aioli

Enjoy!
