## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- White basmati rice (65g) x0
- Curry powder (1tbsp)
- Shredded red cabbage (150g)
- Nigella seeds (1tsp)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp) x0
- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- White basmati rice (130g)
- Coriander & mint (10g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, rinse the rice under cold running water until cool


### Step 2

Meanwhile cut your meat-free chick'n into bite-sized pieces

Combine your curry powder, half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt in a bowl

Add the chopped meat-free chick'n and give everything a good mix up


### Step 3

Slice your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds using a teaspoon and discard

Slice the cucumber halves finely


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the remaining natural yoghurt and mayo to a bowl

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Peel and finely grate (or chop) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), lime zest and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the yoghurt – this is your lime & garlic yoghurt


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly browned – this is your tandoori meat-free chick'n


### Step 6

Whilst the meat-free chick'n is browning, pick your coriander and mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Chop the mint and coriander leaves roughly


### Step 7

Add the cooled rice, nigella seeds, sliced cucumber, shredded red cabbage and most of the chopped coriander and mint (save the rest for garnish!) to a large bowl

Squeeze the juice of the lime[s] into the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori meat-free chick'n over the rice salad

Drizzle the lime & garlic yoghurt all over and garnish with the remaining chopped mint & coriander

Enjoy!
