## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (30ml)
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 red chilli
- 2 butter brioche buns
- 4 white potatoes
- 10g coriander & parsley mix
- 2 x 113.5g venison & pork burger
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1 shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and a very generous grind of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper and add the venison & pork burgers to one side of the tray

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 4

Whilst the burgers are cooking, add the chopped coriander and parsley to a pestle & mortar with the red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt

Grind to a paste, then stir through the chopped shallot, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your chimichurri salsa

Tip: Alternatively blitz it all together in a food processor!


### Step 5

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Remove 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> outer leaves from the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and set aside

Chop the remaining little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters, lengthways


### Step 7

Once the burgers have had 15 min, remove the tray from the oven

Top the venison & pork burgers with the grated cheese

Slice the brioche buns and add them, cut-side up, to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the burgers are cooked through

Once done, spread the mayo over the warmed brioche bases

### Step 8

Fill each brioche bun with a little gem leaf and a cheesy venison & pork burger

Dollop over the chimichurri salsa and serve the peppery chips and little gem wedges to the side

Drizzle the little gem wedges with some olive oil

Enjoy!
