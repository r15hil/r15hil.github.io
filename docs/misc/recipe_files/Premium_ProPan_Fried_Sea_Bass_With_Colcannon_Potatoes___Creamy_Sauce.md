## Ingredients

- Tenderstem broccoli (80g) x0
- Sea bass fillet x0
- Sea bass fillets (2pcs)
- Tenderstem broccoli (160g)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Roasted garlic paste (15g)
- White potato x3
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Shredded kale (120g)
- Spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ gas 5

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on!) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min


### Step 2

While your potatoes are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, keeping the white parts and green parts separate

Wash your shredded kale and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a large splash of cold water and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite


### Step 4

While the vegetables are cooking, combine your soft cheese, vegetable stock mix, roasted garlic paste and Chinese rice wine to a jug with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml] </span>boiled water and mix until fully combined – this is your stock


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are nearly done, add the kale to the pot and cook, covered, for 3 min further or until the potatoes are tender and the kale is wilted

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the pot to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and the finely sliced white parts of the spring onion

Mash together until fully combined and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then keep covered until serving – these are your colcannon potatoes


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season on both sides with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the seasoned sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, transfer the cooked sea bass to a plate, reserve the pan

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat and add the stock and cook for 2 min or until the sauce begins to thicken to a gravy-like consistency

Once the sauce has reduced add the green parts of the spring onion stir it all together – this is your creamy pan sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cooked sea bass with the tenderstem broccoli and colcannon potatoes to the side

Spoon the creamy pan sauce over the cooked sea bass

Enjoy!
