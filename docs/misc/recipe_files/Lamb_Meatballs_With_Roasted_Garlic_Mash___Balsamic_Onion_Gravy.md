## Ingredients

- 120g shredded spring greens
- 0 125g British minced lamb
- 250g British lamb mince
- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 15g roasted garlic paste
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 4 white potatoes
- 1 carrot
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice half your red onion[s]

Peel and finely slice the remaining onion


### Step 2

Combine your lamb mince, diced onion and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide the lamb mix and shape them into 5 meatballs per person


### Step 3

Chop your potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Drain any excess oil from the pan and reserve the pan


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil, then once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add your balsamic vinegar, beef stock mix, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your lamb meatballs and balsamic onion gravy


### Step 6

Wash your shredded spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice

Add the shredded spring greens and sliced carrot to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, a splash of cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the vegetables to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray, put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender – these are your buttery vegetables


### Step 7

Return the potatoes to a low heat with your roasted garlic paste, a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your roasted garlic mash

### Step 8

Serve the lamb meatballs on top of the roasted garlic mash with the buttery vegetables to the side

Spoon over the balsamic onion gravy

Enjoy!
