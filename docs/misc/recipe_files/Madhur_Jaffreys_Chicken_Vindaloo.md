## Description

'Vindaloo implies garlic and vinegar, and this dish certainly has plenty of both. The heat balances the tartness and the Greek yoghurt balances the heat. Served with basmati rice, green beans and a mini coriander naan.' Madhur Jaffrey

## Ingredients

- 5g fresh basil
- 4 British chicken thighs
- 120g fine green beans
- 2 tsp ground paprika
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 75g basmati rice
- 1/2 tsp yellow mustard seeds
- 150g organic Greek-style yoghurt
- 8 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 2 mini coriander naans
- 1/2 tsp spicy cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 3 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Add the basmati rice and 175ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, pick the basil leaves from their stalks and discard the stalks&nbsp;


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Grind 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> black pepper into a small bowl&nbsp;


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add half the yellow mustard seeds (save the rest for later!) and cook for 10 sec or until they're beginning to pop


Once popping, add the ground fenugreek, ground black pepper and the basil leaves and cook for 10 sec&nbsp;further


### Step 4

Add the chicken thighs,&nbsp;ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, chopped garlic and half the cayenne pepper&nbsp;(can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


Add the apple&nbsp;cider vinegar,&nbsp;a generous pinch of salt&nbsp;and give everything a good stir


Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked and coated in the sauce&nbsp;- this is your chicken vindaloo


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the green beans in half&nbsp;


Heat a small pot with a matching lid over a medium-high heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the chopped green beans with a splash of water and cook, covered, for 3 min or until they're tender


Once tender, remove the lid and cook for a further 1-2 min or until all of the water has evaporated


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the mini coriander naans to a baking tray&nbsp;


Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until they're warmed through&nbsp;


Once done, remove the naans from the oven and wrap them in a tea towel to keep warm until serving


### Step 7

Once the water&nbsp;has evaporated from the green&nbsp;beans, reduce the heat to medium-low


Add&nbsp;a drizzle of vegetable oil and the remaining yellow mustard seeds and cook for 1 min or until they&nbsp;begin to pop


Remove the pan from the heat, season with a pinch of salt and the remaining cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) - these are your spiced&nbsp;green beans

### Step 8

Serve the chicken vindaloo over the basmati rice with the&nbsp;spiced green beans,&nbsp;Greek-style yoghurt and warm&nbsp;naan&nbsp;to the side&nbsp;


Enjoy!&nbsp;
