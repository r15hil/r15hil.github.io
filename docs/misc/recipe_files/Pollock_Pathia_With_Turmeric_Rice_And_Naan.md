## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste
- 2 mini garlic & coriander naans
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 100g basmati rice
- 2 x 120g pollock fillets
- 15g tamarind paste
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, garlic and ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a pot with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until sizzling

Once the cumin seeds start to sizzle, carefully add the basmati rice and stir it all together


### Step 3

Add the ground turmeric and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your turmeric rice


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Chop the pollock fillets into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the ground cumin, curry powder and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the tomato paste and stir it all together

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if the pan looks a little dry


### Step 6

Add the tamarind paste with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce is beginning to thicken

Add the chopped pollock and cook for 3-4 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your pollock pathia

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the fish is almost cooked, add the mini garlic & coriander naans to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the naans are warm

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naans once they are out of the oven

Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the pollock pathia with the turmeric rice and warmed naans to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
