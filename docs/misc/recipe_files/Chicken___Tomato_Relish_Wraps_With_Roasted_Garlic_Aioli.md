- Tomato x2
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Roasted garlic paste (15g)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and the onion wedges to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6 min or until the onion is slightly softened


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred


### Step 4

Add your mayo and roasted garlic paste in a bowl with half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted garlic aioli


### Step 5

Once the onion is slightly softened, add your ground smoked paprika to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and the remaining white wine vinegar to the pan with your sweet pepper relish, chopped tomato and a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the tomato is slightly softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & tomato relish


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Top each warmed tortilla with the shredded lettuce and the chicken & tomato relish

Drizzle the roasted garlic aioli all over

Enjoy!
