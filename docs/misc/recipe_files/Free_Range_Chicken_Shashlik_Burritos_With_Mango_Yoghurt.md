### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice, sultanas, ground turmeric, chicken stock mix and 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your pilau rice

### Step 2

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Slice your chicken breast portion[s] into 4 strips per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chicken breast strips and cook for 5-6 min further until starting to brown

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your mango chutney, nigella seeds and natural yoghurt to a small bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your mango yoghurt

### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add your curry powder, ground smoked paprika and a splash of cold water and cook for 5-6 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your curried chicken & onions

### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, add your tortillas to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

Wash, then shred your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Slice your tomato[es] into wedges

### Step 7

Top half of each warmed tortilla with the pilau rice, curried chicken & onions, shredded lettuce and tomato wedges

Dollop the mango yoghurt over the top

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!

### Step 8

To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a burrito – these are your chicken shashlik burritos

Wrap the burritos in tin foil to hold everything together, then slice them in half

Enjoy!
