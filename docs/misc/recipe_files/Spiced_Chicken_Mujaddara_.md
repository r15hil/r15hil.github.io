## Description

Mujadarra is a delicious Middle-Eastern combination of nutty rice, peppery lentils, sweet and sticky caramelised onions and a dollop of cool yoghurt. Legend has it that the unique combination of textures and flavours yields magical powers - weâ€™re not sure of the validity of this theory but it sure is addictive!
