## Ingredients

- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Mustard ketchup (20g)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Crispy onions (15g)
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- British free range egg x2
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes, then add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are brown and crispy – these are your crispy paprika potatoes


### Step 2

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and slice into quarters

Add the lettuce quarters to a bowl with your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – these are your dressed lettuce quarters


### Step 3

Line a baking tray with tin foil

Add your meat-free burger patty[ies] and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your mustard ketchup and mayo in a small bowl – this is your burger sauce


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are nearly cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push them to one side

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them, cut side up, to the other side of the tray[s] and put back in the oven for 4-5 min to warm through


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 7

To build, fill the warmed brioche with some burger sauce, a meat-free burger patty, a fried egg and a sprinkling of crispy onions – this is your herby veggie egg burger

### Step 8

Serve the herby veggie egg burger with the crispy paprika potatoes and the dressed lettuce quarters to the side

Enjoy!
