### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock

### Step 4

Once the chicken is lightly browned, reduce the heat to medium-low and add a knob of butter with the chopped garlic and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your ground smoked paprika, garam masala and curry powder and cook for 1 min or until very fragrant and the butter has melted

### Step 5

Add the stock and your chopped tomatoes to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice lengthways finely – this is your julienne chilli

Wash your spinach

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the spinach and your clotted cream (save a generous dollop for a garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a final 1 min or until the spinach was wilted – this is your ruby chicken curry

### Step 8

Serve the ruby chicken curry and top with the julienne chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
