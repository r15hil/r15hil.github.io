Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 70ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [120ml]</span> boiled water

Top with the torn mozzarella and put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until melted and bubbling and the meatballs is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your cheesy meatballs

Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing

Once slightly toasted, spread each slice with butter and top with the remaining garlic, then return to the oven for a further 3-4 min

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and tear into large bite-sized pieces

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy meatballs with the garlic ciabatta and torn lettuce to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the lettuce

Enjoy!
