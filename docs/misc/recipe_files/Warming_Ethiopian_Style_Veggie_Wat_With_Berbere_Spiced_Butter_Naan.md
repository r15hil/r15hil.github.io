## Ingredients

- 0 tomato paste
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tbsp berbere seasoning
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 2 plain naans
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 1 sweet potato
- 1 British free-range egg
- 5g parsley
- 1 aubergine
- 1 brown onion
- 100g red lentils

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take a knob of butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large pot with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine and sweet potato to the pan with the sliced onion and a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine a pinch of your berbere seasoning with the softened butter in a bowl and mix it all together, then set aside – this is your berbere-spiced butter

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Once the onion has softened, add the remaining berbere seasoning and tomato paste to the pot with your ginger & garlic paste and give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils and vegetable stock mix to the pot with 500ml<span class="text-purple"> [700ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to medium

Cook for a further 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender and the sweet potatoes are fork-tender – this is your Ethiopian-style veggie wat

While everything's cooking, reboil the kettle


### Step 5

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a small pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the egg from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the soft-boiled egg[s] to the bowl until cooled

Set aside, then once cooled, peel the cooled soft-boiled egg[s] and cut them in half


### Step 6

When the sweet potatoes are nearly fork-tender, add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Once done, remove the warmed naan from the toaster and add the berbere-spiced butter – this is your berbere-spiced butter naan

### Step 8

Serve the Ethiopian-style veggie wat in bowls and top with a soft-boiled egg half

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Serve the berbere-spiced butter naan to the side

Enjoy!
