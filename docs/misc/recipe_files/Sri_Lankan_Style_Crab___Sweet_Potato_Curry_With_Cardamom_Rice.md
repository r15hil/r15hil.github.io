## Ingredients

- 0 British white crab meat
- 0 white basmati rice
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 British white crab meat
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 130g basmati rice
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 green chilli
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 3 cardamom pods
- 1 sweet potato
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften and brown


### Step 3

Whilst the onion is softening, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and chopped creamed coconut in 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan with your curry powder, ground turmeric and ground cinnamon

Cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped sweet potato with the coconut stock and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice, cardamom pods, 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice


### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is tender, break up your crab meat gently with a fork, then stir it through the sauce – this is your Sri Lankan-style crab & sweet potato curry

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style crab & sweet potato curry with the cardamom rice to the side (discard any cardamom pods!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the green chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
