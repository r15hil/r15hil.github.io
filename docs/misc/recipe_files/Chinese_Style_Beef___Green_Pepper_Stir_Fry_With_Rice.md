### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high, then add your beef mince to the pan and cook over a high heat for 5 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

While the beef mince is browning, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper to the pan (freshly ground is best!)

Reduce the heat to medium and add your Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 3-4 min or until thickened and sticky and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Chinese-style beef & green pepper stir-fry
