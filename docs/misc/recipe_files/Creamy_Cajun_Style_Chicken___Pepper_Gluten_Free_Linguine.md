## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of sugar and salt and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix


### Step 2

Press one side of your chicken breast portion[s] into the Cajun-style spice mix and save the rest of the spice mix for later – this is your Cajun-style spiced chicken


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the Cajun-style spiced chicken, spice-side down, and cook for 3 min or until slightly charred

Once charred, transfer the chicken, spice-side up, to a baking tray (reserve the pan for later), then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced red onion, chopped garlic, pepper strips and remaining Cajun-style spice mix and cook for 8-10 min or until starting to soften


### Step 6

Add your gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock


### Step 7

Once the veg has softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated

Add the creamy stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

Once thickened, add the drained linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy Cajun-style pepper gluten free linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Slice the cooked spiced chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced spiced chicken over the creamy Cajun-style pepper gluten free linguine

Season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
