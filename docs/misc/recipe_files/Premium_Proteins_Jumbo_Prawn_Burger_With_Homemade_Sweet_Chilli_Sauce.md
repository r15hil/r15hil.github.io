## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are in the oven, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the grated ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), Chinese rice wine, half your rice vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> sugar to a pot with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [180ml] </span>cold water

### Step 3

Add the pot to a medium-high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook for 15-20 min or until it has reduced to a sticky, syrup like consistency – this is your homemade sweet chilli sauce

While the chilli sauce is cooking, top, tail and grate your carrot[s], then top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Add the grated carrot and sliced radishes to a bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – this is your pickled salad

### Step 4

Drain, then pat your jumbo prawns dry with kitchen paper

Add a handful of flour to a bowl

Crack your egg[s] into a separate bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate bowl

### Step 5

Coat the jumbo prawns in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted, set aside until serving and reserve the pan

### Step 6

When the chips are almost ready, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan)

Once hot, add the breaded jumbo prawns and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your crispy jumbo prawns

Tip: Do the prawns in batches if you need to so you don't overcrowd the pan!

### Step 7

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped coriander and mint to the pickled salad and mix everything together – this is your fragrant pickled salad

### Step 8

Spread each toasted brioche base and lid with mayo, then add a dollop of homemade sweet chilli sauce to the base with the crispy jumbo prawns, some fragrant pickled salad and top with a toasted brioche lid – this is your jumbo prawn burger with homemade sweet chilli sauce

Serve with the remaining fragrant pickled salad and chips to the side

Sprinkle your shichimi togarashi all over the chips and enjoy!
