### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Top, tail, peel and grate half your carrot[s], then slice the remaining carrot into discs on the diagonal

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely dice the remaining chilli (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

### Step 2

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with the grated carrot, chopped garlic and your soy sauce

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tsp]</span> flour and mix thoroughly to combine – this is your spring roll filling

### Step 3

Add your tortillas to a clean board and spoon the spring roll filling evenly between them in the lower half of the tortillas, leaving space around the edges to fold

Fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a tight wrap (like a burrito!)

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don’t overfill the wraps!

### Step 4

Add the wraps to a baking paper-lined baking tray (seam-side down)

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 19-20 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your crispy pork spring roll wraps

### Step 5

When the spring roll wraps have 12 min left, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the carrot discs and halved Tenderstem with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until slightly softened

Boil half a kettle

### Step 6

Once slightly softened, add your mangetout and cook for a final 4-5 min or until tender with a slight bite – this is your stir-fried veg

### Step 7

When everything's nearly ready, add your cornflour and red chilli relish to a small bowl with a pinch of salt and gradually stir in 80ml<span class="text-purple"> [110ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [130ml]</span> boiled water (this is to ensure there's no lumps!) – this is your sweet chilli mix

Put the sweet chilli mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring half way, then add the diced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your sweet chilli sauce

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the fresh chilli!</span>

### Step 8

Serve the crispy pork spring roll wraps with the stir-fried veg and sweet chilli sauce to the side

Garnish the stir fried veg with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)
