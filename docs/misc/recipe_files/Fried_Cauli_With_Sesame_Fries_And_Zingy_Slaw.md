Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated cauliflower and cook for 10-12 min, turning occasionally, or until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside – this is your fried cauli

Sprinkle the fries with the sesame seeds – these are your sesame fries

### Step 8

Serve the fried cauli with the sesame fries and zingy slaw to the side and the hoisin mayo for dipping

Enjoy!
