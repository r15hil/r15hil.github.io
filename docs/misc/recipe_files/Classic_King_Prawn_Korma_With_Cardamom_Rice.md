### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Heat a pot with a lid, with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the crushed cardamom pod[s] and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and a pinch of salt to the pot and cook for a further 1 min, then add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-size pieces

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add your ginger paste, curry powder and the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 6

Add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until a thick sauce remains

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1660823288903-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Drain your king prawns

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained king prawns and chopped green beans then cook for a further 4-5 min or until the prawns are fully cooked and the beans are tender

Season generously with both salt and pepper – this is your king prawn korma

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn korma over the cardamom rice (discard the cardamom pod[s]!) and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
