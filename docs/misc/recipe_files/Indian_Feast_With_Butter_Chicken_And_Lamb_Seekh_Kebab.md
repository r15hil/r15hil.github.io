## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and dice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>brown onion[s] as finely as you can

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems and chop both the mint and coriander roughly

Combine your lamb mince in a large bowl with the diced onion, half your ginger & garlic paste, half your garam masala, half of the chopped coriander and mint (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then set aside – this is your seekh kebab mixture


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice the remaining brown onions

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add half of the sliced onions, 1/3 of your ground turmeric, half of the remaining garam masala and half<span class="text-danger"> </span>of the remaining ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate large bowl

Add your gram flour with a generous pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water and massage for 30 secs adding an extra splash of water if its looking a bit dry

Scoop out 2 handfuls of the mixture per person, shape into rough bhaji shapes and add to the tray (or two!)

Drizzle the onion bhajis with a little vegetable oil then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 3

While the bhajis are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened

Meanwhile, cut your chicken breast portion[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken to a bowl with 1/3 of the ground<span class="text-danger"> </span>turmeric and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of natural yoghurt, mix up and set aside to marinate (save the rest of the yoghurt for later!)


### Step 4

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low, sprinkle over the remaining ground turmeric and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your turmeric rice


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the remaining ginger & garlic paste and remaining garam masala to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if it's looking a little dry!

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan with the onions and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until thickened slightly – this is your curry base


### Step 6

Once the bhajis are golden and crispy, move the tray[s] to the bottom of the oven to keep warm, then preheat the grill to medium-high

Divide the seekh kebab mixture  and roll into 2 sausage shapes per person

Tip: Wet your hands to stop the mince sticking to them!

Lightly oil a baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil and add the seekh kebabs and sweet pointed pepper[s] (no need to chop!)

Put the tray[s] under the grill for 12-15 min, turning everything halfway, or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and everything is starting to char

Once cooked, carefully slice your pepper[s] in half widthways


### Step 7

Once the curry base has thickened slightly, add the marinated chicken to the pan, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the chicken is cooking, combine half<span class="text-danger"> </span>your natural yoghurt with the remaining chopped mint and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your mint raita

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the remaining natural yoghurt – this is your butter chicken

Serve the butter chicken, lamb seekh kebabs, pepper halves and onion bhajis with the mint raita, turmeric rice and toasted naans to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish the lamb seekh kebabs with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
