### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

### Step 2

Add the pepper strips and chicken breast strips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the pepper has softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce

### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Add your pizza base[s] to baking tray[s]

Divide the pizza sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella

### Step 6

Once the chicken and peppers are cooked, remove the tray<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred into rough, bite-sized pieces using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

### Step 7

Top the pizzas with the pulled chicken and roasted pepper

Sprinkle over your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your spicy chicken & roasted pepper pizzas

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the spicy chicken & roasted pepper pizzas

Garnish with a handful of salad

Enjoy!
