## Description

Uova al Purgatorio (eggs in purgatory) is a popular Italian dish of eggs baked in a spicy tomato sauce. We've spiced them up with 'Nduja sausage for a punchy Calabrian twist, to add heaps of sizzle and prove eggs aren't just for breakfast!

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock
