## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the dish and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned


### Step 2

Peel and cut your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once browned, add the onion wedges to the dish with your ginger & garlic paste, garam masala, half your ground turmeric (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt

Add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling put the dish in the oven and cook, covered, for an initial 35 min


### Step 3

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop

Take some butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften


### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat and once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden (reserve the pan!)

Once golden, add half the toasted coconut (you’ll use the rest later!) to a pestle & mortar and bash into a powder (as finely as you can!)

Mix the crushed coconut with your sultanas and nigella seeds – this is your peshwari filling


### Step 5

Add your pizza base mix and peshwari filling to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (careful, you may not need all of it!), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and cut into 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>balls per person

Press each dough ball out into an oval disc with your fingers – these are your naans


### Step 6

Wash your spinach

After 35 min, remove the dish from the oven, and add the spinach

Give everything a good mix up and return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for a final 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened


### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat the reserved pan over a high heat

Once hot, add your naans to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until puffed up and golden brown

While the naans are cooking, mix together a knob of butter, the remaining ground turmeric and a pinch of<span class="text-danger"> </span>sugar – this is your masala butter

Once the naans are cooked through and golden brown, brush the masala butter over the top – these are your homemade peshwari naans

### Step 8

Once thickened, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your clotted cream – this is your baked chicken breast saag

Serve the baked chicken breast saag alongside the homemade peshwari naans

Garnish with the remaining toasted coconut flakes

Enjoy!
