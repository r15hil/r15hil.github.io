### Step 1

Smash your cucumber with a rolling pin then chop it into large, bite-sized pieces

Tip: By bruising the cucumber the water is drawn out more easily

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Combine the smashed cucumber and grated carrot in a bowl with a pinch of salt and set aside

### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Grate your chestnut mushrooms

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the grated mushrooms, chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 7-8 min or until beginning to brown

Add your soy sauce and honey and cook for 1 min further – these are your sweet & salty mushrooms

### Step 5

Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, drain any excess water from the smashed cucumber and grated carrot

Return the drained veg to the bowl and add your rice vinegar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled veg

### Step 6

Transfer the sweet & salty mushrooms to a bowl and return the pan (no need to wash it!) to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Boil a kettle

### Step 7

Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and miso paste with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of cold water in a bowl – this is your spicy miso sauce

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water

Once cool, squeeze any excess water out of the spinach then combine with your toasted sesame oil

### Step 8

Serve the basmati rice and arrange the sweet & salty mushrooms, sesame spinach and quick-pickled veg on top

Top with a fried egg and a drizzle of the spicy miso sauce

Enjoy!
