## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice


### Step 3

Heat a hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Drain your pineapple slices (save the juice!) and chop roughly


### Step 4

Once hot, add the onion wedges and yellow mustard seeds with your curry powder, ground turmeric and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your butternut squash cubes and the chopped pineapple with the reserved pineapple juice

Add your cashews, lime leaf[ves], vegetable stock mix, ginger & garlic paste, creamed coconut and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[300ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 22 min or until the butternut squash is tender


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the butternut squash is tender, remove the dish from the oven and add your mangetout

Give everything a good mix up, cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 2-3 min or until the mangetout is tender – this is your Sri Lankan-style pineapple, cashew & coconut curry

Discard the lime leaf[ves]

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style pineapple, cashew & coconut curry with the baked rice to the side
