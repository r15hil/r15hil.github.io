## Ingredients

- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Gluten free linguine (190g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Cornish clotted cream (40g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gluten free linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the gluten free linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown and crisp


### Step 4

Roughly chop your cherry tomatoes


### Step 5

Combine the juice of half your lemon[s] with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your zingy dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with the chopped cherry tomatoes

Add the zingy dressing and give it a gentle mix up – this is your zingy salad


### Step 6

Once the chorizo has crisped, reduce the heat to medium and add your ground smoked paprika, chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the drained gluten free linguine with a few splashes of starchy pasta water


### Step 7

Add your clotted cream and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Tip: Add more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Add a squeeze of lemon and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chorizo & lemon gluten free linguine

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo & lemon gluten free linguine topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Serve the zingy salad to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
