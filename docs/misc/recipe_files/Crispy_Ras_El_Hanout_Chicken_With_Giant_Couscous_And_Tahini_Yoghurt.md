### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season generously with salt and your ras el hanout

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over medium-high heat, then once hot, add the seasoned chicken, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

### Step 2

Transfer the crispy chicken to a baking tray (skin side up), reserve the pan

Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 450ml <span class="text-purple">[680ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml] </span>boiled water

### Step 4

Once the veg has softened, add the chopped garlic with your tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your giant couscous and the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 12-14 min or until all the water has absorbed and the giant couscous is tender

### Step 5

While the couscous is cooking, put the tray with the chicken in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy ras el hanout chicken

### Step 6

Whilst everything is cooking, add your tahini to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water and mix until fully combined and smooth

Add your natural yoghurt with a pinch of salt, then stir it all together – this is your tahini yoghurt

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 7

Once the giant couscous is tender, add your diced apricots and the juice of half your lemon[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the crispy ras el hanout chicken over the giant couscous

Drizzle over the tahini yoghurt, season with a grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Tip: Drizzle over all the juices and caramelised bits from the chicken tray!

Enjoy!
