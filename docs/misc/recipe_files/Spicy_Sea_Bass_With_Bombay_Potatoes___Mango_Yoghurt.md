### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 7 min or until soft and starting to caramelise

### Step 2

While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Trim your green beans

Boil a kettle

### Step 3

Combine your natural yoghurt in a small bowl with your mango chutney – this is your mango yoghurt

### Step 4

Once the onions have caramelised, add the chopped potatoes, garlic and garam masala with chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and half of your nigella seeds (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 2 min until or fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water - this is your stock

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the stock to the potatoes and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Reboil a kettle

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add a knob of butter and cook for a final 5 min, uncovered, or until the sauce is thick - these are your Bombay potatoes

Tip: If it's looking a little dry, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce!

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are nearly ready, pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season on both sides with your curry powder and a pinch of salt

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through – this is your spicy sea bass

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

While the sea bass is cooking, add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pan with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and keep covered until serving – these are your buttery greens

### Step 8

Serve the mango yoghurt over the Bombay potatoes and sprinkle with the remaining nigella seeds

Serve the spicy sea bass to the side with the buttery greens

Enjoy!
