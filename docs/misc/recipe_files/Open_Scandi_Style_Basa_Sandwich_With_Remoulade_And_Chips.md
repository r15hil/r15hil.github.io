## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Chop<span class="text-danger"> </span>your capers finely


### Step 3

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine the sliced spring onion, mayo, chopped capers, Dijon mustard, chopped dill and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar in a bowl – this is your remoulade

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, separate the leaves and set aside


### Step 4

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and whisk

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate large bowl with a pinch of salt and mix it up


### Step 5

Coat your basa fillet[s] in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press it into your panko breadcrumbs firmly to coat everything evenly – this is your breaded basa


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Once hot, add the ciabatta half[ves], cut-side-down and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted

Once toasted, transfer the ciabatta to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the breaded basa and cook for 4-5 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Top the toasted ciabatta half with the lettuce leaves, a dollop of remoulade and the breaded basa – this is your open Scandi-style basa sandwich

Serve the open Scandi-style basa sandwich with the chips and any remaining remoulade to the side

Enjoy!
