### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and dice your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Soak your skewers in water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add the diced sweet potato to the pan and cook for 5 min for until lightly browned

Once lightly browned, add the sliced shallot and cook for 3-4 min further or until slightly softened

### Step 3

Once the shallot has softened, add the chopped garlic, tomato paste and half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and mix everything together

Add your basmati rice with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water and a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until later

### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your paneer into small bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs

Add the chopped paneer and courgette discs to a large bowl with the mango chutney, remaining curry powder, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is you marinated paneer & courgette

### Step 5

Heat the grill to medium-high

Thread the marinated paneer & courgette onto the soaked skewers and add them to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray under the grill for 8-12 min, turning once halfway, or until slightly charred – these are your mango paneer & courgette skewers

### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander yoghurt

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop finely

Once the paneer skewers are almost ready, return the basmati rice to a low heat then add the chopped spinach and remaining chopped coriander

Stir everything together and cook for 1 min or until the spinach has slightly wilted – this is your saag sweet potato rice

### Step 8

Serve the saag sweet potato rice and top with the mango paneer & courgette skewers and a dollop of coriander yoghurt

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
