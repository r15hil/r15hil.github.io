### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and slice your brown onion[s] into wedges

### Step 3

Add your lamb mince to the dish and break it up into rough, large chunks and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly browned all over

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

### Step 4

Add the onion wedges, carrot discs, dried oregano and tomato paste to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water with your beef stock mix, chopped tomatoes and Henderson's Relish and season generously with salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then top with the chopped potatoes

### Step 5

Put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 30 min or until the potatoes are tender and everything's cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 6

After 30 min remove the lid from the dish and return it to the oven, uncovered, for a final 18-20 min or until the liquid has reduced and the potatoes are lightly coloured – this is your chunky shepherd's pie

Meanwhile, cut a<span class="text-danger"> </span>piece of tin foil (or two!) approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper

Wash, then add your shredded spring greens to the middle with a few small knobs of butter and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1636455336760-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the greens are tender – these are your buttery greens

### Step 8

Serve the chunky shepherd's pie with the buttery greens to the side

Dig in!
