## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to a high heat then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your nigella rice


### Step 2

Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Combine half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and your curry powder in a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Add the chopped chicken pieces and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 4

Cover a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil (to avoid mess!)

Add the coated chicken to the baking tray[s] and put it under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through and starting to char (no pink meat!) – this is your free range tandoori chicken


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways

Scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and set aside for later, then dice the rest

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Dice your tomato[es]


### Step 6

Combine the diced cucumber, tomato and shallot in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your kachumber salad


### Step 7

Combine the cucumber seeds and the remaining natural yoghurt in a bowl with your mint sauce

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your mint raita

### Step 8

Serve the free range tandoori chicken over the nigella rice with the mint raita and kachumber salad to the side

Enjoy!
