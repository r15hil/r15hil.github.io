### Step 1

Add your curry powder, ground turmeric and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then crumble it with your fingers into the bowl, then toss in the spices until nicely coated

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Pick your mint leaves from their stalks and chop finely, discard the stalks

### Step 4

Add the chopped coriander and mint to a pestle & mortar with a small squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt

Grind to a fine paste, then add your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your mint chutney

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything very finely!

### Step 5

Dice your tomato[es]

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with your nigella seeds, remaining sliced onion and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high

Add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown

Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon and mix to combine – this is your spiced tofu

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

While the tofu is cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, and once hot, remove the pan from the heat, then add your spinach

Return the pan to the heat, stir for 1 min or until the spinach is beginning to wilt very slightly, then remove from the heat

### Step 8

Serve the warmed tortillas topped with the wilted spinach, spiced tofu and tomato salad

Drizzle over the mint chutney

Enjoy!
