### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 2

Once the rice is done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Add the Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a large splash of cold water and a large knob of butter and add to a baking tray

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the Tenderstem to form a sealed parcel, then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Juice half of your lemon[s] into a bowl and cut 2 slices per person with your remaining lemon

Add your honey, a sprinkle of your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!), half of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon sauce

### Step 4

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] lengthways into 2 strips per person, then cut each strip in half

Add the remaining cornflour to a bowl along with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, your five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together

Add the chicken strips to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until all the chicken is coated

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken strips along with the remaining soy sauce and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden, crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside (save the pan!)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1609760053874-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Stir the sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the cooked rice – this is your chilli rice

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1609760068906-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the lemon sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce is thick and sticky

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chicken and roasted Tenderstem broccoli over the chilli rice

Drizzle the lemon sauce over the chicken and garnish with the reserved lemon slices and your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
