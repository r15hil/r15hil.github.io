## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and your cumin seeds

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your cumin spiced chips


### Step 2

Drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to a bowl with your curry powder and a drizzle of vegetable oil then give everything a good mix up

Transfer the coated jumbo prawns to a tin foil-lined tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until the prawns are cooked through

Once cooked, set aside to cool


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Add the sliced cucumber and chopped tomato to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a drizzle of vegetable oil and mix well – this is your tomato & cucumber salad


### Step 4

Once cooled, add the cooked prawns to a bowl with your mayo and mango chutney and mix well – this is your curried jumbo prawn mayo


### Step 5

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s] (as finely as you can!)

Add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour to a bowl along with your cornflour, garam masala, ground turmeric and a pinch of salt

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water and mix thoroughly to a smooth, thick batter

Add the sliced onion to the bowl with the batter and mix until all of the onion is coated – this is your onion bhaji mixture


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to fully coat the bottom of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, divide the onion bhaji mixture equally into 1 bhaji per person and add to the pan

Press down with the back of a spoon to flatten into a patty shape


### Step 7

Cook for 3-4 min on each side until crispy and golden – this is your onion bhaji

Meanwhile, put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until it is hot and crusty, carefully slice in half before serving

### Step 8

Assemble your sandwich with a little tomato & cucumber salad on the ciabatta base, then top with the curried jumbo prawn mayo and an onion bhaji then place the ciabatta lid on top

Serve the remaining tomato & cucumber salad and cumin spiced chips to the side

Enjoy!
