### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Combine your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!), vegetable stock mix, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of black pepper in a bowl

Mix everything together until the breadcrumbs are fully incorporated – this is your pork filling

### Step 2

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into rectangle[s] (1 per person!)

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s]

Divide the pork filling equally and press into a sausage shape (1 per person) and lay in the middle of the pastry rectangle[s]

### Step 3

Add half your cranberry sauce (you’ll use the rest later) to a small bowl with your Dijon mustard and mix it all together – this is your cranberry mustard

Top the pork filling with the cranberry mustard

### Step 4

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Fold one side of the pastry tightly over the pork filling and roll until the filling is encased by the pastry

Place the seal-side underneath, press the open ends together with your fingers to seal in the mixture, then crimp with the sealed edges with a fork – this is your sausage roll[s]

Score the top of the sausage roll[s] with a sharp knife and sprinkle over half your dried sage (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

### Step 5

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to separate a baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil, the remaining dried sage and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the trays in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are crispy and the sausage roll[s] are golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

While everything is cooking, combine the remaining cranberry sauce and your tomato ketchup in a small bowl – this is your cranberry ketchup

### Step 7

Boil a kettle

Once everything has been in the oven for about 20 mins, trim your green beans

Add the green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender and once done, drain

### Step 8

Serve the sausage roll with the cooked potatoes, green beans and cranberry ketchup to the side

Enjoy!
