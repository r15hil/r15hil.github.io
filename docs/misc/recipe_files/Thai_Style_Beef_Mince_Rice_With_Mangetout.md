## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and sprinkle in your beef stock mix

Cook for 3-4 min or until the beef has browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Add your mangetout to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Add your red Thai curry paste, ginger paste and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste, a pinch of sugar and a small splash of water to the pan and mix until everything is combined

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Add your cooked white long grain rice to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Stir through half of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) and the juice of half your lime[s]

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice is piping hot and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Thai-style beef mince rice with mangetout

Note: Please make sure you cook your beef thoroughly as cooking equipment varies!

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style beef mince rice with mangetout and garnish with the reserved chopped basil, a lime wedge and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
