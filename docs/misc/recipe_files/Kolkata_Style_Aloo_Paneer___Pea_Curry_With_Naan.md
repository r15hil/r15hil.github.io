### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop the waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the paneer into small bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown, then transfer to a plate and set aside until later, reserve the pan

### Step 3

While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>roughly

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger, sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garam masala and curry powder and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato, tomato stock, drained potatoes and the browned paneer

Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency and the potatoes are cooked through

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the mini garlic & coriander naans to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through, then butter once out of the toaster

### Step 7

Once the sauce has reduced, add the blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once the peas are warmed through, remove the pan from the heat and stir through half the natural yoghurt (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your Kolkata-style aloo paneer & pea curry

### Step 8

Serve the Kolkata-style aloo paneer & pea curry with the buttered naan to the side

Dollop over the remaining yoghurt

Enjoy!
