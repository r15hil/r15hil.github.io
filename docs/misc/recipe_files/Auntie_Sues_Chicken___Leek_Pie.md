## Description

Creamy and hearty, this delicious Chicken and Leek Pie is a homage to the comfort food of our childhood. Sweet caramelised leeks make up the sauce, which has a kick of wholegrain mustard, as well as the earth notes of thyme to take this pie to the next level. Pie not?

## Ingredients

- 120g trimmed fine green beans
- 2 carrots
- 21g wholegrain mustard
- 320g British chicken thighs
- 1 leek 
- 400g potatoes
- 5g thyme

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6 and boil a kettle


Meanwhile, wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced leeks and cook for 6-7 min or until they've softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-<span class="text-highlight">sized</span> pieces


Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot


Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a large knob of butter and mash until smooth


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the chicken <span class="text-highlight">thighs</span> into bite-sized pieces


Once the leeks have softened, add the chopped chicken to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min


Strip the thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the pan (don't worry if some of the stalks make it into the pan <span class="text-highlight">too)</span>


### Step 4

Add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter to the pan


Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min


Gradually stir in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk and cook for 3-4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains 


Add the wholegrain mustard and season with a pinch of salt and pepper <span class="text-highlight">–</span> this is your chicken and leek mixture


### Step 5

Pour the chicken and leek mixture into the base of an oven-proof dish 


Spread the mash evenly on top and run a fork over the top to give it <span class="text-highlight">an</span> extra <span class="text-highlight">crunch</span>


Put the dish in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until it's golden and bubbling


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wipe the pan clean


Top, tail, peel and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways


Cut at an angle into small bite-sized pieces


Boil a kettle


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the chopped carrot and cook for 3-4 min or until it's starting to brown


Once the carrots are lightly browned, add the green beans with a knob of butter, a pinch of salt and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water


Cook, covered, for 8-9 min or until the carrots are tender

### Step 8

Serve the cooked chicken and leek pie with the vegetables to the side


Enjoy!
