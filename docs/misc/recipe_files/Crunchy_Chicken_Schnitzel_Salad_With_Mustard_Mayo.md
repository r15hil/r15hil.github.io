## Ingredients

- Dijon mustard (18g)
- 40g panko breadcrumbs (40g)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Dijon mustard (5.5g) x0
- Apple
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- White potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board and cover with cling film

Bash the chicken breast portion[s] with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your chicken escalope


### Step 3

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Spread most of your Dijon mustard (save the rest for later!) over both sides of the chicken escalope using the back of a spoon

Press the chicken escalope into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken schnitzel

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, chop your apple[s] into thin wedges and remove the core[s]

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Combine the remaining Dijon mustard, your mayo, cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your mustard mayo


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are golden and crisp, transfer them to a large bowl

Add the chopped apple and chopped cucumber to the bowl with the salad and half the mustard mayo (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

Slice the chicken schnitzel finely on a clean chopping board

### Step 8

Serve the crunchy salad and top with the sliced chicken schnitzel

Drizzle over the remaining mustard mayo

Enjoy!
