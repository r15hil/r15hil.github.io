## Ingredients

- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 2g shichimi togarashi
- 15ml mirin
- 80g spinach
- 300g steamed white basmati rice
- 30ml soy sauce
- 25g honey
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until golden and slightly charred


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Combine the remaining soy sauce, honey and mirin with 80ml <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> boiled water – this is your honey mirin sauce


### Step 5

Once the chicken is golden, turn the heat down to medium-high and add the sliced pepper with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min further or until the pepper is beginning to soften

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the pepper has slightly softened, add the spinach, sugar snap peas and honey mirin sauce to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Japanese-style chicken & sugar snap stir-fry


### Step 7

Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 3 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the Japanese-style chicken & sugar snap stir-fry with the steamed rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Sprinkle the shichimi togarashi over the rice

Enjoy!
