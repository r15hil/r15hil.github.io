Slice the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Cut the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate!) the garlic


Combine the Dijon mustard, chopped garlic and dried oregano with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your mustard marinade


### Step 3

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper 


Lay the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the middle of 2 pieces (doubling it up prevents any leakages!) and add the parcels to a baking tray


Spoon the mustard marinade over the chicken evenly


### Step 4

Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the chicken to form a sealed parcel


Put the baking tray in the oven for 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through <span class="text-highlight">(no pink meat!)</span>


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the chopped sweet potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and give them a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven and cook for an initial 15 min


Once the sweet potatoes have been in for 15 min, add the sliced courgette and cherry tomatoes and cook for 10-15 min further or until all the vegetables are soft


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat


Once hot, add the pine nuts and cook for 3-4 min or until golden 


Tip: watch like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!  


Chop the basil leaves finely, discarding the stalks


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are soft, add the pine nuts and chopped basil and give everything a good mix up


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Slice the cooked chicken finely


Serve the sliced chicken over the vegetables and pour over any remaining juices


Enjoy!
