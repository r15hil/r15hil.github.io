### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and your ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

Whilst the fries are cooking, add your ground cumin, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a plate

Gently stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to the plate and turn several times until fully coated in the spice mix

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your mayo and white wine vinegar in a bowl and set aside for later – this is your zingy mayo

### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Flip the chicken occasionally to keep it moist!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 2 outer leaves per person and shred the inner core

Dice your tomato[es]

Cut your bread roll[s] in half and add to a baking tray, cut-side up

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, season with a pinch of salt and mix it all up until fully coated in the sauce

Return the pan to a medium heat, top the pulled chicken with your grated cheese and cook, covered, for 1 min further or until melted – this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken

### Step 8

Fill the warmed bread roll with the lettuce leaves, Mexican-style pulled chicken and zingy mayo – this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken burger

Serve the Mexican-style pulled chicken burger with the paprika fries, shredded lettuce and diced tomato to the side

Drizzle any remaining zingy mayo over the lettuce and tomato

Enjoy!
