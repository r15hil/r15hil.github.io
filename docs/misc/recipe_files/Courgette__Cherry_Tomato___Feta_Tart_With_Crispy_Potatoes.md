## Ingredients

- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Courgette
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3
- Feta (30g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top and tail your courgette[s], then peel lengths from 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> courgette until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Grate the remaining courgette

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the grated courgette and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until any liquid has evaporated

Once done, add your crème fraîche to the pan and stir to combine – this is your creamy courgette sauce


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper, then add the pastry squares to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!


### Step 5

Spread the creamy courgette sauce over the pastry squares (keep it within the borders!)

Top the creamy sauce with the courgette ribbons and halved cherry tomatoes

Crumble over your feta

Season with a generous grind of pepper


### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – these are your courgette, cherry tomato & feta tarts


### Step 7

Whilst everything is cooking, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Dress the salad with the balsamic dressing

Serve the courgette, cherry tomato & feta tarts with the dressed salad and crispy potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
