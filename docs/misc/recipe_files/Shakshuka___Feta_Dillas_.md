## Description

Although this rich, spicy tomato and egg dish is said to have its origins in North Africa, it's now just as well known for its popularity as a breakfast option across Israel. The crispy 'feta-dillas' with gooey centres make excellent soldiers. Verdict: a quick, wholesome dish that delivers bundles of flavour!

Crack an egg into each groove and season with salt and pepper


Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-5 <span class="text-highlight">min</span> or until the eggs are cooked&nbsp;to your liking &ndash; this is your Shakshuka


Tip: if you like your eggs runny, cook for 1-2 min and then turn the heat off but leave the lid on until ready to serve&nbsp;

### Step 8

Slice the crispy feta-dillas into triangles


Sprinkle the remaining parsley over the Shakshuka


Place&nbsp;the pan&nbsp;and feta-dillas in the middle of the table and dig in!


Enjoy!
