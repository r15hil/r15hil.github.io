## Description

Glamorgan ‘sausages’ are little Welsh vegetarian sausages that hark back to the 17th Century. Originally they were made from local leeks and Glamorgan cheese. We’ve opted for tangy cheddar and turned our bangers into patties for a modern twist.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 15 min

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 2

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and finely chop

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the chopped leek and 30ml <span class="text-danger">[60ml] </span>cold water, then cook for 3 min or until the water has evaporated

Once evaporated, transfer the cooked leek onto a plate and leave to cool completely (reserve the pan for later!)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, separate the egg yolk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the white<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> by cracking the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> over a shallow bowl and catching the yolk in the shell

Transfer the yolk from one shell half to the other several times, until all the whites are in the bowl and you are left with the yolk in the shell, then transfer the yolk to a separate shallow bowl

Grate the cheddar cheese

### Step 4

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges, then peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into wedges

After the potatoes have had their initial 15 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and move the potatoes to one side

Add the tomato wedges and onion wedges and return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a further 15-20 min or until the potatoes have browned and crisped

### Step 5

Combine half of the panko breadcrumbs with the grated cheese, cooled leek, egg yolk and half of the wholegrain mustard (save the rest for later!) – this is your patty mixture

Season with salt and pepper, then divide the mixture in 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into patties

Gently coat the patties in the egg white and press them into the remaining panko breadcrumbs – these are your Glamorgan-style patties

### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the Glamorgan-style patties and cook for 4-5 min on each side until browned and crispy, adding more vegetable oil if needed

Tip: Resist fiddling with the patties so they hold their shape!

### Step 7

While the patties are cooking, combine the mayo with the remaining wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl – this is your wholegrain mayo

Wash the baby leaf salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then combine with the roasted tomato & onion – this is your salad

### Step 8

Dress the salad with a drizzle of olive oil

Serve the Glamorgan-style patties with the potato wedges, dressed salad and wholegrain mayo to the side

Enjoy!
