## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your black olives roughly

Chop your capers roughly


### Step 2

Heat a large pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 375ml <span class="text-purple">[500ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced garlic and dried basil to the pot with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped olives and capers

Cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and your chopped tomatoes to the pot with your tortiglioni and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through and the sauce has thickened


### Step 6

Whilst the tortiglioni is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the tortiglioni is cooked, stir through the spinach with a generous grind of black pepper, a pinch of sugar and a splash of boiled water

Cook for a further 1 min or until the spinach has wilted – this is your one-pot plant-based tortiglioni puttanesca

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot plant-based tortiglioni puttanesca in a bowl

Season with a grind of black pepper and garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
