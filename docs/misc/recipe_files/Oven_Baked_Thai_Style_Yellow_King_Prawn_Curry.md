## Description

Prepping this spicy curry couldn't be easier. You'll throw everything but the prawns in a pot, then leave it in the oven. Once that's done, add succulent prawns and serve with fragrant baked rice to the side. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's gets started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Peel and chop your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped pepper, shallot wedges and chopped sweet potato to the dish with your ginger & garlic paste

### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your curry powder to the dish with your cornflour, ground coriander, ground turmeric and fish sauce

Add the chopped creamed coconut and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

### Step 5

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water to the dish and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until the sweet potato is tender

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1642003326603-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the drained rice to an oven-proof dish with the bay leaf[ves] and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your fragrant rice

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is tender, remove the dish from the oven, then drain your king prawns and add them to the dish

Give everything a good mix up, cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your oven baked Thai-style yellow king prawn curry

### Step 8

Serve the oven baked Thai-style yellow king prawn curry with the fragrant rice to the side (discard the bay leaf!)
