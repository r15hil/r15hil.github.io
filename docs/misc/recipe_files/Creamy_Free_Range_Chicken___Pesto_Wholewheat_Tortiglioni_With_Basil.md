Add your wholewheat tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and reserve about 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> starchy cooking water
