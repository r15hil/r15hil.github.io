Once the pepper has softened, add the chopped garlic with your ginger paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg

Once scrambled, add the drained rice noodles and pad Thai sauce to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken pad Thai noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the chicken pad Thai noodles topped with the chopped peanuts, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
