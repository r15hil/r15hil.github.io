### Step 2

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to the pot with the spring onion and 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Meanwhile, cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice finely

Peel and finely slice your garlic

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Boil a kettle

### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince, ground cumin and cumin seeds to the pan and cook for 4 min or until starting to crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool 

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

Roughly chop your coriander, reserving some leaves for garnish

### Step 6

Add the onion wedges to the pan and cook for 3 min or until they're beginning to soften

Add the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the garlic is lightly browned

### Step 7

Once the garlic is lightly browned, add your Chinese rice wine, soy sauce and honey to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!), then season with salt and pepper – this is your fragrant lamb

Meanwhile, add the chopped coriander and spinach to the cooked rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your green rice

### Step 8

Serve the green rice alongside the fragrant lamb and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
