### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tomato & mozzarella tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

While the pasta is cooking, slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 5

Once the bacon lardons have started to brown, add the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced garlic, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock

### Step 6

Add tomato stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your Amatriciana sauce

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 7

Add the drained tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your tomato & bacon Amatriciana sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

### Step 8

Serve the tomato & bacon Amatriciana sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
