### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds, then bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Combine the smashed cucumber, half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), your toasted sesame seeds and a small drizzle of olive oil – this is your sesame smashed cucumber

### Step 3

Divide your sausage meat into 1 piece per person (remove the paper if required!), shape into a thick patty[ies] and transfer to a floured chopping board

Sprinkle over a handful of flour and cover the thick patty[ies] with a sheet of baking paper

Roll out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your smashed patty[ies]

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the smashed patty[ies]

Press down very firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on on each side, pressing down continuously, until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smashed sausage patty[ies]

### Step 5

Transfer the smashed sausage patty[ies] to a plate to rest and reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 6

While your egg is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1723568752074-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Melt a generous knob of butter in a pot over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your mayo, remaining rice vinegar, gochujang paste and sriracha

Whisk until you have a thick sauce then season with pepper – this is your gochujang hollandaise

### Step 8

Top a toasted ciabatta base with a few slices of tomato, a smashed sausage patty, a fried egg, a dollop of gochujang hollandaise and a ciabatta lid – this is your smashed sausage, fried egg & gochujang hollandaise sarnie

Serve the chips, sesame smashed cucumber and remaining gochujang hollandaise to the side

Enjoy!
