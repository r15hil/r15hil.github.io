## Ingredients

- Proper Porker sausages (3pcs) x0
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Proper Porker sausages (6pcs)
- White potato x4
- Carrot x2
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] at an angle

Add the sliced carrot[s] to a baking tray, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season them with a pinch of pepper

Add your sausages to the tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!) and put everything in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through


### Step 2

While the carrot and sausages are cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Tip: If you'd rather skin-off mash, peel the potatoes first

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

Reboil a kettle

Dissolve your beef stock mix and onion marmalade in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and mix until fully combined – this is your onion gravy stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has caramelised, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring until the onion is evenly coated in the flour

Add your onion gravy stock, increase the heat to medium and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your red onion gravy


### Step 6

While the gravy thickens, trim your green beans, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving

Tip: For a speedy alternative, add your green beans to a small bowl with a splash of cold water and microwave, covered, for 1-2 min


### Step 7

While the green beans are boiling, return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Season with a pinch of pepper and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Serve the sausages over the mash with the carrot and green beans to the side

Pour the red onion gravy all over and enjoy!
