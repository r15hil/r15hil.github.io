## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, heat a pot with a lid with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> [1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce, half your ginger paste (save the rest for later!), mango chutney and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water, then give everything a good mix up

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick curry-like consistency, then cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu sauce


### Step 4

Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) then cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Combine the diced shallot with the mayo in a small bowl along with a squeeze of lime juice and give everything a good mix up – this is your lime tartare sauce


### Step 5

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop into strips

Add the tofu strips and remaining ginger paste to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water, 1/4 of your cornflour (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated tofu

Add the remaining cornflour to a large bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and the remaining curry powder – these are your curried breadcrumbs


### Step 6

Add the marinated tofu to the bowl with the curried breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up so the tofu pieces are fully coated – this is your coated tofu

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> [6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned – these are your katsu tofish fingers


### Step 7

While the tofu is cooking, put your ciabattas in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty, then carefully slice in half

Wash then remove leaves (2 per person!) from your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and set aside 

Chop the inner core into quarters, lengthways

### Step 8

Fill your ciabatta with the lime tartare sauce, whole lettuce leaves, katsu tofish fingers, katsu sauce and half of your crispy onions

Serve the quartered lettuce to the side and dress with a squeeze of lime juice and remaining crispy onions

Serve the chips to the side and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
