## Ingredients

- Dried cranberries (30g)
- Whole butternut squash
-  'Nduja (40g)
- Pistachios (25g)
- Ciabatta
- Soft goats' cheese (75g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)

- White wine vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel your butternut squash[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cut in half using a sharp knife

Tip: Be careful! Drizzle the knife with a little vegetable oil for easier chopping

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard


### Step 2

Cut narrow slices (approx. 1cm apart) into the butternut squash halves, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – this is your hasselback butternut squash

Transfer the hasselback butternut squash to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper then cover tightly with tin foil

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 40 min or until the butternut squash is soft


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar and half your honey (save the rest for later!) in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your honey dressing

Chop your pistachios and your dried cranberries finely

Combine the chopped pistachios and cranberries – this is your jewel mix


### Step 4

Break your goats' cheese into rough pieces

Roll the goats' cheese pieces in the jewel mix until fully coated, then set aside for later – this is your pistachio & cranberry jewelled goats' cheese

Reserve any remaining jewel mix for a garnish later


### Step 5

Dice your ‘nduja finely

Tear your ciabatta[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the torn ciabatta to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 6-8 min or until golden and crisp – these are your croutons


### Step 6

Once the butternut squash is softened, remove the tray from the oven and top with the chopped ‘nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining honey

Return the tray to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 8-10 min further or until the 'nduja is cooked and slightly charred – this is your 'nduja butternut squash


### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the honey dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the ‘nduja butternut squash with the dressed salad and top with the pistachio & cranberry jewelled goats' cheese and croutons

Garnish with the remaining jewel mix

Enjoy!
