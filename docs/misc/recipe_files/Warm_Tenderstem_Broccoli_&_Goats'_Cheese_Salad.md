### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, and boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your butternut squash cubes to a large baking tray with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 5 min

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your hazelnuts to a separate baking tray and put them in the oven for 4-5 min or until they've toasted and darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, set the toasted hazelnuts aside to cool before chopping finely

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar, honey, chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), a very generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in small bowl – this is your honey dressing

### Step 7

Roll your goats' cheese in the chopped toasted hazelnuts – this is your nutty goats' cheese

Add the cooked bulgur and honey dressing to the tray[s] with the roast vegetables and give everything a good mix up – this is your bulgur salad

### Step 8

Serve the nutty goats' cheese over the bulgur salad

Enjoy!
