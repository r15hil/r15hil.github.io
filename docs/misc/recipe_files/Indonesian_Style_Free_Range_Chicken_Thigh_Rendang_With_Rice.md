## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a full kettle

Trim, then cut your green beans in half

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then roughly chop the softer inner core[s]


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and the tough outer lemongrass layers to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the chopped green beans

Cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice


### Step 3

While the rice and beans are cooking, peel and quarter your shallot

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green skins


### Step 4

Add your cardamom seeds, soft innner core of the lemongrass and chopped shallot to a food processor with your crushed garlic and ginger paste

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your ground cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Only add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 ½ tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and blitz until smooth – this is your rendang paste


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min on one side or until lightly browned

Once browned, flip the thighs and add the rendang paste and your lime leaves and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the thighs are evenly browned and the paste is fragrant


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water with your chicken stock mix and fish sauce– this is your coconut stock


### Step 7

Once the chicken thighs are browned, add the coconut stock and cook covered for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce is thickened – this is your Indonesian-style chicken thigh rendang

### Step 8

Fluff the green bean rice with a fork

Serve the Indonesian-style chicken thigh rendang over the green bean rice and garnish with your remaining chilli flakes

Enjoy!
