### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways, then slice

Add the sliced parsnip to a heatproof bowl

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min or until fork-tender

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the chopped leek and cook for 3 min or until softened
