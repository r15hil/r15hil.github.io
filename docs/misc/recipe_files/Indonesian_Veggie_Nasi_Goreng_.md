### Step 6

Add the&nbsp;cooked rice to the pan and cook for 2 min&nbsp;

Tip: give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

### Step 8

Serve the fried eggs over the vegetable fried&nbsp;rice&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;chilli dressing drizzled over


Garnish with the chopped&nbsp;roasted peanuts and reserved coriander leaves
