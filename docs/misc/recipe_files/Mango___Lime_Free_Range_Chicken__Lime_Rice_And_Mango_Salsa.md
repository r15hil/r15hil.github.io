## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 1 mango
- 1 red chilli
- 20g mango chutney 
- 0 white long grain rice
- 1 tomato
- 320g British free range skinless chicken thighs
- 130g white long grain rice
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 5g coriander
- 1 spring onion
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail and peel your mango[es], then stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s] (if you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone)

Dice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone[s]

Zest half your lime[s] and cut in half


### Step 2

Add your mango chutney to a large bowl with the ground turmeric, the juice of half the lime, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your mango & lime marinade

Add the free range chicken thighs to the bowl with the marinade, mix it all together until fully coated and set aside for later – these are your marinated chicken thighs


### Step 3

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Add the marinated chicken thighs to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] under the grill for 15-20 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and nicely charred – this is your mango & lime chicken


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Dice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely


### Step 6

Add the diced mango to a bowl with half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for later!), the chopped coriander, diced tomato and most of the sliced red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Drizzle with a little olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your mango salsa

Combine the mayo with a small squeeze of lime juice and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the lime zest and remaining sliced spring onion to the pot

Stir it all together and keep covered until ready to serve – this is your lime rice

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the mango & lime free range chicken with the lime rice, mango salsa and lime mayo to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge and the remaining sliced red chilli

Enjoy!
