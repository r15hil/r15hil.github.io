## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Top, tail and peel half your carrot[s] into a pile of ribbons

Top, tail and grate the remaining carrot

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and chop your shallot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly


### Step 3

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate and season with salt and pepper, then add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate


### Step 4

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Coat the basa fillet in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated carrot, chopped ginger and chopped shallot and cook for 3 min

Add your curry powder and cook for a further 2 min

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the vegetables evenly


### Step 6

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to low, then add your soy sauce and stir through your mango chutney and cook for 5-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Season with a generous pinch of salt, cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu sauce

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat


### Step 7

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 5-6 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Combine your rice vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Add your shredded lettuce and the carrot ribbons to the bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your salad

### Step 8

Spoon the katsu sauce onto the plate and serve the breaded basa over the sauce with the cooked rice and salad to the side

Enjoy!
