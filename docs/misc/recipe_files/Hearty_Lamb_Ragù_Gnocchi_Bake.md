## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- British lamb mince (250g)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Gnocchi (350g)
- Dried bay leaf
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and bay leaf[ves] and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Once softened, add your lamb mince and cook for 5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once the lamb mince has browned, add your dried oregano, chopped tomatoes and beef stock to the pan

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until the stock has thickened to a ragù-like consistency and lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lamb ragù


### Step 5

Whilst the ragù is thickening, add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the cooked gnocchi


### Step 6

Once the ragù has thickened, wash your spinach, then add it to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min further, stirring continuously until the spinach has wilted

Add the cooked gnocchi, season with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up

Remove the bay leaf[ves] and discard – this is your hearty lamb gnocchi ragù


### Step 7

Transfer the hearty lamb gnocchi ragù to an oven-proof dish

Sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your hearty lamb gnocchi ragù bake

### Step 8

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the hearty lamb ragù gnocchi bake

Enjoy!
