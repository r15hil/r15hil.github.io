## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 6 Proper Porker sausages
- 15ml Henderson's Relish 
- 21g wholegrain mustard 
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 20g onion marmalade
- 15ml white wine vinegar 
- 300g waxy potatoes
- 1 spring onion
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the sausages to a tin foil-lined baking tray 

Put them in the oven for 20-25 min or until they are browned


### Step 2

While the sausages are in the oven, peel and finely slice the red onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt

Cook for 5 min, or until the onion has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the waxy potatoes into quarters

Add them to a pot, cover with plenty of cold water and a pinch of salt

Bring to a boil over a high heat and cook for 20 min or until fork-tender


### Step 4

Once the red onion has softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, the onion marmalade, red wine vinegar, Henderson's Relish and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water to the pan

Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cook the onions for a further 20 min, or until they're sticky and sweet – these are your caramelised onions


### Step 5

While the onions are caramelising, combine the mayo, wholegrain mustard and white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl – this is your dressing


### Step 6

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 7

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and combine with the baby leaf salad, sliced spring onion and most of the dressing (save some for garnish!) in a bowl, then mix gently – this is your warm potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the warm potato salad topped with the cooked sausages and caramelised onions

Drizzle over the reserved dressing

Enjoy!
