## Ingredients

- British rump pavé steak (300g)
- British rump pavé steak (150g) x0
- Crème fraîche (80g)
- Cracked black pepper (2.5g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Shallot
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips


### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil half a kettle (you'll only need a little!)

Trim your green beans


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the trimmed green beans with the chopped garlic, then cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic is fragrant

Season with a pinch of salt and add a splash of boiled water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the beans are tender

Once done, keep covered and set aside for later – these are your garlicky green beans


### Step 5

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, rub with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt

Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, then once very hot, add the seasoned steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side


### Step 6

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest, then return the pan to a low heat

Add the diced shallot to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until softened


### Step 7

Add your soy sauce and crème fraîche and cook for 30 secs, stirring frequently

Tip: Scrape any bits from the bottom of the pan as this will add extra flavour to the sauce!

Add your cracked black pepper and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy peppercorn sauce

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Pour any resting juices from the steak into the peppercorn sauce

Serve the rump steak over the creamy peppercorn sauce with the chips and garlicky green beans to the side

Enjoy!
