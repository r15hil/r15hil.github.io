### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Crush your garlic clove[s] open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin[s]

Once the dish is hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water with your Dijon mustard and chicken stock mix

### Step 5

Once boiling, add your dried thyme

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 40 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables are tender

### Step 6

While the chicken is in the oven, add your potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) and prick them a few times with a sharp knife

Add a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 40 min or until cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

After 40 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your crème fraîche with a generous pinch of pepper – this is your creamy free range chicken & mushroom stew

Remove the potatoes from the oven and crush them firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a plate

Add a knob of butter and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – these are your crushed potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the creamy free range chicken & mushroom stew with the crushed potatoes to the side
