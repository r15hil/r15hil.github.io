### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and ground turmeric and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your basmati rice to the pan with your saffron, chicken stock mix and a knob of butter and give everything a good mix up

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, top the rice with your sultanas, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 4

Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the diced chicken thigh and remaining chopped garlic in a bowl with your ground paprika, ground sumac and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced chicken

### Step 5

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, add your spinach and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted – this is your sumac chicken

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1680105475443-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the rice has cooked, increase the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a final 3-4 min or until the rice is slightly crispy on the base of the pan – this is your Persian-style tahdig

Tip: don't worry if some has stuck, just scrape it out, the crispy bits are the best bit!

### Step 7

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

### Step 8

Serve the Persian-style tahdig with the sumac chicken on top

Garnish with the chopped mint and drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Enjoy!
