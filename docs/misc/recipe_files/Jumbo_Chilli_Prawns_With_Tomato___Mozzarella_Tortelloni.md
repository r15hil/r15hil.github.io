## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tomato & mozzarella tortelloni


### Step 6

Once the tomatoes have softened, drain your jumbo prawns

Add the drained jumbo prawns, sliced garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Once the prawns are cooked, add your Chinese rice wine, salad, drained tomato & mozzarella tortelloni and half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan

Give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your chilli, garlic & tomato jumbo prawns with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

### Step 8

Serve the chilli & tomato jumbo prawns with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni topped with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
