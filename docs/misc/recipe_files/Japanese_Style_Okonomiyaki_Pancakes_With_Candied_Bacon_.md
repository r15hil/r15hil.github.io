Combine your egg[s] with 70g <span class="text-purple">[100g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130g] </span>flour and the chicken stock in a medium bowl – this is your pancake batter

Put the pancake batter in the fridge to rest


### Step 2

Add your smoked streaky bacon to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12 min or until golden and crispy

Squeeze the juice of the grated ginger into a small bowl


### Step 4

Give everything a good mix up – this is your okonomiyaki pancake mix


### Step 5

Once hot, add the okonomiyaki pancake mix to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (use a wide spatula to carefully flip the pancake over) – this is your Japanese-style okonomiyaki pancake

Combine half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) with your tomato ketchup, Henderson's Relish and a small pinch of salt – this is your cheats okonomiyaki sauce


### Step 7

Once the bacon has had an initial 12 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle the remaining honey over the top

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3 min or until crispy and caramelised – this is your candied bacon

Add the shredded spring onion and reserved carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the ginger juice with a drizzle of olive oil and toss until fully coated in dressing – this is your gingery slaw

Cut the Japanese-style okonomiyaki pancake[s] into 3 slices per person

### Step 8

Serve the Japanese-style okonomiyaki pancake slices stacked, then top with the candied bacon and the gingery slaw to the side

Drizzle your mayo and cheats okonomiyaki sauce all over

Sprinkle over the shimichi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
