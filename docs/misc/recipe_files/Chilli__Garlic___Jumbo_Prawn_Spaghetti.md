## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for just 2 min or until cooked with a slight bite (it will keep cooking in the sauce later!)

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan with the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 3 min


### Step 5

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs further


### Step 6

Add your Chinese rice wine with a pinch of sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the prawns are cooked through

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 7

Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with a splash of the starchy pasta water

Cook for 1 min further, stirring until the sauce thickens – this is your chilli, garlic & jumbo prawn spaghetti

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chilli, garlic & jumbo prawn spaghetti

Top with a handful of salad, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of pepper

Dig in!
