## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Peel your garlic and roughly tear your basil, including the stalks (reserve a couple of leaves for garnish!)

Add the peeled garlic, torn basil and a large knob of butter to a food processor and pulse until blitzed but not smooth – this is your basil butter


### Step 2

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[650ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 3

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 4

Add your orzo, vegetable stock and half of the basil butter (you'll use the rest later!) to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and gently stir it all together


### Step 5

Place the halved cherry tomatoes evenly on top of the orzo, they should sink down under the stock

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper


### Step 6

Put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until the stock has been absorbed and the orzo is cooked – this is your tomato & green butter orzo


### Step 7

Once the orzo is almost cooked, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining basil butter to the pan and cook for 1 min

Drain, then add your king prawns and red wine vinegar and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your garlicky king prawns

### Step 8

Serve the garlicky king prawns over the tomato & green butter orzo

Scatter over the reserved basil leaves and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
