### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, peel your brown onion[s] and chop roughly

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop your ginger

Peel and chop your garlic

Separate your coriander leaves from their stalks

### Step 3

Add the chopped onion, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), curry powder and coriander stalks (reserve the leaves for garnish!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your Sri Lankan-style curry paste

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

Boil a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then dissolve in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> </span><span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Add your red wine vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock and cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for 8-12 min or until a thick sauce remains

### Step 6

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Once the sauce has thickened, top the curry with the haddock bites and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Serve the aromatic Sri Lankan-style haddock curry over the basmati rice

Top the rice with your crispy onions and garnish with chopped coriander leaves

Enjoy!
