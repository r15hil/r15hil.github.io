- Wholegrain mustard (21g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs, then add to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and mix together

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your smoky potatoes


### Step 2

Grate most of your radishes

Cut the remaining radishes into quarters

Slice half your cucumber into rounds

Cut the remaining cucumber into batons lengthways


### Step 3

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Add the grated radishes to a bowl with your mayo, wholegrain mustard, diced shallot, Henderson's Relish and a grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy slaw


### Step 4

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Add the radish quarters and cucumber rounds to a small bowl with the cucumber slices

Add your white wine vinegar, chopped dill, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar, then give everything a good mix up – these are your dill, cucumber & radish pickles and quick-pickled cucumber rounds


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides


### Step 6

Once very hot, add the steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a clean chopping board to rest for 5 min


### Step 7

Add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Carefully slice in half before serving

Once rested, slice the cooked steak as thinly as you can on a clean board

### Step 8

Stuff your hot ciabatta with the sliced steak, pickled radish slaw and the quick-pickled cucumber rounds

Serve with the smoky potatoes and the dill, cucumber & radish pickles to the side

Enjoy!
