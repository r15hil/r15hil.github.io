### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife, then remove the skins and chop roughly

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the onion wedges and chopped garlic to the dish with your cherry tomatoes

Add your tomato paste, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix with your dried oregano, black olives and 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a pinch of salt, half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and stir through your farfalle

### Step 5

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 25-30 min, stirring halfway through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 6

When the pasta is almost ready, boil a kettle

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Crumble your Greek cheese into small bite-sized pieces

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1689589729249-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After an initial 25-30 min, stir the spinach and most of the crumbled Greek cheese (save the rest for garnish!) through the pasta then return to the oven, covered, for a final 5 min – this is your Greek cheese, olive & cherry tomato farfalle

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a large bowl with the remaining red wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Toss to combine – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

To serve, set the Greek cheese, olive & cherry tomato farfalle in the centre of the table with the dressed salad to the side

Top the pasta with the remaining crumbled Greek cheese and season with a pinch of pepper

Dig in!
