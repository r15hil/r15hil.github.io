### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice the brown onions

Heat a pot over a low heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the sliced onions, dried thyme, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 20-25 min, stirring frequently, or until the onions have halved in size and caramelised – these are your caramelised onions

### Step 2

While the onions are caramelising, slice the potatoes (skins on) into thin discs, then slice each potato disc into matchsticks

Add the potato matchsticks to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your matchstick fries

### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Combine the beef mince in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> and shape into equal-sized patties and refrigerate until later

### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

### Step 5

Once caramelised, reserve half the caramelised onions in a bowl and set aside (you'll use the rest later!)

Return the remaining caramelised onions in the pot to the heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 1 min

Add the beef stock mix and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has begun to thicken to a gravy-like consistency – this is your onion gravy

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1675768001027-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the beef patties, press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 4-5 min on one side or until browned

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Wash the rocket then pat dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1675768006777-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once browned, flip the beef patties and top with the reserved caramelised onions and grated cheese

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the cheese has melted and the patties are cooked through – these are your cheesy patties

Combine the Dijon mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your Dijon mustard mayo

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread the Dijon mustard mayo over each toasted bun base,  then top with a handful of rocket, a cheesy patty, a drizzle of onion gravy and a toasted lid

Serve with the remaining onion gravy, matchstick fries and remaining rocket to the side

Drizzle the white wine vinegar and a little olive oil over the rocket

Enjoy!
