## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste with your diced chicken breast and cook for 6 min or until the chicken starts to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce, red chilli relish and toasted sesame oil in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli & sesame sauce


### Step 4

Once the chicken starts to brown, add your udon noodles to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and cook, covered, for an initial 2 min

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!


### Step 5

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan with the noodles and cook, covered, for a further 2 min until the spinach has started to wilt


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely


### Step 7

Once the spinach has wilted, add the sweet chilli & sesame sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are coated and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet chilli & sesame chicken udon

### Step 8

Serve the sweet chilli & sesame chicken udon in a bowl

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion and your crispy onions

Enjoy!
