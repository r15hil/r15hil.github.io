- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 32g tomato paste
- 30ml vegan mayonnaise
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 plant based brioche buns
- 20g chipotle paste
- 3 white potatoes
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Peel and dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

Once the onion has started to caramelise, add the meat-free mince, smoked paprika and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan

Cook for 5-6 min further until the mince is starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Whilst the mince is cooking, dissolve the tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the mince has browned, increase the heat to high, add the tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened – this is your BBQ meat-free mince


### Step 6

Slice the brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted


### Step 7

Add the mayo and white wine vinegar to the drained potatoes with a pinch of salt and pepper

Gently mix it all together – this is your creamy potato salad

Wash the baby leaf salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Fill the toasted brioche buns with the BBQ meat-free mince – these are your meat-free mince sloppy joes

Serve the creamy potato salad and baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle some olive oil over the baby leaf salad

Enjoy!
