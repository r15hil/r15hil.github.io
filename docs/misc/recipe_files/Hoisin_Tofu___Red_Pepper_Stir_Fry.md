## Ingredients

- Red pepper
- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- White long grain rice (130g)
- White long grain rice (65g) x0
- Plain tofu (280g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tofu and cornflour to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is completely coated


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan (reserve the bowl and any remaining cornflour!)

Cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy all over, turning occasionally, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and reserve the pan – this is your crispy tofu


### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and onion petals and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 6

While the veg is softening, combine your hoisin sauce and soy sauce in the reserved bowl with your ginger & garlic paste, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your hoisin sauce


### Step 7

Once the veg has softened, add your hoisin sauce and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly

Once thickened, add the crispy tofu to the pan – this is your hoisin tofu & red pepper stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin tofu & red pepper stir-fry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
