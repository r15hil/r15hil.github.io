### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle, then chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half (chop them in one bunch for speed!)

Add your quick cook spaghetti and Tenderstem to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook for just 2 min (it will keep cooking in the sauce later!)

Once done, drain the spaghetti & Tenderstem, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Add your soft cheese and give everything a good mix up

### Step 7

Add the halved cherry tomatoes, drained spaghetti & Tenderstem and a splash of the starchy pasta water

Add a grind of black pepper and cook for 1 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your chorizo, tomato & Tenderstem spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo, tomato & Tenderstem spaghetti topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
