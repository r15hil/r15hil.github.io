## Ingredients

- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Spring onion
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Mayonnaise (50ml)
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Mayonnaise (30ml) x0
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Parsley (5g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half


### Step 2

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 12-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, trim your green beans then chop in half

Zest your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Cut the lemon[s] in half

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Combine the juice of half the lemon with your mayo and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your lemon dressing


### Step 5

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10-15 min, add the halved green beans and cook for a further 4-6 min or until everything is tender

Once tender, drain and leave in the colander to steam dry


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked basa fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Add the drained potatoes, green beans, sliced spring onion and chopped parsley to the lemon dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your warm green bean & potato salad

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the cooked smoked basa over the warm green bean & potato salad with a lemon wedge to the side

Season the fish with a grind of black pepper and sprinkle over the lemon zest

Enjoy!
