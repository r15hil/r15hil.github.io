### Step 5

Once everything's been cooking for 25-30 min, boil a kettle

Cut your tomato[es] in half

Add the tomato halves, cut-side up, to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt

Drizzle over half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – these are your roasted balsamic tomatoes
