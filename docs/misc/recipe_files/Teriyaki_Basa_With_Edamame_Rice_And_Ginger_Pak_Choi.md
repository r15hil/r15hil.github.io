Once hot, add the teriyaki sauce mix to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until a sticky sauce has formed – this is your teriyaki sauce

Tip: Stir the sauce as it cooks to stop it from burning!

### Step 8

Serve the basa with the ginger pak choi and edamame rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Spoon the teriyaki sauce all over

Enjoy!
