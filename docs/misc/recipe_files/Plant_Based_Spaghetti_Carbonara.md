## Ingredients

- Creamy single soy (200ml)
- Tomato
- White miso paste (17g)
- Spaghetti (190g)
- Meat-free bacon lardons (60g)
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Rocket (50g)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the  for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 3

While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free bacon lardons and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy all over


### Step 4

Once done, transfer the crispy meat-free bacon to a bowl and return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine half of your cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your dressing

Dice your tomato[es]


### Step 6

Once the garlic is fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your creamy single soy, miso paste and remaining cider vinegar

Tip: The miso paste adds an umami flavour to the sauce!

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened to a creamy consistency


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked spaghetti and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce – this is your plant-based spaghetti carbonara

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is a little thick!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based spaghetti carbonara and top with the crispy meat-free bacon and a grind of black pepper

Toss the salad and diced tomato, then serve to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!
