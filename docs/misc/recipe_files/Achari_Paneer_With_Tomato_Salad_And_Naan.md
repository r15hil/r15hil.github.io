## Ingredients

- Paneer (200g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Ground turmeric (0.5tsp)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Plain naan (2pcs)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Coriander (5g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Tomato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Chop your paneer into large, bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the paneer cubes and cook for 3-4 min or until golden all over, then set aside on a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice 1/4 of your red onion[s] and set aside for later

Peel and finely dice the remaining red onion

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away and chop the deseeded cucumber into half moons


### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and ginger to the pan with your ground turmeric, ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste to the pan with vegetable stock and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened slightly

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your naan[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through


### Step 6

Chop your tomato[es] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Combine the chopped tomato, cucumber half moons, sliced red onion and a pinch of chopped coriander in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato salad


### Step 7

Return the golden paneer to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add your natural yoghurt and cook for a further 2-3 min or until everything's warmed through

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through the remaining chopped coriander – this is your achari paneer

### Step 8

Serve the achari paneer over the warmed naan with the tomato salad to the side

Enjoy!
