### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your slow cooker and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Turn on your slow cooker to high

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over high heat

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the chopped aubergine and onion wedges to the pan


### Step 4

Chop your flat white mushrooms into bite-sized chunks

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly
