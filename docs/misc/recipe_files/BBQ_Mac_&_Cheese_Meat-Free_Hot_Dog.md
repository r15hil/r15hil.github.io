### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add your meat-free hot dog sausage[s] to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 2

While the sausage[s] is cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s] as thinly as you can

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 7 min or until it's cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the macaroni, reserving the pot

### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs, chopped garlic and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently – these are your garlic breadcrumbs

### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk into the roux with your soft cheese and whisk for 3-4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked macaroni and grated cheese to the pot with a generous grind of pepper and a small pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up until fully coated and the cheese has melted – this is your macaroni cheese

Once the sausage[s] has had an initial 20 min, add your hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the baking tray and cook for 3 min or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

### Step 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce, tomato wedges and quick-pickled shallot to a bowl with a small drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato & shallot salad

Cut a slit into the top of the warmed hot dog bun[s]

### Step 8

To build, fill each warmed hot dog bun with a meat-free hot dog sausage, then top with some of the macaroni cheese, your BBQ sauce and some of the garlic breadcrumbs – this is your BBQ mac & cheese meat-free hot dog

Serve the remaining macaroni cheese topped with the remaining garlic breadcrumbs and the tomato & shallot salad to the side

Enjoy!
