### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot ciabatta once it's out of the toaster

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Drain your sweetcorn

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

### Step 4

Once the pan is hot, add the sliced spring onion, bay leaf[ves] and drained sweetcorn with a pinch of black pepper

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, turn the heat up to high

Add your vegetable stock mix with your soft cheese, Chinese rice wine and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> milk, stirring to dissolve

Add your smoked basa fillet[s], and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Once the basa is cooked, break it into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon – this is your smoked basa & corn chowder

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your dill and chives together roughly, including the stalks

Add half of the chopped dill & chives (you'll use the rest for garnish!) to the smoked basa & corn chowder

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa & corn chowder with the crusty ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped dill & chives

Enjoy!
