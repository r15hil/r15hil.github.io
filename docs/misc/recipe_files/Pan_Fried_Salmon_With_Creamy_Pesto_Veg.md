## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 50g soft cheese 
- 45g traditional Italian pesto
- 2 x 110g skin on salmon fillets
- 160g blanched peas
- 1 broccoli

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat

Once hot, add the salmon fillets (skin-side down), season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your pan-fried salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 2

Whilst the salmon is cooking, chop the broccoli into florets

Cut the broccoli stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add the broccoli florets and chopped broccoli stalk to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for an initial 4-5 min


### Step 4

After an initial 4-5 min, add the blanched peas to the pot and cook for a further 1 min or until everything is tender

Once the veg is tender, drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the soft cheese and pesto to a measuring jug with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water

Give it a good mix up until smooth – this is your creamy pesto sauce


### Step 6

Return the drained broccoli & peas to a medium-low heat and add the creamy pesto sauce with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has warmed through – this is your creamy pesto veg


### Step 7

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried salmon over the creamy pesto veg

Garnish with the chopped basil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
