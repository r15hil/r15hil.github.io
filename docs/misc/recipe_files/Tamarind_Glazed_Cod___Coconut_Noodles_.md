## Description

Cod is a delicate, mild yet firm fish that needs to be treated with respect. We've glazed it with tart and sweet tamarind paste, a concentrate made from a sour Indian fruit, that really works with the subtlety of cod. Served over a light coconut noodle broth, flavoured with fresh lime and coriander. Healthy comfort food at its finest!
