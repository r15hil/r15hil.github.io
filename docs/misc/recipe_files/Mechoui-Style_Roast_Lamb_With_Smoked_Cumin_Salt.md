### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Remove the string from your lamb leg joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rub over most of your ras el hanout (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the seasoned lamb to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly charred on all sides – this is your charred lamb

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Combine the courgette ribbons with the remaining ras el hanout, your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your courgette salad

### Step 4

Once the lamb is slightly charred, transfer the onion wedges to a baking tray and top with the charred lamb, any lamb juices from the pan and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 8-9 min for rare, 10-12 min for medium-rare and 12-14 min for medium

### Step 5

While the lamb is in the oven, boil half a kettle

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with your vegetable stock mix, your chopped dates and half your ground cumin (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water, cover and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed

### Step 6

Combine the remaining ground cumin, smoked salt and a pinch of sugar in a small bowl – this is your smoked cumin salt

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-16-1702990877463-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board to rest for 3 min before finely slicing – this is your mechoui-style roast lamb

Transfer the roast onion wedges to the couscous and give everything a good mix up – this is your fruity couscous

### Step 8

Serve the fruity couscous topped with the courgette salad and lay over the sliced mechoui-style roast lamb

Drizzle over your natural yoghurt, then dollop on the harissa (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and swirl together

Serve the smoked cumin salt to the side

Tip: Dip your lamb in the cumin salt for an authentic experience!

Enjoy!
