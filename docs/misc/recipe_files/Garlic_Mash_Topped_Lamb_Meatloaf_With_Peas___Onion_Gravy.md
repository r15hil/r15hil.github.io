## Ingredients

- British lamb mince (250g)
- Beef stock mix (11g)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g) x0
- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Brown onion
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s]

Slice the remaining onion finely


### Step 2

Add your lamb mince to a medium bowl with the diced onion, half your beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your lamb mixture

Add the lamb mixture to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and shape into a loaf[ves]

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until browned – this is your lamb meatloaf


### Step 3

While the meatloaf is cooking, chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel your garlic

Add the chopped potatoes and peeled garlic to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-9 min or until softened and caramelised

Reboil half a kettle

Return the drained potatoes & garlic to a low heat with a splash of milk, a knob of butter and a pinch of pepper and mash until smooth – this is your garlic mash


### Step 5

Top the lamb meatloaf with the garlic mash, spread it with the back of a spoon to cover the top of the meatloaf, then fluff with a fork

Return the meatloaf to the oven for a final 15 min or until the potato is golden and crispy and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your garlic mash topped lamb meatloaf


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve the remaining beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with your onion marmalade – this is your onion beef stock

Once the onion has caramelised, increase to the heat to medium and add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until the flour has dissolved

Once dissolved, whisk in the onion beef stock with a generous pinch of pepper and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your onion gravy


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas with a small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt to a large heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 2-3 min or until the peas are hot

### Step 8

Serve the garlic mash topped lamb meatloaf with the peas to the side

Drizzle the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!
