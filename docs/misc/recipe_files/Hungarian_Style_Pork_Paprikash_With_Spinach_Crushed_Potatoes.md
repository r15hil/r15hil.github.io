### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Pat the pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned steak[s] and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through

Reboil a kettle

### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

### Step 4

Once done, transfer the cooked steak to a clean chopping board and reserve the pan

Cover the steak with a clean tea towel and leave to rest while you make the sauce

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the sliced shallot and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, ground paprika and tomato paste

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix with 75ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> [150ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 30 secs or until slightly thickened, then reduce the heat to very low and add the soured cream and any resting juices from the steak

Stir it all together and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through (don't let it boil!) – this is your paprikash sauce

### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter

Stir through the wilted spinach and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Season with a generous pinch of salt and crush the potatoes lightly with a fork – these are your spinach crushed potatoes

Slice the rested steak finely

### Step 8

To serve, top the paprikash sauce with the sliced steak – this is your Hungarian-style pork paprikash

Serve the spinach crushed potatoes to the side

Season with a generous pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
