### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Boil half a kettle

Combine the cornflour with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Add the tomato ketchup, chilli jam, soy sauce, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and whisk until smooth – this is your sweet & sour sauce

### Step 6

Add the sweet & sour sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened and sticky and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed brown basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: if you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the sweet & sour chicken with the steamed brown basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!
