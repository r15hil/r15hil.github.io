### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Tear your ’Nduja into bite-sized pieces and add it to the pan (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 2-3 min, then add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs further

### Step 4

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 5

Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your lemon[s] in half

Combine the juice of half the lemon with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your lemony dressing

### Step 6

Once the rice is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain, then add your jumbo king prawns and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 7

Add a generous knob of butter to the cooked rice and season with a grind of black pepper

Add the cooked jumbo king prawns and stir it all together – this is your jumbo prawn & ’Nduja risotto

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad in half the lemony dressing (you'll use the rest later!)

### Step 8

Serve the jumbo prawn & ’Nduja risotto

Top with the dressed salad, drizzle the remaining lemony dressing all over and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
