### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your roast potatoes

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, slice your leek[s] finely into rounds, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves and pat dry with kitchen paper

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Boil a kettle

Once melted, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

While the leek softens, lightly cover a baking tray with some vegetable oil and add your smoked basa fillet[s]

Drizzle some vegetable oil over the basa and top with your panko breadcrumbs and a grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your crispy smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

Once the leeks have softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 30 secs or until a sandy paste forms

Add 200m<span class="text-purple">l [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> milk, season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened

Once thickened, stir through your Dijon mustard and set aside – these are your creamed leeks

### Step 6

Meanwhile, trim your green beans and add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and cook them for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and set aside (save the pot for the next step!)

### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Return the green beans to the pot and cook for 1 min further or until they are fully coated in the garlic – these are your garlicky green beans

### Step 8

Serve the crispy smoky basa over the creamed leeks with the roast potatoes and garlicky green beans to the side

Enjoy!
