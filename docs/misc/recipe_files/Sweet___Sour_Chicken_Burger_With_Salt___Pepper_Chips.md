### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large, bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Add the chips and chopped pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden

Add your chicken thighs to the flour mix, then press firmly into the mixture, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – this is your coated chicken

Add your tomato ketchup and soy sauce with your rice vinegar, ginger & garlic paste and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and mix it all together – this is your sweet & sour sauce

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 9-10 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the pan and set aside, reserve the pan

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

### Step 6

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Once the chips and pepper are cooked, remove half of the roasted pepper and set aside for serving

Mix the remaining roasted pepper through the chips with the spring onion strips and season with a generous grind of black pepper – these are your salt & pepper chips

### Step 7

Carefully wipe the reserved pan with some kitchen paper (it will be hot!) and return it to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sweet & sour sauce with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the crispy chicken and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is coated in the sauce – this is your sweet & sour chicken

### Step 8

Fill your warmed brioche bun with the sweet & sour chicken and reserved roasted pepper

Serve the salt & pepper chips to the side with the remaining sweet & sour sauce in a pot for dipping

Enjoy!
