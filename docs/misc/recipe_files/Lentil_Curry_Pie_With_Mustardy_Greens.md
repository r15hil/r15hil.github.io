## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and roughly chop your potato[es]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 per person

Transfer the pastry to a baking tray (or two!) lined with non-stick baking paper and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then crimp the borders with a fork

Sprinkle over your nigella seeds and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and cooked through


### Step 4

Once the onion has started to caramelise, add your beluga lentils, chopped potato, diced carrot and curry powder and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender – this is your lentil curry pie filling

Whilst everything’s cooking, wash then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 7

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter alternative over a medium heat

Once hot, add your yellow mustard seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and starting to pop

Add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite – these are your mustardy greens

### Step 8

To serve, lay the pie lid over the lentil curry pie filling – this is your lentil curry pie

Serve the lentil curry pie with the mustardy greens to the side

Enjoy!
