## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Lasagne sheets (120g)
- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Basil (10g)
- Basil (5g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Soft cheese (50g) x2
- Rocket (20g)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your lasagne sheets one at a time (this prevents them from sticking together!) to a pot of boiled water with a very generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Cook for 5-7 min stirring occasionally, until slightly tender but not soft, then drain the lasagne sheets and lay them on a clean chopping board so they don't overlap each other


### Step 2

Reboil the kettle

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool and once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can and chop it roughly

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Once softened, add your chopped tomatoes and cook for a further 3-4 min – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 5

Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and soft cheese to a bowl with the chopped spinach and half of the chopped basil (save the rest for a garnish!)

Season with salt and pepper – this is your sun-dried tomato & spinach mix

Divide the sun-dried tomato & spinach mix between the drained lasagne sheets, then roll the filled lasagne sheets up tightly like a cigar –these are your cannelloni


### Step 6

Lightly oil an oven-proof dish

Add the cannelloni to your oven-proof dish with the seams facing down, pour the tomato sauce over and top with the torn mozzarella

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown – this is your sun-dried tomato & spinach cannelloni

### Step 7

Wash and dry your salad, then add it to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Toss it all together – this is your salad

### Step 8

Serve the sun-dried tomato & spinach cannelloni with the salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
