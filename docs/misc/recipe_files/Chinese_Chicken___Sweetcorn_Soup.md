## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine 
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil 
- 1 tin of sweetcorn (150g) 
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 10g coriander
- 1 chicken stock cube 
- 2 wheat noodle nests 
- 2 tbsp cornflour
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 2 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 2 soy sauce sachets (16ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook on both sides for 3 min or until lightly browned (don't worry it won't be fully cooked yet!)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the&nbsp;garlic


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the&nbsp;ginger


Dissolve the&nbsp;chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span>&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;&ndash; this is your&nbsp;chicken stock&nbsp;


Re-boil a kettle


### Step 3

Add both the&nbsp;chopped garlic&nbsp;and chopped&nbsp;ginger&nbsp;to the pan, reduce the heat to&nbsp;medium and cook for 1 min&nbsp;


Add the&nbsp;Shaoxing wine,&nbsp;soy sauce&nbsp;and&nbsp;chicken stock, cover with a lid, and cook for 12-15 min until the chicken is cooked


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the wheat&nbsp;noodle nests&nbsp;with a pinch of salt to a&nbsp;separate pot and cover them with&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;until they're fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite


Once done, drain and return to the pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil (this stops them sticking together)


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, pick the&nbsp;coriander leaves&nbsp;from their stems


Trim, then slice the&nbsp;spring onions finely


Add the&nbsp;cornflour to a bowl and gradually stir&nbsp;in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water, then&nbsp;whisk to a smooth paste


Tip: the cornflour and water paste will help thicken your soup!


### Step 6

Once done, transfer the&nbsp;cooked&nbsp;chicken from the broth&nbsp;to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks &ndash; this technique is known as &lsquo;pulling&rsquo;


Drain the sweetcorn&nbsp;


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Keep the pan of broth over a high heat and gradually whisk the&nbsp;cornflour paste&nbsp;into the broth until it's&nbsp;silky smooth and thickened


Add the&nbsp;shredded chicken&nbsp;back&nbsp;to the broth along with the sweetcorn and cook for 2 min or until hot &ndash; this is your chicken &amp; sweetcorn soup&nbsp;

### Step 8

Divide the drained noodles among large bowls and ladle over the chicken &amp; sweetcorn soup&nbsp;


Garnish with&nbsp;the toasted sesame seeds, sliced spring onion,&nbsp;coriander leaves and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil


Enjoy!
