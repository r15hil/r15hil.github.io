### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Once the tomatoes have slightly softened, drain, then add your jumbo king prawns and sliced garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 5-6 min or until the prawns are almost cooked through

### Step 5

While the prawns are cooking, add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tomato & mozzarella tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once the prawns are almost cooked through, add your tomato paste and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add a large knob of butter, stir everything together and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1702889282201-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the drained tortelloni and half your parsley (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan  and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your jumbo prawn & tomato sauce with mozzarella tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the jumbo prawn & tomato sauce with mozzarella tortelloni topped with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
