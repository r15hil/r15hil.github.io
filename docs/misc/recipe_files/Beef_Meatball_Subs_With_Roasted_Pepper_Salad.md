## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the air fryer to 200°C and deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to the air fryer basket with a spray of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 5 min or until softened and beginning to colour, then set aside – this is your roasted pepper

### Step 2

While the pepper is cooking, add your beef mince, half your beef stock mix and half your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape them into 6 meatballs per person

### Step 3

Once the pepper is cooked, place the meatballs in the air fryer basket with a drizzle of olive oil and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: air fryer cooking times may vary

Boil half a kettle

Tip: Air fryers work best when the food is spaced out in a single layer. You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 4

While the meatballs are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a large bowl with the chopped garlic, remaining dried oregano and a pinch of sugar and pepper

Add the remaining beef stock mix with 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinara sauce

### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your ciabatta[s] in half down the middle

Cut a slit into each ciabatta half being careful not to cut all the way through (this is where your meatballs will sit) – these are your mini ciabatta buns

Grate your lighter cheese

### Step 6

Once the meatballs are browned, toss them in the marinara sauce and put 3 meatballs into each mini ciabatta bun

Top with any remaining marinara sauce and the grated lighter cheese

Put the buns into the air fryer basket for a further 1-2 min or until the cheese is completely melted – these are your air fryer meatball subs

Tip: Air fryers work best when the food is spaced out in a single layer. You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 7

While the subs are cooking, wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the salad, roasted pepper and crispy onions in a bowl with your balsamic vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pepper salad

### Step 8

Serve the air fryer meatball subs with the pepper salad to the side

Enjoy!
