## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle, then peel lengths off your courgette[s] until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter), then combine the juice of half your lime with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a small splash of<span class="text-danger"> </span>boiled water in a heatproof bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved, add your courgette ribbons and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled courgette


### Step 2

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (save them for later) and chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and roughly chop, discard the stems

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Chop your peanuts roughly


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and the tough outer lemongrass layers, bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, then once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 6-7 min or until beginning to crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once crisp, add 3/4 your sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with your chopped ginger and chopped lemongrass and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Combine 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water with your cornflour in a jug, then add your fish sauce, soy sauce and red chilli relish with the lime zest and the remaining lime juice and stir it all together – this your zesty soy sauce

Once the pork is fragrant, add the zesty soy sauce and the chopped mint and coriander with half of your chopped peanuts (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this your Vietnamese-style lemongrass pork

Tip: Watch it like a hawk to prevent the sauce from burning!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the grated carrot and the remaining sliced onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your carrot salad


### Step 7

Remove the lemongrass outer layers from the rice and discard, then fluff the cooked rice with a fork and stir your black sesame seeds through – this is your black sesame rice

### Step 8

Drain the quick-pickled courgette from the pickling liquid

Serve the Vietnamese-style lemongrass pork and top with the remaining chopped peanuts

Serve the black sesame rice, quick-pickled courgette and carrot salad to the side

Enjoy!
