## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle, then chop your dill finely

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crisp

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop your garlic, then chop your waxy potatoes in half


### Step 3

Once the lardons are crisp, add the sliced leek and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 80ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> milk, your soft cheese and your wholegrain mustard – this is your stock

Once the leek has softened, add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for a further 1-2 min


### Step 4

Add the stock to the pan with your Chinese rice wine and a generous crack of pepper, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly thickened

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Reserve the tray with the baking paper and add the chopped waxy potatoes, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt


### Step 5

Put the waxy potatoes in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour and unwrap your puff pastry, then roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Wash with a little milk and press the chopped dill into the pastry – this is your dill pastry


### Step 6

Add the pulled chicken to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy chicken pie filling

Transfer the creamy chicken pie filling to an oven-proof dish, then lay the dill pastry over the oven-proof dish and trim off any excess

Press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish and put in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through


### Step 7

Trim, then add your green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with the remaining chopped garlic, a large knob of butter and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the green beans to form a sealed parcel[s] and add to a separate baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender with a slight bite – these are your garlicky green beans

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken, leek & bacon pie with dill pastry with the roast potatoes and garlicky green beans to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy
