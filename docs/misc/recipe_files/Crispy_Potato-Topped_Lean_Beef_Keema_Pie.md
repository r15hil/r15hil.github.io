While the lean beef keema is thickening, return the drained potatoes to the pot with the ground turmeric, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Gently mix the potatoes until they're evenly coated in the spices – these are your turmeric potatoes

### Step 7

Transfer the lean beef keema to an oven-proof dish and top it evenly with the turmeric potatoes

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – this is your crispy potato-topped lean beef keema pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Allow the crispy potato-topped lean beef keema pie to cool slightly before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the crispy potato-topped lean beef keema pie

Enjoy!
