## Ingredients

- Smoked streaky bacon (45g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Arborio rice (160g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (90g)
- Butternut squash cubes (160g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Dried sage (1tsp)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop half of your smoked streaky bacon finely (you'll use the rest later!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 2

While the bacon is cooking, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the bacon is starting to crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add the diced shallot and dried sage to the pan

Cook for 3 min further or until the shallot has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> boiled water

Once the shallot has softened, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

While the risotto is cooking, line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add your butternut squash cubes to one side of the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 5

After an initial 10 min, remove the butternut squash from the oven and add the remaining smoked streaky bacon to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the bacon is crispy and the butternut squash is tender


### Step 6

Once the butternut squash is tender, remove the tray[s] from the oven and transfer the cooked squash to the risotto and stir it all together

Transfer the crispy bacon to a clean chopping board and chop roughly – these are your crispy bacon bits


### Step 7

Once the risotto is ready, stir through most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), a generous knob of butter and a generous grind of pepper – this is your creamy bacon & butternut squash risotto

### Step 8

Serve the creamy bacon & butternut squash risotto topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and crispy bacon bits

Enjoy!
