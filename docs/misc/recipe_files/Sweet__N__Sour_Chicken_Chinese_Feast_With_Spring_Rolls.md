## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces, then add to a bowl with most of your cornflour (save 1/2 tsp per person for later!) and mix until the chicken is coated in the flour

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and crispy all over – this is your crispy chicken


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into small pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Once the chicken is crispy, transfer it to a plate and set aside for later, then return the pan to a medium heat

Add the chopped pepper and onion and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Add your vegetable spring rolls to a baking tray and put in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and cooked through


### Step 6

Combine the remaining cornflour in a bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, red chilli relish, ginger & garlic paste and most of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and mix until smooth – this is your sweet & sour sauce

Increase the heat to high, then add the crispy chicken to the pan with the sweet & sour sauce and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your sweet & sour chicken


### Step 7

Add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min or until softened

Drain the soaked noodles and return them to the bowl

Add your toasted sesame oil with the remaining soy sauce and most of the chopped spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) to the bowl and toss until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – these are your sesame noodles

### Step 8

Serve the sweet & sour chicken with the cooked rice, vegetable spring rolls and sesame noodles to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped spring onion

Dig in!
