### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Drain your sweetcorn

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Combine your cornflour, ground coriander, ground cumin, ground turmeric and ginger & garlic paste with your egg[s] (reserving 1 egg per person for later!) in a bowl

Add the drained sweetcorn and your blanched peas with a very generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your fritter mixture

### Step 4

Once the pan is hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 2 per person and cook for 4 min on one side, then 2 min on the other until golden and cooked through – these are your Indian-style pea & sweetcorn fritters

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add half your nigella seeds, then crack the reserved egg[s] into the pan and sprinkle the remaining nigella seeds over the top with a pinch of salt

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking – this is your nigella egg[s]

### Step 6

While the egg[s] and fritters are cooking, bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it roughly

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Loosen your chilli relish with a squeeze of lemon juice

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1650533223751-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the bashed cucumber to a medium bowl with the salad

Squeeze the juice of your lemon[s] over the top with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil and toss together – this is your zingy salad

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style pea & sweetcorn fritters, stacked, with the zingy salad to the side

Top the fritters with a nigella egg and drizzle the chilli relish over the top

Enjoy!
