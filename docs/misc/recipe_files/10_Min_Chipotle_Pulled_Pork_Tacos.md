## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready


Skim through these steps


Wash your fruit and veg


Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. <span class="text-highlight">Make sure</span> you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!


Boil a kettle


Chop the tomatoes roughly


Trim, then chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Mix the spring onion and tomatoes and chop them together for 30 sec until combined then add to a bowl with a pinch of salt and set aside – this is your tomato salsa


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the pulled pork with the ground cumin and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your spicy stock


Once fragrant, add the spicy stock to the pan with the soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your chipotle pulled pork


### Step 5

While the sauce is thickening, shred the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 6

Add the tortillas to a plate


Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 1-2 min, or until the tortillas are warmed through


### Step 7

While the tortillas are in the microwave, cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Combine the mayonnaise with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime and give it a good mix up – this is your lime mayo


Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Set the warmed tortillas, shredded gem, chipotle pulled pork, tomato salsa and lime mayo in the centre of the table, ready to share


Garnish with the lime wedges, grate the cheddar cheese over the assembled tacos and let everyone dig in!


Enjoy!
