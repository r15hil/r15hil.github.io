## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 4-6 min or until browned and starting to caramelise, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 3

Combine your peanut butter, red chilli relish, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a bowl

Add the soy sauce and the juice of half your lime[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your satay sauce

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 4

Once the pork mince has browned, add the chopped ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix to the pan

Add your basmati rice with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil

Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-12 min or until the water is absorbed, the rice is cooked and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, halve your cucumber lengthways then scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon, discard the seeds

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)


### Step 6

Add the sliced cucumber, radishes and spring onion to a bowl

Add your rice vinegar and a generous pinch of salt

Mix well and set aside to pickle – this is your pickled cucumber & radish salad


### Step 7

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stems

Chop your roasted peanuts roughly

Once the rice is cooked, stir through the chopped mint leaves, coriander and peanuts – this is your lean pork rice

### Step 8

Serve the lean pork rice with the pickled cucumber & radish salad to the side

Drizzle with the satay sauce

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
