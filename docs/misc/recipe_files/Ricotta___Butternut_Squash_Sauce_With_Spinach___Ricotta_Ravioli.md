## Ingredients

- 250g spinach & ricotta ravioli
- 160g butternut squash cubes
- 80g shredded kale
- 15g pumpkin seeds
- 100g ricotta
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min or until the squash cubes are fork-tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic


### Step 4

Add the spinach & ricotta ravioli and shredded kale to a pot with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli and kale for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite and the kale has wilted

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Add the cooked butternut squash to a food processor with half the ricotta (you'll use the rest later), 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water and a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until you are left with a smooth sauce – this is your ricotta & butternut squash sauce


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat, pour in the ricotta & butternut squash sauce and give everything a good stir


### Step 7

Add the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli & kale to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your ricotta & butternut squash sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Tip: Add an extra splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick

### Step 8

Serve the ricotta & butternut squash sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Top with the remaining ricotta and pumpkin seeds, then season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
