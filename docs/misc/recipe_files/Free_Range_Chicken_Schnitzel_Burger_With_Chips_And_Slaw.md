### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are in the oven, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Add the diced shallot to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and your white wine vinegar and set aside for later

### Step 3

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into discs, then slice each apple disc into matchsticks

Chop your dill finely

Add the grated carrot, apple matchsticks and chopped dill to the bowl of diced shallot along with your mayo, a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper – this is your apple & dill slaw

### Step 4

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your chicken escalope

### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs and ground smoked paprika to a plate and season with salt and pepper

Spread your Dijon mustard over both sides of the chicken escalope using the back of a spoon

Press the chicken escalope into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken schnitzel

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, slice your brioche bun[s] in half and put them in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill the warmed brioche bun with the free range chicken schnitzel and some apple & dill slaw

Serve with the chips and any remaining apple & dill slaw to the side

Enjoy!
