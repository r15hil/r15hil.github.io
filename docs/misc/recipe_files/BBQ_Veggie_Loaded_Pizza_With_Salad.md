- Red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your sweetcorn


### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add the bbq sauce to a bowl with your tomato paste, chopped garlic, dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your bbq base


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add the pizza bases

Divide the bbq base between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon


### Step 6

Top with the pepper strips, sliced red onion, drained sweetcorn and torn mozzarella

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your bbq veggie loaded pizzas

Tip: Make sure the pizzas don’t overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!


### Step 7

Once the pizzas are nearly done, wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Toss it all together – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the bbq veggie loaded pizzas and top with the dressed salad

Enjoy!
