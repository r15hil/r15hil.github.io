## Ingredients

- 0 bulgur wheat
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 red chilli 
- 1 courgette
- 0 baharat
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp baharat
- 200g halloumi
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 25g honey
- 5g parsley
- 1 garlic clove
- 4 skewers
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Soak the skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large bite-sized pieces

Chop your halloumi into large bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Add the chopped halloumi to a large bowl with the chopped courgette, pepper, garlic and chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your baharat with a drizzle of olive oil and a good grind of pepper

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Give everything a good mix up, then thread the halloumi and veg evenly onto 2 soaked skewers per person

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a baking tray (or two), then  evenly onto  i & veg skewers and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until starting to soften – these are your halloumi, pepper & courgette kebabs


### Step 5

While the kebabs are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a small pot over a medium heat with your ground cumin, ground coriander and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar, honey, natural yoghurt and a pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your sweet & tangy yoghurt


### Step 7

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish)

Fluff the bulgur wheat with a fork and stir through the chopped parsley  – this is your spiced bulgur

### Step 8

Serve the halloumi, pepper & courgette kebabs over the spiced bulgur

Drizzle over the sweet & tangy yoghurt and garnish with the remaining parsley leaves

Enjoy!
