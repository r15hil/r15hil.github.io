## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 350g gnocchi
- 60g garlic & herb spread
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 30g sun-dried tomato paste
- 80g baby leaf spinach

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably nonstick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

When the pan with the vegetable oil is hot, add the diced chicken thigh with the sun-dried tomato paste and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown

Once the other pan is hot, add the gnocchi and season with a pinch of salt


### Step 4

Cook the gnocchi for 4-5 min or until golden and starting to crisp

Tip: Give the gnocchi a shake in the pan once in a while to make sure they are crisping all over!

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once the chicken has started to brown, remove the pan from the heat, then add the spinach and halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and black pepper

Return the pan to the heat, then cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, add the chicken stock mix and garlic & herb spread to the pan with 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy tomato & chicken sauce


### Step 7

Once golden and crisp, add the gnocchi to the creamy tomato & chicken sauce and stir it all together – this is your creamy tomato & chicken gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Set the creamy tomato & chicken gnocchi in the centre of the table, ready to share

Enjoy!
