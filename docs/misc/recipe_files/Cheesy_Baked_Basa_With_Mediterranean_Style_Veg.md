## Description

This dishy dinner is inspired by the Mediterranean sun. While the fish and potatoes brown in the oven, you'll braise colourful veg to serve alongside. What a catch! All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your roast potatoes

### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the oven, boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your red onion[s] roughly

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>boiled water

### Step 3

Grate your cheddar cheese into a bowl, add your panko breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper

### Step 4

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb mix over the fillet[s] until they're totally covered

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min, or until the breadcrumb mixture is starting to turn golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your cheesy baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

While the basa is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette<span class="text-danger"> </span>and tomato paste to the pan<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened
