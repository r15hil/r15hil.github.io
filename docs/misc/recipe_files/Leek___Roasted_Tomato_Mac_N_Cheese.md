### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves and top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Once melted, add the sliced leek and diced shallot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[20g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the leek – this is your leek roux

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Top with your cherry tomatoes and the cheesy breadcrumbs and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your leek & roasted tomato mac 'n' cheese

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dress the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Serve your leek & roasted tomato mac 'n' cheese with a generous grind of black pepper and the dressed salad to the side
