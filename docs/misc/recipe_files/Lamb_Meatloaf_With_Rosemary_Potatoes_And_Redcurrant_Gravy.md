### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 5 and boil half a kettle

Chop the waxy potatoes in half

Strip the rosemary and mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems, then chop the mint roughly

Peel and grate 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> red onion and finely dice the remaining onion

### Step 2

Combine half of the redcurrant jelly (you'll use the rest later!) with the tomato ketchup in a bowl – this is your redcurrant glaze

In a separate bowl, dissolve half of the beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> boiled water, then add the lamb mince, panko breadcrumbs, grated onion, diced onion and chopped mint

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and knead thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined – this is your lamb mixture

### Step 3

Add the lamb mixture to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and shape into 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>loaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>

Add the halved potatoes to the other side of the tray with the rosemary leaves, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – these are your rosemary roast potatoes

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 4

Spread the redcurrant glaze over the top of the meatloaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and put the tray in the oven for 35-40 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your minty lamb meatloaf

Meanwhile, top, tail and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into batons

Add the carrot batons to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the meatloaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> have been in oven for 10 min, put the carrot batons in the oven and cook for an initial 10 min

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1584954987648-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Cut 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1584954995570-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle of the tin foil with the sliced garlic and a few small knobs of butter

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Once the carrot batons have had 10 min, add the parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the tray and return it to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until tender – these are your garlicky spring greens

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1584955014726-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Reboil half a kettle, then dissolve the remaining beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water with the remaining redcurrant jelly – this is your redcurrant stock

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat, and once melted add 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Add the redcurrant stock and a generous pinch of pepper then whisk until combined and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your redcurrant gravy

### Step 8

Slice the lamb meatloaf and serve with the rosemary roast potatoes, carrot batons and garlicky spring greens to the side

Drizzle the redcurrant gravy all over

Enjoy!
