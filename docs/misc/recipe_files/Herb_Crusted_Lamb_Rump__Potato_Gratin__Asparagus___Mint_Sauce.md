### Step 1

Set the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 350°F/ Gas 4

Boil a kettle

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> chicken stock powder (save the rest for later!) in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water - this is your chicken stock

Heat a pot over a medium heat with a small knob of butter (approx. 1 tsp)

Once melted, add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 minutes or until a roux (sandy paste) has formed

### Step 2

Stir the chicken stock gradually into the roux and cook for 1-2 minutes

Add the crème fraîche and a generous grind of pepper and stir well until combined.

Peel and finely slice the potatoes. Layer the sliced potatoes in an oven-proof dish and top with the sauce

Put the dish in the oven for 1 hour or until the potatoes are golden and cooked through

### Step 3

Meanwhile, pat the lamb rump dry with kitchen paper and season all over with a pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lamb and cook for 4-5 min or until golden all over

Transfer the lamb to a baking tray (reserve the pan!) and set aside in a warm place

### Step 4

Re-boil a kettle

Chop the parsley finely, then peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the panko breadcrumbs with the chopped parsley, garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic & herb crumb

### Step 5

Dissolve the remaining chicken stock powder in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water

Return the pan to a medium heat and once hot, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 minutes or until a roux (sandy paste) has formed

Add the mint sauce, soy sauce and chicken stock gradually into the roux and cook for 8-10 minutes or until you have a gravy-like consistency – this is your mint jus

Once done, remove from the heat and reheat before serving

### Step 6

Meanwhile, spread Dijon mustard all over the lamb and press the garlic & herb crumb into the mustard

Push the lamb to one side of the tray

Add the Chantenay carrots to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Increase the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Put the tray on the top shelf of the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the lamb is pink and blushing

### Step 7

Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a plate and set aside to rest in a warm place for 10-15 minutes

Return the carrots to the oven for a further 10-15 minutes or until tender

Meanwhile, re-boil a kettle

Add the asparagus spears to a pot, cover them with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4 minutes or until tender

Once tender, drain

### Step 8

Once ready to serve, slice the rested lamb

Serve the sliced lamb with the potato gratin, Chantenay carrots, asparagus and mint jus to the side

Enjoy!
