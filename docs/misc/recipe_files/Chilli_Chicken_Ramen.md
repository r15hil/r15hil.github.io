## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 3 Sriracha hot chilli sauce sachets (24ml)
- 1 Kallo chicken stock cube
- 1 soy sauce sachet (15ml)
- 130g medium egg noodles
- 10g coriander
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 1 spring onion
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1/2 lime
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate the ginger, then combine it in a bowl with the soy sauce – this is your ginger soy marinade

Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces


### Step 2

Add the sliced chicken to the ginger soy marinade and give everything a good mix up

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Add the chicken to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, peel and slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(as finely as you can!)

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Tip: Deseed them if you can't handle the heat!


### Step 4

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Cut 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime into wedges

Pick the coriander leaves from the stalks


### Step 5

Dissolve the Kallo chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and Sriracha hot chilli sauce in 500ml<span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water – this is your spicy ramen base

Add the spicy ramen base to a pot over a very-low heat and cook for 5-6 min or until warmed through

Re-boil a kettle


### Step 6

Add the medium egg noodles to a separate pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the cooked chicken from the oven and slice it finely

### Step 8

Add the drained noodles to deep bowls and pour over the spicy ramen base

Top with the sliced chicken, sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a handful of sliced red onion, spring onion, coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
