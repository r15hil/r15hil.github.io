### Step 1

Combine the shredded red cabbage with the red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then set aside – this is your pickled red cabbage

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Peel and roughly chop the garlic, then chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks

### Step 2

Add the drained chickpeas to a food processor with the chopped parsley, chopped garlic and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Add the panko breadcrumbs, ground cumin, soy sauce, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Pulse until everything is blitzed but not smooth – this is your falafel mix

### Step 3

Shape the falafel mix into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> falafel balls and press then down using a plate, to flatten them slightly – these are your falafels

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Tip: This is to warm your tortillas later – alternatively, add them to a plate and pop in the microwave for 1-2 min

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the falafels and cook for 3-4 min on each side until golden brown and starting to crisp

Tip: Add another splash of oil if the pan is looking a little dry!

Once done, add to a plate lined with kitchen paper and set aside

### Step 5

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the remaining lemon into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>wedges

Add the mayo to a small bowl with the chilli jam and give it a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli mayo

### Step 6

Once the falafels are almost cooked, add the tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 3 min until warmed through

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1635942756748-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Divide the pickled red cabbage, grated carrot and baby leaf salad evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with 2 falafels and drizzle over most of the sweet chilli mayo (save some for dipping!) – these are your falafel wraps

### Step 8

Serve the falafel wraps with the lemon wedges and remaining sweet chilli mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
