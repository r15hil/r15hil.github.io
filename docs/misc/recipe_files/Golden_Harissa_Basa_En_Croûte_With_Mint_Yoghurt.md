## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your turmeric potatoes


### Step 2

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut into 1 rectangle per person, add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and prick the pastry all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 3

Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste in a bowl with your vegetable stock mix – this is your harissa mix

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Top each pastry rectangle with a basa fillet, covering only one half

Spoon the harissa mix evenly over the basa


### Step 4

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, using a fork to crimp along the join


### Step 5

Combine the remaining ground turmeric with a drizzle of vegetable oil and mix it all together – this is your turmeric oil

Brush the pastry with the turmeric oil until fully coated

Use the tip of a sharp knife to lightly score diagonal lines across the top the pastry

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the fish is cooked through and the pastry is golden, cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your golden harissa basa en croûte


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Combine the chopped mint and natural yoghurt in a bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your mint yoghurt


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and spinach and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant and the spinach has wilted

Once the potatoes are cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the turmeric potatoes to the spinach with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – these are your buttery spinach potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the golden harissa basa en croûte with the buttery spinach potatoes and mint yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!
