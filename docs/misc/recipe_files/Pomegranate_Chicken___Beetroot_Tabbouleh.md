### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Add the bulgur to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and the chicken stock mix

Pour in the beetroot juice from the packet, cover and set aside

Tip: The beetroot juice will turn your bulgur bright pink!

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add most of the ground sumac (save a pinch for garnish!), soy sauce and half of the pomegranate molasses (save the rest for later!) to a plate with a generous grind of pepper and mix it together

Add the chicken breasts and turn until well coated

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pomegranate chicken

### Step 4

Slice the cucumber in half lengthways and scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon

Discard the seeds and finely dice the cucumber

Grate the beetroot roughly

### Step 5

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Trim and finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 6

Once the bulgur has absorbed all of the water, fluff it with a fork

Add the grated beetroot, diced cucumber, sliced spring onion, chopped herbs and juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Add a grind of black pepper and gently mix it all together – this is your beetroot tabbouleh

### Step 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the natural yoghurt to a small bowl with the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), remaining pomegranate molasses and a pinch of salt

Stir once or twice to swirl the pomegranate molasses through the yoghurt – this is your marbled yoghurt

Slice the remaining lemon into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wedges

### Step 8

Slice the pomegranate chicken and serve it over the beetroot tabbouleh with the marbled yoghurt to the side

Garnish with the lemon wedges and sprinkle over the reserved ground sumac

Enjoy!
