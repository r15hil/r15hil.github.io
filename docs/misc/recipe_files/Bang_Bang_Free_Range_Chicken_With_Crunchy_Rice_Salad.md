## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[350ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 2

Once the rice is cooked, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden


### Step 3

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Top, tail, peel, then grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add the shredded lettuce, grated carrot and sliced spring onion to a large mixing bowl


### Step 4

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-low and sprinkle your five-spice mix over the chicken and turn several times until evenly coated in the spice

Cook for 1 min further, then add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, cut your cucumber into discs

Stack a few cucumber discs at a time and cut each stack into matchsticks

Cut half of your red chilli[es] into rounds (save the rest for later!)

Add the cucumber matchsticks and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with the shredded lettuce, carrot and spring onion – this is your crunchy salad


### Step 6

Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Combine your peanut butter and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a bowl and mix well until you have a smooth paste

Add your soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix well to combine – this is your peanut dressing


### Step 7

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Once done, season the pulled chicken with a pinch of salt – this is your bang bang free range chicken

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to the crunchy salad – this is your crunchy rice salad

Toss the crunchy rice salad in a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the bang bang free range chicken over the crunchy rice salad and drizzle the peanut dressing all over

Garnish with a sprinkling of your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
