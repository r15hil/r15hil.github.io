## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Remove the leaves from the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and trim the root 


Heat a large pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt over a medium-high heat 


Once boiling, add the whole cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 7 min

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces 


Once ready, remove the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the pot and transfer to a baking tray (reserve the pot and water!) 


Leave the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to steam-dry for 5 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the chopped potatoes to the reserved cauliflower water and bring to a boil over a medium-high heat 


Cook for 15-20 min or until the potatoes are very soft


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the pecans to the other side of the baking tray and drizzle with the agave nectar 


Drizzle the cauliflower with a generous glug of vegetable oil and season with a large pinch of salt 


Put the baking tray in the oven and cook for 20 min, removing the pecans after 7 min


Once removed, leave the agave nectar to set on the pecans – these are your candied pecans


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and crush or grate the garlic


Chop the parsley very finely 


Chop the capers roughly 


Combine the chopped garlic, capers, parsley, red wine vinegar, soy sauce and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> olive oil with a splash of cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salsa verde


Tip: alternatively, you can use a blender to blitz everything!


### Step 6

Once soft, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot 


Add the free from mayo and mash until smooth


Season generously with salt

Chop the candied pecans very roughly

### Step 8

Dollop the mashed potato onto plates and top with cauliflower halves


Drizzle with the salsa verde 


Garnish with the chopped candied pecans 


Enjoy!
