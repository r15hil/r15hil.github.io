## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into quarters


### Step 3

Once the chicken is lightly browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, creamed coconut and red Thai curry paste in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red Thai-style stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has slightly softened, add the chopped sweet potato to the pan with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add the red Thai-style stock with a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for an initial 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

After the initial 15-20 min, remove the lid and add the chopped spring onion

Cook for a further 3-4 min, or until the sauce has started to thicken – this is your red Thai-style chicken & sweet potato curry


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 8

Serve the red Thai-style chicken & sweet potato curry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
