## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Chop your cauliflower[s] into small florets and separate any leaves from the stem[s]

Discard the stem[s] and keep the leaves

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potato and half the cauliflower florets (you'll use the rest later!) to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min

Once everything is fork-tender and easy to mash, drain and set aside


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the cauliflower leaves and remaining cauliflower florets to a large baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Give it a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until the cauliflower is golden and the leaves are crispy

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add most of the chopped onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then dissolve your vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chopped<span class="text-danger"> </span>creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and tomato paste and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Add the drained potato & cauliflower florets with the coconut stock and mash until smooth but still retaining some texture

Add your blanched peas and the juice of half your lime[s] and cook for 2 min further


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and lightly golden – this is your chilli brioche

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, top the warmed chilli brioche with your favourite butter alternative


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pan and stir it all together

Cook for 1-2 min further or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your cauliflower pav bhaji

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the cauliflower pav bhaji

Top with the golden cauliflower and crispy cauliflower leaves and serve the chilli brioche to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped coriander, remaining chopped red onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
