Boil a half a kettle

### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your garlic rice

### Step 5

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until crisp and brown

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your red wine vinegar, half of your ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!), grated carrot and sliced radishes to a bowl with a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled vegetables

### Step 7

Once the fable pulled mushrooms have crisped, add your mirin, tamari soy sauce, remaining ginger & garlic paste and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> [4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 1-2 min or until coated – this is your Fable pulled mushroom teriyaki

Add your mangetout to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften

Drain the mangetout

### Step 8

Serve the Fable pulled mushroom teriyaki over the garlic rice, with the quick-pickled vegetables and mangetout to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion greens

Enjoy!
