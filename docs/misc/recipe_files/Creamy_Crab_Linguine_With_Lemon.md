## Ingredients

- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Chives (5g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- British white crab meat (50g) x0
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- British white crab meat (100g)
- Cornish clotted cream (40g)
- Garlic clove x3
- Chinese rice wine (15ml) x0
- Chinese rice wine (30ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Score a cross very lightly in the base of your tomato[es] and add them to a large, heat-proof bowl

Cover them with boiled water until they’re fully submerged and set them aside for 5 min

Tip: The boiling water loosens the skins for easy peeling in step 4!


### Step 2

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8 min, or until cooked with a slight bite

While the pasta cooks, drain the tomato[es], then refill the bowl with ice-cold water and set them aside to cool

Once the pasta is cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Chop your chives finely

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> [100ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Drain then peel the skin off the tomato[es], starting from the cross

Chop the tomato[es] into quarters, scoop out and discard the seeds so that you end up with tomato petals

Carefully and using a sharp knife, dice the tomato petals – this is your tomato concasse


### Step 5

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil to large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a low heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and lemon zest and cook for 1 min until golden and aromatic


### Step 6

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min or until it’s evaporated

Once evaporated, add the vegetable stock and cook for a further 2 min or until it’s reduced down to a sauce


### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in your crab meat, clotted cream, Dijon mustard, half of the tomato concasse and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for later!)

Add the cooked linguine and the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your creamy crab linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy crab linguine topped with the remaining tomato concasse and remaining chopped chives

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges, garnish with a lemon wedge, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!
