## Ingredients

- Proper Porker sausages (3pcs) x0
- Proper Porker sausages (6pcs)
- Garlic clove x2
- Rosemary (5g)
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- White potato x4
- Honey (25g)
- Spring greens (150g)
- Red onion x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thick discs

Chop your red onion[s] into wedges through the root, keeping the skin on

Tip: Cutting through the root ensures that they stay together while cooking


### Step 2

Add the red onion wedges and potato discs to one side of a large baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper

Add the sausages to a sheet of tin foil, scrunching up the edges, and place on the other side


### Step 3

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min, or until the onions are tender and the sausages have browned

Meanwhile, combine your honey and wholegrain mustard in a small mixing bowl – this is your honey mustard mixture

Strip your rosemary leaves from the stems and chop finely, discard the stems

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 5

Once the onions are tender, transfer them to a chopping board to cool

Flip the potato discs

Pour the honey mustard mixture over the browned sausages – these are your sticky honey mustard sausages


### Step 6

Return the potato discs and sausages to the oven for 5 min or until the honey mustard mixture is hot and sticky, the potato discs are golden and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the onions are cool enough to handle, remove the skins

Separate the roasted onion into petals


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the chopped rosemary, chopped garlic and sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min

Add a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for a final 1-2 min or until tender but retaining a slight crunch, then remove from the heat – these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Serve the golden potato discs, garlicky greens and roasted onion petals all tumbled together

Top with the sticky honey mustard sausages

Spoon any remaining honey mustard mixture over the sausages

Enjoy!
