## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 1 gem lettuce
- 18g Dijon mustard
- 2 ciabattas
- 15ml cider vinegar
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 8g Marmite
- 1 shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Add the chicken breast portions to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast portions, being careful not to cut all the way through, then open them out like a book

Cover them with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until they are of even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

Crush the crispy onions with a rolling pin in their bag<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and add them to a plate

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Evenly coat both sides of the butterflied chicken in the Dijon mustard using the back of a spoon (not a mustard fan? Go easy!)

Add the coated chicken to the plate of crispy onions – this is your mustard & onion chicken

Add the mustard & onion chicken to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray and set aside

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot with a small pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, slice the ciabattas in half

Once softened, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour to the pan and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 5

Whisk in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water with the beef stock mix, Marmite and half the cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly thickened – this is your gravy

Once slightly thickened, remove the pan from the heat and dip the ciabatta halves into the gravy until almost soaked through – this is your gravy bread

Tip: You should have roughly half of the gravy left over in the pan, which will be used later!


### Step 6

Transfer the gravy bread to the other side of the tray with the mustard & onion chicken

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 16-17 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the bread is crispy on the outside


### Step 7

Once the chicken has been cooking for 10 min, return the gravy to a medium heat with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency

Meanwhile, combine the remaining cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your dressing

Wash the gem lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, remove 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> leaves and set aside, then shred the inner core

### Step 8

To assemble, top each gravy bread base with the mustard & onion chicken, a couple of lettuce leaves, then finish with the gravy bread lid – this is your crispy chicken & onion gravy sandwich

Serve the chips and shredded lettuce to the side with the dressing drizzled over

Pour the remaining gravy into a small bowl, ready for dipping

Enjoy!
