## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] (skin-side down) then season with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your green lentils

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, trim then add your green beans and cook for 1-2 min

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Add the drained lentils and spinach and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and wilted


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your lemon[s] in half

Combine your wholegrain mustard, the juice of half your lemon[s], 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mustard dressing


### Step 7

Add the chopped spring onion to the lentils and cook for 1 min further

Remove the pan from the heat and add the mustard dressing – these are your dressed lentils

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the salmon over the dressed lentils

Garnish with your pumpkin seeds and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
