## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel and chop your red onion[s] and dice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Chop your coconut flakes roughly and chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 2

Combine the diced tomatoes, chopped coconut flakes, and chopped parsley with half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1/4 of the chopped red onion (save the rest for later!) in a bowl

Add the juice of half your lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut sambal


### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pods

Once hot, add the cardamom seeds, curry powder, black mustard seeds, and a very generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, transfer to a small bowl and set aside for later – this is your toasted curry powder

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the remaining chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 6

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then trim the fat and discard

Chop the pork loin steak[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add the chopped pork to the pan

Cook for 5-6 min or until the pork is beginning to brown all over


### Step 7

Add the chopped ginger, garlic, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the toasted curry powder and cook for 1 min further

Add your tamarind paste with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> water, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar and the juice of the remaining lime and cook for 5-6 min further or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Sri Lankan-style pork curry

### Step 8

Season the Sri Lankan-style pork curry with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together

Serve the Sri Lankan-style pork curry over the basmati rice with the coconut sambal to the side

Enjoy!
