## Description

What makes this delicious lamb lasagne Moroccan is the addition of ras el hanout, a wonderfully redolent North African spice blend. We've added dates and sultanas for some natural sweetness. Layered with iron-rich kale and a simple homemade b√©chamel sauce, this is comfort food with a temptingly exotic twist!

Peel and chop the brown&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely&nbsp;


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;over a medium-high&nbsp;heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the chopped&nbsp;onion,&nbsp;chopped carrot,&nbsp;a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and cook for 5-8 min or until&nbsp;softened


Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken&nbsp;stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 300ml&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water


### Step 3

Once the carrot and onion has softened, add the lamb mince,&nbsp;ras el hanout and chopped&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking the mince up as you go


Add the tomato paste, chicken&nbsp;stock, chopped&nbsp;dates,&nbsp;sultanas&nbsp;and shredded&nbsp;kale to the pan


Cover with a lid and cook for 5 min&nbsp;


Season generously with salt and pepper &ndash;&nbsp;this is your meat sauce


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter to a pot over a medium heat


Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;flour and stir for 2-3 min until a sandy coloured paste is formed &ndash; this is your roux


### Step 5

Stir 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;milk gradually into the roux


Whisk&nbsp;constantly for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then remove from the heat


Season with salt and pepper and set aside &ndash; this is your b&eacute;chamel sauce


### Step 6

Spoon a layer of the b&eacute;chamel sauce&nbsp;over the bottom of an oven-proof dish


Layer 3 lasagne sheets&nbsp;over, then spread half of the meat sauce&nbsp;over


Repeat until all of your lasagne sheets have been used up, finishing with a layer of b&eacute;chamel, then scatter the panko breadcrumbs evenly over the top &ndash; this is your lasagne&nbsp;


Tip: scattering from up high ensures even distribution!


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven for 25-30&nbsp;min or until the lasagne&nbsp;is cooked and the breadcrumbs are golden brown


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Leave the lasagne to cool slightly before serving as it will be extremely hot


Enjoy!
