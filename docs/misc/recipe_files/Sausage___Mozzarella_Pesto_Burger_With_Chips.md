## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Bread Roll x2
- Tomato
- Fennel seeds (1tsp)
- Sun-dried tomato pesto (45g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Sausage meat (150g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3
- Gem lettuce
- Mozzarella (125g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with your dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your oregano chips


### Step 2

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind to a fine powder

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and crushed fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!)

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 patty per person, then refrigerate until later


### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Slice the drained mozzarella in half

Slice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds

Combine your sun-dried tomato pesto and mayo in a bowl – this is your pesto mayo


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage patty[ies] and cook for 5 min on one side or until browned

Tip: Press the patty down with a spatula to keep nice and flat throughout cooking


### Step 5

Once browned, flip the sausage patty[ies] and top with the halved mozzarella

Cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the cheese has melted and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy patty


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce then pat dry with kitchen paper, and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce to a bowl with your balsamic vinegar and a generous drizzle of olive oil and toss it all together – this is your balsamic salad


### Step 7

Slice your bread roll[s] in half

Add the bread roll halves to the toaster and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread a dollop of pesto mayo over the toasted bread roll base, top with a cheesy patty, sliced tomato, a handful of balsamic salad and a toasted bread roll lid – this is your sausage & mozzarella pesto burger

Serve with the oregano chips, remaining pesto mayo and remaining balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!
