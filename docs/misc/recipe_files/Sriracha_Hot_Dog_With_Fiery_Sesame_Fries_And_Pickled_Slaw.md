## Ingredients

- Crispy onions (15g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Brioche style hot dog buns (2pcs)
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Rice vinegar (15ml) x0
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml) x2
- Pork sausage x2
- Carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix (160g)
- White potato x3
- Rice vinegar (30ml)
- Spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips


### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

Once golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds – these are your fiery sesame fries


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your mooli slaw mix and rice vinegar to a bowl with a small pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled mooli slaw


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your hot dog sausage[s] and cook for 10-12 min, turning frequently until browned all over and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

While the sausage[s] is cooking, combine your mayo and remaining sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your sriracha mayo


### Step 7

Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s]

Add the cut hot dog bun[s] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill the hot dog bun with a hot dog, then top with your crispy onions and some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw and sriracha mayo

Serve the remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw and fiery sesame fries to the side

Drizzle the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo and top with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
