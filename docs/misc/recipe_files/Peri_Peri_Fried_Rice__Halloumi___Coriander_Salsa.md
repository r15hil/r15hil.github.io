## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your halloumi into 3 pieces per person


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely (including the stalks)

Combine the chopped coriander and your white wine vinegar in a small bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coriander salsa


### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 6

Once the pepper is soft, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground turmeric and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked white long grain rice and your blanched peas to the pan along with a splash of water and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your spicy rice


### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a separate pan over a high heat

Once hot, add the halloumi pieces and cook on each side for 1-2 min until golden

### Step 8

Serve the spicy rice and top with the pan-fried halloumi

Drizzle the coriander salsa over everything

Enjoy!
