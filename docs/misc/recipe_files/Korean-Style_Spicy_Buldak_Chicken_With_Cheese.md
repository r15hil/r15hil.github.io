### Step 1

Before you start cooking take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

### Step 2

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate into petals

Peel and finely chop your garlic and peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop your ginger

Add the chopped onion, garlic and ginger to a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)

Tip: Keep off the heat for now!

### Step 4

Add your diced chicken thigh to the pan with your gochujang paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

### Step 5

Add the pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant and the chicken is starting to brown

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-low, add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Tip: If the sauce is a little thin, remove the lid and cook over a high heat for 2-3 min further or until thickened

### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, pre-heat the grill to medium-high, then trim and cut your green beans in half

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your toasted sesame oil and halved green beans and cook for 6-7 min or until tender

Once done, sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds all over and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame green beans

### Step 7

Whilst the green beans are cooking, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the mozzarella over the cooked chicken and put the pan under the grill for 4-5 min or until golden and melted – this is your Korean-style spicy buldak chicken with cheese

Tip: Watch out for your hot pan handle! If your pan isn't oven-proof, transfer it to an oven-proof dish instead

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

Serve the Korean-style spicy buldak chicken with cheese in a bowl with the sesame green beans and sticky rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
