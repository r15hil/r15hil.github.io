## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 400g pizza dough
- 8 tbsp canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 125g baby plum tomatoes
- 125g mozzarella
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Cut the PizzaExpress pizza dough in half

Shape the dough into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> balls and set aside for 15 min


### Step 2

Dice the mozzarella into small bite-sized pieces and add to some kitchen paper

Press down on the diced mozzarella with another piece of kitchen paper to squeeze out as much liquid as you can


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the chopped garlic with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic oil

Slice the baby plum tomatoes in half


### Step 4

Once the dough balls have rested for 15 min, press your palm into the middle of a dough ball to flatten it until it is twice as wide

Turn the dough over and repeat a few times, until approx. 24cm in diameter (use a rolling pin to help you!)

Repeat with the other dough ball<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>– these are your pizza bases

Transfer the pizza bases to a baking paper-lined baking tray


### Step 5

Spread 4 tbsp finely chopped tomatoes over each pizza base (save the rest for another recipe!)

Season with a pinch of salt

Top with the halved tomatoes, diced mozzarella and dried oregano

Drizzle over the garlic oil and season with a double pinch of black pepper


### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 9-19 min or until the pizza bases are golden and crisp and the mozzarella has melted

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may have to do this in batches!


### Step 7

Once the pizzas are ready, top them with basil leaves

Drizzle over a little olive oil – these are your margherita pomodoro pizzas

### Step 8

Serve the margherita pomodoro pizza

Enjoy!
