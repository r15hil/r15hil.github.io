### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add the chicken thighs to a bowl with the ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it all a good mix up until the thighs are evenly coated with the spice

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

Once crisp, transfer to a baking tray and set aside (reserve the pan)

Tip: It’s okay if they’re a little pink on the inside, they’ll get cooked more later

### Step 3

While the chicken thighs are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel and dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3-4 min

Add the chopped garlic, ground cumin, ground paprika, chilli flakes and tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Meanwhile, rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear

Once fragrant, add the white long grain rice to the pan with a pinch of salt and stir until coated

### Step 5

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 2250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and the saffron (not a big saffron fan? Try using less!) – this is your saffron stock

Add the saffron stock to the pan and give everything a good mix up

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1610471230248-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked through

Once the rice is cooked through, add the blanched peas to the pan and mix everything together – this is your Brazilian saffron rice

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 7

When the rice has about 10 min remaining, put the tray with the chicken in the oven and cook for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky crispy chicken

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Top the Brazilian saffron rice with smoky crispy chicken

Garnish with the chopped coriander and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
