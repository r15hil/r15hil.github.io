- White long grain rice (130g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g)
- White long grain rice (65g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine and your Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the vegetables are softened and lightly golden – this is your roasted veg


### Step 3

While the veg is roasting, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 4

Combine the chopped ginger, your rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy), toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> brown sugar in a bowl

Give it a good mix up – this is your teriyaki sauce


### Step 5

Once the rice is cooked, add your blanched peas on top of the rice and put the lid back on for 3 min until the peas are warmed through


### Step 6

Once the roasted veg is done, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the roasted veg with the teriyaki sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has reduced to a sticky consistency – this is your aubergine & Tenderstem teriyaki


### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Remove the aubergine & Tenderstem teriyaki from the heat and add your toasted sesame seeds to the pan

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine & Tenderstem teriyaki over the cooked rice and peas

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
