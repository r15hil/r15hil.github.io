Add the chopped veg and garlic to an oven-proof dish with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Cover the dish with tin foil and put it in the oven for an initial 20 min

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to use 2 dishes!


### Step 4

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

Season with a pinch of salt and mix thoroughly – this is your salsa verde


### Step 7

Remove the roasted vegetables from the oven and take off the tin foil

Lay your basa fillet[s] over the top of the vegetables with a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper and return the dish to the oven for a final 12-15 min
