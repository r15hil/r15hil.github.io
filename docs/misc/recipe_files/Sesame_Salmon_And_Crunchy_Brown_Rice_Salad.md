## Ingredients

- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 130g brown rice
- 2 x 110g skin on salmon fillets
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 15ml tamari soy sauce
- 0 80g brown rice
- 5g coriander
- 125g radishes
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/220°C(fan)/ gas 7, then rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the salmon fillets to a baking tray, skin-side down with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the salmon fillets and press down firmly with your hand so that they stick

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your sesame salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

Meanwhile, top, tail and slice the radishes (as finely as you can)

Slice the cucumber finely

Cut the sugar snap peas in half lengthways


### Step 4

Peel and grate the garlic

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Cut 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wedges


### Step 5

Combine the grated garlic (don't like raw garlic? Use half!) with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, the tamari soy sauce and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a large bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and stir it all together – this is your chilli & lime dressing


### Step 6

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the brown rice, sliced radishes, sliced cucumber and chopped sugar snap peas to the bowl with the chilli & lime dressing

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your crunchy brown rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the sesame salmon over the crunchy brown rice salad with a lime wedge to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
