## Ingredients

- Spring onion x2
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Hoisin sauce (20g) x0
- Hoisin sauce (40g)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat


### Step 2

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid, then cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into thin strips


### Step 5

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling' – this is your shredded chicken


### Step 7

Return the shredded chicken to the pan with your hoisin sauce and your soy sauce and cook for 2 min or until warmed through – this is your shredded hoisin free range chicken

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

### Step 8

Assemble the wraps by dividing the shredded lettuce, spring onion strips, cucumber matchsticks and shredded hoisin free range chicken between the warmed tortillas

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
