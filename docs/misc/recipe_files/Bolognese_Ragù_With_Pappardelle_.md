## Description

This dish needs no introduction (but we’ll do one anyway). Authentic ragù alla Bolognese starts with quality meat; beef, pork and bacon, combined to give the dish an incredible depth of flavour. Enhance the richness of the sauce with fresh tomatoes and a splash of milk, true Bolognese-style. Bellissimo!

Once the onion has softened, add the pork & beef ragù mince and cook for 3-4 min further, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the sliced garlic, halved cherry tomatoes and dried oregano and cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes are starting to break down

Dissolve the beef stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>and tomato paste in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water

Stir in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk – this is your stock

### Step 6

Once the Bolognese ragù has been cooking for 5-10 min, add the pappardelle to a pot of boiled water over a high heat with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 10-12 min or until tender with a slight bite (this is known as al denté)

Once done, drain the cooked pappardelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 7

Meanwhile, pick the smaller leaves from the basil and set them aside for garnish

Chop the remaining basil finely, including the stalks

Stir the drained pappardelle and chopped basil through the Bolognese ragù and give everything a good mix up – this is your Bolognese ragù with pappardelle 

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the Bolognese ragù with pappardelle and garnish with the grated Italian hard cheese and reserved basil leaves

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Buon appetito!
