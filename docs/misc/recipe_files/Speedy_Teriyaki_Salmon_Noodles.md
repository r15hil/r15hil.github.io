## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop the remaining red chilli in half lengthways, deseed and chop finely


### Step 2

Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite, then drain reserving a cup of starchy noodle water and return them to the pot until serving


### Step 3

Dissolve the cornflour in a small bowl with 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [5 tbsp] </span>cold water

Stir in the soy sauce, mirin and honey – this is your teriyaki sauce


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chilli (save the rounds for later!) and half of the shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the sliced sugar snap peas and Tenderstem broccoli and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 6

Add the salmon flakes to the pan along with the teriyaki sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened a little


### Step 7

Stir in the drained wholewheat noodles – these are your teriyaki salmon noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the teriyaki salmon noodles topped with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a couple!) and the remaining shichimi togarashi

Enjoy!
