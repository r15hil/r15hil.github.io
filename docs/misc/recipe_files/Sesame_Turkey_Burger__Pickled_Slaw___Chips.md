### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

### Step 3

Add the turkey mince, grated ginger, sliced spring onion, soy sauce and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a very good mix up until fully combined

### Step 4

Divide the turkey mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into burger patties

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds evenly over the burger patties – these are your sesame turkey burgers

Lightly oil a baking tray with vegetable oil and add the sesame turkey burgers, put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine half the sriracha (you'll use the rest later!) with the rice wine vinegar, and a pinch of sugar and salt in a bowl

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the grated carrot and cucumber ribbons to the bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your pickled slaw

### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

### Step 7

Combine the mayo and remaining sriracha in a bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Drain the pickled slaw of any excess liquid

### Step 8

Spread each toasted brioche base with some sriracha mayo, then layer up the sesame turkey burger, pickled slaw, another dollop of sriracha mayo, then top with the toasted brioche lid

Serve the chips and remaining pickled slaw to the side and sprinkle over the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
