### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Combine the grated apple and carrot in a small bowl with the mayo, white wine vinegar and soy sauce – this is your carrot & apple slaw

### Step 4

Pat the pork loin steaks dry with kitchen paper

Cover the steaks in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened to approx. 1cm in thickness

### Step 5

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a shallow bowl

Combine the panko breadcrumbs and shichimi togarashi on separate plate

Coat the flattened steaks in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the vegetable oil and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your breaded steaks

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded pork and cook for 5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tonkatsu

### Step 7

Slice the ciabattas in half

Add the ciabatta halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty

### Step 8

Fill your ciabatta with some of the carrot & apple slaw and a tonkatsu – this is your pork katsu sando

Serve the fries and the remaining carrot & apple slaw to the side

Enjoy!
