## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and peel your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems


### Step 3

Set aside a few basil leaves and mint leaves and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) for garnish


### Step 4

Add your fresh tagliatelle and blanched peas to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until the tagliatelle is cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle & peas, reserve the pot and a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

While the pasta is cooking, add the peeled garlic, pistachio nuts, remaining grated Italian hard cheese, remaining basil, including the stalks, and remaining mint leaves to a food processor

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

Add the juice of half your lemon[s], 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 6

Blitz until you are left with a smooth paste – this is your pistachio pesto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person


### Step 7

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add the drained tagliatelle & peas

Add the pistachio pesto and stir gently until the pasta is coated in the pesto and everything is warmed through– this is your pistachio pesto tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the pistachio pesto tagliatelle with the reserved grated Italian hard cheese on top and a lemon wedge to the side

Garnish with the reserved mint and basil leaves, a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
