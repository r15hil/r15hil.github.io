### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

### Step 3

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped green beans to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 5

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Combine the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger paste, roasted garlic paste, hoisin sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce in a small bowl – this is your fragrant sauce

### Step 6

Add the fragrant sauce to the pan and cook for 30 secs

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1668533557741-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add a small splash of water and cook for a further 4 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, pick your basil leaves from their stems and add to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai-style basil lean pork with green beans

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style basil lean pork with green beans with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
