## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add your sweetcorn cobette[s] to a piece of tin foil with a small knob of butter and wrap up tightly until fully sealed

Put the sweetcorn cobette[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender


### Step 2

Add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the conchiglie and return it to the pot


### Step 3

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks, then add it to a food processor with your flaked almonds, 2/3 of your grated italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>cold water and the juice of half your lemon[s]

Season with a generous pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your basil pesto


### Step 4

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) into your halloumi, making sure to only cut half way through – this is your hasselback halloumi


### Step 5

Add your meat-free patty[ies] to the baking tray and return the tray to the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Stir the basil pesto through the drained conchiglie, then taste for seasoning, adding a pinch of salt or pepper if needed

Sprinkle over the remaining grated italian hard cheese – this is your pesto pasta salad


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the hasselback halloumi and cook for 30 secs on each size or until golden

Once done, transfer to a piece of tin foil and scrunch up the edges around it

Drizzle the honey all over, making sure to get it into all of the cracks


### Step 7

Put the hasselback halloumi in the oven for 5-8 min or until really soft and warmed through – this is your hasselback honey halloumi

Once everything's almost done, slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them to the oven on a separate tray for 3 min or until warmed through

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Spread the warmed brioche base with dollop of your ketchup, then top with a handful of salad leaves, the meat-free patty, a few tomato slices and the warmed brioche lid

Serve with the hasselback honey halloumi, pesto pasta salad, sweetcorn cobette and remaining salad leaves to the side

Drizzle the salad with some olive oil and squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon
