## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and golden


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your coriander seeds and fennel seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and toasted

Once toasted, transfer to a food processor and reserve the pan for later


### Step 3

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughy chop your garlic and chop your green beans in half


### Step 4

Add the chopped shallot, tomato, ginger, garlic and your ground turmeric to the food processor with the seeds

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your spice paste

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the spice paste and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the halved green beans and coconut stock and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency

Once thickened, add the roasted butternut squash cubes – this is your Keralan-style squash curry


### Step 7

Meanwhile, zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s], then cut in half

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Add the lime zest and half of the chopped chilli (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked rice and give it a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli rice

### Step 8

Squeeze the juice of half the zested lime over the Keralan-style squash curry and serve it with the lime & chilli rice to the side

Cut the remaining zested lime into 1 wedge per person

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
