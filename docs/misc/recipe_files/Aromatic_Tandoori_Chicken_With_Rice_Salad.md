### Step 1

Pre-heat the grill to a high heat then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger">[390ml] </span>[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then rinse the rice under cold running water until cool and set aside until serving

### Step 2

Combine your curry powder, half of the natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a very generous pinch of salt in a bowl

Add the chicken strips and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken

### Step 3

Drizzle a baking tray with vegetable oil (to prevent the chicken from sticking)

Add the coated chicken to the tray and put it under the grill for 10-12 min, turning the chicken half way through cooking, until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to char – this is your tandoori chicken

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the remaining natural yoghurt and mayo to a small bowl

Zest your lime[s]

Peel and finely grate (or chop) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), lime zest and a generous pinch of both salt and pepper to the yoghurt – this is your lime & garlic yoghurt

### Step 5

Slice your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon and discard

Slice the cucumber halves finely

### Step 6

Pick your coriander and mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Roughly chop the mint and coriander leaves

### Step 7

Add the rinsed rice, chopped cucumber to a large bowl

Squeeze the juice of the lime[s] into the bowl and season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori chicken over the rice salad

Drizzle the lime & garlic yoghurt all over and garnish with the chopped mint & coriander

Enjoy!
