### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until charred and crispy

### Step 2

While the corn is in the oven, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften and caramelise

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish!)

### Step 4

Once the onion has begun to caramelise, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Add your butternut squash cubes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown

While the butternut squash is cooking, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Combine your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 5

Once the butternut squash has slightly browned, add your ground cumin, dried oregano, bay leaf[ves], half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the drained cannellini beans to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for a further 1-2 min or until everything is coated in the spices

### Step 6

Once everything is coated in the spices, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for an initial 4-5 min

Meanwhile, stack your tortillas, and slice in half

After 4-5 min, add the chopped green beans and chopped basil to the pan and cook, covered, for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the butternut squash is tender – this is your Chilean-style bean & squash stew

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

### Step 7

Remove the cobettes from the oven and set aside to cool, then add the tortilla halves to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining ground smoked paprika

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, then remove from the oven – these are your crispy smoked tortillas

Once slightly cooled, slice the charred corn off the cobettes with a sharp knife

### Step 8

Serve the Chilean-style bean & squash stew in a bowl with the crispy smoked tortillas to the side

Sprinkle the charred corn over the top and garnish with the reserved basil leaves

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
