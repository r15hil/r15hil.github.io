### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Combine half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Gradually add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>milk and mix until fully combined – this is your creamy sauce

### Step 6

Once the bacon lardons are golden, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1717153277390-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add your creamy sauce and blanched peas to the pan, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil

Cook for 30 secs, or until the sauce has slightly thickened, then add your drained tortelloni to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water

Stir it all together and cook for a final 30 secs or until the sauce is coating the pasta – this is your creamy bacon & pea sauce with mushroom tortelloni

### Step 8

Serve the creamy bacon & pea sauce with mushroom tortelloni topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and chopped basil

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
