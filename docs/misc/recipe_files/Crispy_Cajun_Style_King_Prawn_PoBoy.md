## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Raw peeled king prawns (85g) x0
- Raw peeled king prawns (171g)
- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Cayenne pepper (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Ciabatta x2
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Tomato
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Once the chips are cooking, slice your tomato[es] finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and chop in half

Shred half the lettuce finely

Chop the remaining lettuce into wedges


### Step 3

Combine your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a generous pinch of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper in a medium bowl – this is your Cajun-style spice mix

Remove half the spice mix and set aside for later in a small bowl

Add your cornflour to the remaining spice mix and give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced cornflour

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate and add your soy sauce to a small bowl


### Step 4

Drain your king prawns and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Coat the king prawns in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them into the soy sauce and toss to coat evenly

Finally, dip the soy coated king prawns into the spiced cornflour, making sure they are coated all over – these are your coated king prawns


### Step 5

Once the chips are almost done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated king prawns and cook for 4-5 min, turning once halfway, until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy Cajun-style king prawns

Once done, transfer the crispy Cajun-style king prawns to kitchen paper


### Step 6

Add your ciabatta[s] to the tray[s] on top of the chips for a final 4-5 min or until hot and crusty

Once hot, carefully slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half


### Step 7

Add your mayo and half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the reserved spice mix

Mix until fully combined – this is your Cajun-style mayo

### Step 8

Fill the warmed ciabatta with the Cajun-style mayo, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and crispy Cajun-style king prawns

Serve with the chips and a lettuce wedge to the side

Drizzle the lettuce wedge with a little olive oil and the remaining white wine vinegar

Enjoy!
