## Description

The best part about preparing chicken en papillote (meaning in a closed parcel) is that after cooking, you'll add those warm honey mustard juices to your dressing for added flavour. Delicious!

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Boil a kettle

### Step 3

Cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

### Step 4

Cut a piece of tin foil approx. the size of a sheet of A3 paper

Lay the browned chicken in the middle of the foil and pour the reserved honey mustard mixture all over the chicken

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the chicken to form a sealed parcel and place on a baking tray

### Step 5

Place the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your honey mustard chicken

While the chicken is in the oven, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 6

Add the potato wedges to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for an initial 10 min, then add the green beans to the pot and cook for a further 5 min until everything is tender

Once done, drain everything and add your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and the sliced spring onion

### Step 7

Season the potatoes generously with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Wash and pat your baby leaf salad dry with kitchen paper

Transfer the honey mustard chicken to serving plates and reserve the warm honey mustard mixture

Mix the baby leaf salad with half of the warm honey mustard mixture (save the rest for later!) in a bowl

### Step 8

Serve the honey mustard chicken with the remaining honey mustard mixture spooned over

Serve the dressed salad and potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
