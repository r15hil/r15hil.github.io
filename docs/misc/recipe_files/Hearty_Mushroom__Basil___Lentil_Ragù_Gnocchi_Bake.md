## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Grate your chestnut mushrooms


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and your bay leaf[ves] and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Once softened, add the grated mushrooms and cook for 3 min or until tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 4

Once the mushrooms have softened, add your dried oregano, chopped tomatoes, drained green lentils and vegetable stock to the pan

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until the stock has thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your mushroom & lentil ragù


### Step 5

Whilst the ragù is thickening, add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the cooked gnocchi

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the ragù has thickened, wash your spinach, then add it to the pan along with the chopped basil

Cook for 2-3 min further, stirring continuously until the spinach has wilted

Add the cooked gnocchi, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Remove the bay leaf[ves] and discard – this is your hearty mushroom, basil & lentil gnocchi ragù


### Step 7

Transfer the hearty mushroom, basil & lentil gnocchi ragù to an oven-proof dish

Sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your hearty mushroom, basil & lentil gnocchi ragù bake

### Step 8

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the hearty mushroom, basil & lentil ragù gnocchi bake

Enjoy!
