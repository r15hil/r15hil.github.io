### Step 1

Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, preheat the grill to medium-high and boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Add half of the chopped ginger (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl with the miso paste, 1/3 of the toasted sesame oil and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Mix until smooth – this is your miso marinade

### Step 3

Trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop into 1.5cm thick rounds

Add the aubergine rounds to the miso marinade and give them a gentle mix up until fully coated

### Step 4

Line a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil and add the coated aubergine rounds

Drizzle the aubergine with a little vegetable oil, then put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> under the grill and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until tender and starting to char – this is your grilled miso aubergine

### Step 5

Whilst the aubergine is cooking, cut the cucumber in half and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the seeds away, then dice

Add the blanched edamame beans to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them, then run them under cold water until cool

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> as finely as you can

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1635261096162-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Combine the remaining chopped ginger with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, remaining sesame oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your dressing

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1635261099523-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the diced cucumber, cooled edamame beans and sliced shallot to the bowl with the dressing and give it a good mix up – this is your edamame salad

### Step 8

Serve the edamame salad and any remaining dressing from the bowl over the cooked rice

Top with the grilled miso aubergine and sprinkle over the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
