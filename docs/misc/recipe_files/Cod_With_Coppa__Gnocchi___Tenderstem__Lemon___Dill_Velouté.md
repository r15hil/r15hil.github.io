### Step 3

Cook your coppa ham


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat.


Once hot, add the sliced coppa ham and cook for 1 minute on each side or until almost crisp. 


Once crisp, transfer the sliced coppa to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 5 minutes.

### Step 4

Cook your cod 


Meanwhile, return the pan to a medium heat with a large knob of butter.


Pat the cod dry and season with a little salt.


Once the pan is hot, add the cod and cook for 2 minutes on each side or until deeply golden.


Add the cod to the baking<span class="text-highlight"> tray next</span> to the coppa, and put it in the oven for 5 minutes further.


Once done, remove the tray from the oven and leave to rest in a warm place.

### Step 7

Finish the velouté


Add the soft cheese, a generous squeeze of lemon, the chopped dill and chives and a generous grind of black pepper to the sauce. Cook for 1-2 minutes further – this is your lemon &amp; dill velouté.


Add the drained gnocchi, sugar snap peas and Tenderstem to the velouté and give everything a good mix up.

### Step 8

Serve up! 


Serve the sauced gnocchi and vegetables in shallow bowls and top with the cod. 


Place the crispy coppa on top of the cod.


Garnish with a wedge of lemon, the reserved dill leaves and a grind of back pepper.


Enjoy!
