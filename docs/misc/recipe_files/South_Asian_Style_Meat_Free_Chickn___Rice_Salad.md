## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain well and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 3

Combine your gluten free soy sauce and chopped garlic in a bowl with the juice of half your lime[s], your toasted sesame oil, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up – this is your South Asian-style dressing


### Step 4

Combine your meat-free chick'n and your curry powder in a bowl with a pinch of pepper and mix until fully coated – this is your coated meat-free chick'n

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min or until browned and warmed through – this is your curried meat-free chick'n


### Step 5

Once the curried meat-free chick'n has browned, add your roasted peanuts and toasted sesame seeds to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and lightly toasted – this is your curried meat-free chick'n and peanuts & sesame


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Slice the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the tomato wedges, shredded lettuce and carrot ribbons to the pot and gently stir it all together

Add the South Asian-style dressing and chopped coriander and give everything a good mix up – this is your South Asian-style rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the South Asian-style rice salad topped with the curried meat-free chick'n and peanuts & sesame

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
