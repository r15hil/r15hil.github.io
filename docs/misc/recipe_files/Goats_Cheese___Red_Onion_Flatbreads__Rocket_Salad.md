## Description

Goats' cheese and caramelised onion are a classic combo for a reason. However, caramelising onions can take ages when done properly. We've sped up the process for these topped flatbreads by adding onion marmalade to quick-sautéed red onion. Serve alongside a balsamic rocket salad for a stylish veggie supper.
