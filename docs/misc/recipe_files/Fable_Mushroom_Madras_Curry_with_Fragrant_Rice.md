## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water, your bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your fragrant rice


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until browned, breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go – these are your pulled mushrooms


### Step 3

Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and ginger & garlic paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the mushrooms have browned, add the sliced onion with a drizzle of vegetable oil and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 6

Once the onion is starting to soften, reduce the heat to medium

Add your curry powder to the pan with your garam masala, crushed cardamom pods, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomato and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the wilted spinach, give everything a good mix up and cook for a final 30 secs – this is your Fable mushroom madras curry

### Step 8

Serve the Fable mushroom madras curry over the fragrant rice

Season with a pinch of pepper

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods and bay leaf[ves]!

Enjoy!
