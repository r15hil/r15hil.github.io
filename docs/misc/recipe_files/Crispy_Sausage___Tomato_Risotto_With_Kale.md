## Ingredients

- Arborio rice (160g)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Shredded kale (80g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1.4L] </span>boiled water

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add the chopped garlic and arborio rice to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Add your chopped tomatoes and halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your Italian hard cheese

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Heat a separate pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, squeeze your sausage meat from the skins into the pan (clean hands is the best way!) and discard the skins

Break the sausage meat up with a wooden spoon and cook for 6-7 min or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy sausage meat


### Step 7

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the shredded kale to the pan with a small splash of water and stir everything together until wilted

Add a knob of butter, a generous grind of black pepper and half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato risotto

### Step 8

Serve the tomato risotto topped with the crispy sausage meat

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, drizzle with some olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
