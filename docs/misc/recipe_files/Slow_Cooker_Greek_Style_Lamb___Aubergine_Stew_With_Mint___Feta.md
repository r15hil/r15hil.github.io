## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your slow cooker and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Turn on your slow cooker to high


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Add your lamb mince to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 5

Add the contents of your pan to the slow cooker

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, your beef stock mix and tomato paste with your balsamic vinegar, dried basil and the chopped potatoes

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then cover and cook on high for 4 hours (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek-style lamb stew


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once everything is almost done, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the mint sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Crumble your feta, add it to a bowl with the chopped mint and mix together – this is your feta & mint topping

### Step 8

To serve, taste the Greek-style lamb stew for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed, then sprinkle the feta & mint topping all over
