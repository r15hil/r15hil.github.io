## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced beef and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Combine your cornflour with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> boiled water and whisk it all together – this is your cornflour slurry


### Step 4

Once the beef has browned, add the onion wedges and ginger & garlic paste to the pot with a pinch of pepper and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your black bean paste, soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and put the dish in the oven and cook, covered, for an initial 25 min


### Step 5

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

Reboil a kettle

After the beef has had an initial 25 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped pepper and cornflour slurry

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for a further 30 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through – this is your one pot beef in black bean


### Step 7

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

### Step 8

Serve the one pot beef in black bean with the baked rice to the side
