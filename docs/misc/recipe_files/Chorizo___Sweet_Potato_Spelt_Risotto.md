## Description

For a heartier twist on a classic risotto, we've used spelt, an ancient wholegrain that's high in fibre. As well as being quick to prep, this easy one-pot sweet potato risotto is flavoured with chorizo and paprika for a wonderfully rich taste. One-pot luck! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).
