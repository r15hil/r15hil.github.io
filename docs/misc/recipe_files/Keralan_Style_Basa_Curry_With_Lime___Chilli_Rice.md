### Step 1

Boil half a kettle and heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coriander seeds and fennel seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

### Step 2

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and chop them into rough bite-sized pieces

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped basa and cook for 4-5 min or until golden

Once browned, add the ground turmeric and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the cooked basa to a plate, reserve the pan

Roughly chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop the ginger

Peel and roughy chop the garlic

Trim and chop the green beans in half

### Step 4

Add the chopped shallot, tomato, ginger and garlic to the food processor with the seeds

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your spice paste

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1630427084972-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Add the spice paste and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the halved green beans and coconut stock and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency

Once thickened, return the cooked basa to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until warmed through – this is your Keralan-style basa curry

### Step 7

Meanwhile, zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime and then cut in half

Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> half<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> into wedges

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the lime zest and half of the chopped chilli (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked rice and give it a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli rice

### Step 8

Squeeze the juice of the lime half<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> over the Keralan-style basa curry and serve it with the lime & chilli rice and a lime wedge to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
