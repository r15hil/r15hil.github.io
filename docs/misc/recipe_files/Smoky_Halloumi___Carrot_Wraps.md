## Ingredients

- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 225g Cypriot halloumi 
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 50g lambs lettuce
- 2 spring onions
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (26ml)
- 400g carrots 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 350&deg;F/ Gas 4


Top and tail the&nbsp;carrots&nbsp;and cut them into rough, bite-size pieces (no need to peel them!)&nbsp;


### Step 2

Add the carrots&nbsp;to a pot (with a matching lid) of&nbsp;boiled&nbsp;water over a&nbsp;high heat and bring to the boil


Cover and cook for 10-15 min or until they're tender&nbsp;


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim and chop the spring onions&nbsp;finely


### Step 4

Place half of the smoked paprika in a bowl (save the rest for another time!)


Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water&nbsp;and leave for 1 min (the heat helps the flavours of the paprika to develop!)&nbsp;


Add the mayonnaise&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and mix together&nbsp;- this is your smoky mayo


### Step 5

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat


Once hot, toast the cumin seeds for 1-2 min or until they're fragrant, then transfer them to a plate and keep the pan for later&nbsp;


Pat the halloumi dry, and cut it&nbsp;into six slices&nbsp;


### Step 6

Drain the carrots and add them to a food processor&nbsp;


Add a knob of butter and the&nbsp;toasted cumin seeds&nbsp;


Season with pepper


Blitz to a rough texture - this is your spiced carrot&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Add the tortilla wraps&nbsp;to a baking tray and place it in the oven for 2-3 min or until the wraps are warmed through


Tip: don't leave the wraps in the oven for too long or they will go crispy&nbsp;


Return the pan to a high heat and add the sliced&nbsp;halloumi


Cook for 1-2 min on each side or until it's golden brown&nbsp;


Meanwhile, wash and dry the&nbsp;lamb's lettuce&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Fill your wraps like this: spiced carrot, lamb's lettuce, halloumi, smoky mayo and top with the spring onion&nbsp;


Enjoy!
