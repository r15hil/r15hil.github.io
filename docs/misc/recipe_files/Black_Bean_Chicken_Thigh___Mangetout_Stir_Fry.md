- British diced chicken thigh (250g)
- Spring onion
- White long grain rice (130g)
- Cornflour (1tsp)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with the soy sauce and cook for an initial 8-9 min, turning once, until golden


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 4

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop


### Step 5

Combine your black bean paste and Chinese rice wine with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your black bean stock


### Step 6

Once the chicken is golden, add the chopped pepper, garlic, ginger and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your cornflour and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Add the black bean stock and mangetout to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the sauce has begun to thicken and the mangetout has slightly softened – this is your black bean chicken & mangetout stir-fry

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 8

Serve the black bean chicken & mangetout stir-fry with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
