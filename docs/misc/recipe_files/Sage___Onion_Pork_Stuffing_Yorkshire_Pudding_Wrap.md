![Step 1 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-1-1680168092152-x200.jpg)

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then add the pizza base mix to a large bowl

Combine the eggs with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk and 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> cold water in a measuring jug

Whisk the liquid into the flour a little at a time until you end up with a smooth batter, then set aside – this is your Yorkshire pudding batter

Tip: Adding the liquid gradually helps prevent a lumpy batter!

### Step 2

Peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until softened and starting to brown

### Step 3

While the onion is softening, add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a baking tray (or two) and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in the oven for an initial 12 min for the oil to heat up

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into batons

Strip the sage leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 4

Once softened, transfer the cooked onion to a bowl, reserving the pan

Add the sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and chopped sage to the bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and shape them into meatballs – these are your pork stuffing balls

### Step 5

Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add the chopped potato and chopped carrot to the baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the pork stuffing balls to the other side of the baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp and the pork stuffing balls are cooked through (no pink meat!)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1680168110587-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>from the oven and add the Yorkshire pudding batter, then spread it evenly, with a spoon, to the edges of the tray

Tip: Be careful – the oil may splash!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-25 min or until puffed up and golden – this is your Yorkshire pudding

Meanwhile, wash the spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1680168114582-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Gradually add 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, the beef stock mix and onion marmalade and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce begins to thicken to a gravy-like consistency – this is your onion gravy

### Step 8

Cut the Yorkshire pudding into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

To build, fill each cut Yorkshire pudding with spinach, the roast potato & carrots, pork stuffing balls and some of the onion gravy

Fold the Yorkshire pudding around the filling and then cut in half– these are your Yorkshire pudding wraps

Serve the remaining onion gravy to one side for dunking!

Enjoy!
