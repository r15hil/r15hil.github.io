## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until lightly browned


### Step 3

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping


### Step 4

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and sliced shallot to the pan with the chicken

Cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes have started to soften


### Step 6

Once the tomatoes have started to soften, remove the pan from the heat and add the spinach with your sundried tomato pesto, roasted garlic paste and chicken stock mix

Return the pan to the heat, stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, add your crème fraiche with a splash of cold water and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy sundried tomato pesto & chicken sauce


### Step 7

Once crisp, transfer the crispy gnocchi to the creamy sundried tomato pesto & chicken sauce

Stir it all together – this is your creamy sundried tomato pesto & chicken breast gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sundried tomato pesto & chicken breast gnocchi and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
