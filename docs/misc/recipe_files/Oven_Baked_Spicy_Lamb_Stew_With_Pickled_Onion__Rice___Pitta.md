## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s], chop your remaining red onion[s] into wedges

Add your sliced onion to a bowl and set aside for later

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish over a high heat


### Step 3

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Add your red wine vinegar to the bowl with the sliced red onion and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion


### Step 4

Once hot, add your lamb mince to the dish with the onion wedges, crushed garlic and a pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min, breaking the mince into large chunks with a wooden spoon, until very lightly browned

Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Add your chopped tomatoes to the dish with your ras el hanout and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your beef stock mix with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Stir it all together and bring to the boil over a high heat, then put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 40 min or until the sauce has thickened and the lamb has cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your oven-baked spicy lamb stew


### Step 6

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish on one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice


### Step 7

Once the stew and rice are almost done, add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the other side of the tray and cook for a final 3-4 min or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need 2 trays!

### Step 8

To serve, season the oven-baked spicy lamb stew with a pinch of pepper and drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Top with the quick-pickled red onion

Serve with the warmed pitta and baked rice to the side

Dig in!
