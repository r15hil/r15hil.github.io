## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced peppers and cook, covered, for 4-5 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for a further 4-5 min


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 7 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked macaroni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Combine your panko breadcrumbs, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt  – these are your smoky breadcrumbs

Grate your cheddar flavour block


### Step 5

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste, drained macaroni, drained sweetcorn, creamy single soy, vegetable stock mix, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of starchy pasta water, then cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, take the pan off the heat and stir in the grated cheeze, then give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky chipotle mac ‘n’ cheeze


### Step 7

Transfer the smoky chipotle mac 'n' cheeze to an oven-proof dish

Top with the smoky breadcrumbs and put the dish in the oven for 10 min or until bubbling and crispy

### Step 8

Remove the smoky chipotle mac 'n' cheeze from the oven and leave to stand until cooled slightly (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the smoky chipotle mac 'n' cheeze

Enjoy!
