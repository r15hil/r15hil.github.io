### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> butter over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add your curry powder and stir for 30 secs, then transfer the curried butter to a bowl to cool

Wipe the pan clean and reserve it for later

### Step 3

Pat your smoked basa fillet[s] with kitchen paper and add to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Drizzle with olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the smoked basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Reboil half a kettle (you'll only need a little!)

### Step 4

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Wash, your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Stir your mayo and white wine vinegar into the cooled curried butter along with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>boiled water – this is your curried mayo

### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Run the potatoes under cold running water until cool enough to handle, then return to the pot and crush gently

Using a fork, flake the cooked smoked basa into the crushed potatoes, add the chopped spring onion and plenty of salt and pepper then mix gently

Divide the mix into 2 fishcakes per person, then press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> butter

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt, then return the pan to the heat

Cook for 3 min and then add 2-3 tbsp boiled water, cover with a lid, and cook for a further 2 min or until wilted

Once done, transfer the wilted greens to the serving plates

### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the breaded fishcakes and cook on each side for 2-3 min until golden and crispy – these are your smoky fishcakes

Tip: Try not to move the fishcakes in the pan while they cook, so they hold their shape

### Step 8

Serve the smoky fishcakes next to the wilted greens with the curried mayo drizzled all over

Enjoy!
