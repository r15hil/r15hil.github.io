### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Grate the cheddar cheese

Combine half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl with the mayo, white wine vinegar and half the dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your garlic & herb dressing

### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the grated cheese and a drizzle of olive oil and mix together (this will make your breadcrumbs golden!)

Season the chicken breast portions with a generous pinch of salt, then coat them in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

### Step 4

Add the breaded chicken to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden – this is your crispy cheesy chicken

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Add the chopped tomato and shredded lettuce to a bowl with a pinch of pepper and toss – this is your tomato salad

### Step 6

Add the remaining chopped garlic to a medium sized pot with the tomato paste, remaining dried oregano and 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to a boil over a medium heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your marinara sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1696410345530-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer to a clean board and slice each breast into five strips – these are your crispy cheesy chicken fingers

### Step 8

Serve the crispy cheesy chicken fingers with the wedges, tomato salad and marinara sauce to the side

Drizzle the garlic & herb dressing all over the salad

Enjoy!
