### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ 375°F/ Gas 5

Grate the remaining onion

Add the pork & beef ragù mince to a bowl with the grated onion, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and shape them into meatballs


### Step 3

Boil a full kettle

Add the meatballs to a lightly oiled baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until they're browned and cooked through

Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

Top, tail and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic and diced carrot to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 5

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml] </span>boiled water and add the balsamic vinegar, Henderson's Relish and chopped tomatoes – this is your tomato stock

Add the farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and set aside


### Step 6

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the veg has softened, add the tomato stock, spinach, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1tsp]</span> sugar to the pan and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your soup base


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the farfalle to the soup base and tear in the basil

Season with a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your farfalle soup

### Step 8

Serve the cooked meatballs over the farfalle soup

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
