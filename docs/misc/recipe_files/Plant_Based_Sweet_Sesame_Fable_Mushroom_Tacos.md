## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Add your soy sauce to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, agave and a grind of pepper and mix to combine – this is your sweet sesame sauce


### Step 2

Add the sliced onion to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min, stirring often or until golden and crispy then transfer to a small bowl and set aside until serving – these are your crispy breadcrumbs


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 3 min or until starting to brown

Once starting to brown, add the grated ginger and chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to a clean board and shred apart using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the Fable pulled mushrooms to the pan over a high heat and add the sweet sesame sauce (reserve the bowl for later!) and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – these are your sweet sesame Fable mushrooms


### Step 5

Drain the sliced onion in a sieve and under cold running water until cooled

Return them to the bowl and combine with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for later – these are your quick-pickled onions

Wash, then shred your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]


### Step 6

Add the shredded lettuce and grated carrot to the bowl of quick-pickled onions and mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled salad

Add your tortillas to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Add your mayo to the reserved bowl with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> cold water and mix to combine – this is your sriracha mayo

### Step 8

Fill each warmed tortilla with the quick-pickled salad and sweet sesame Fable mushrooms

Top with the sriracha mayo and crispy breadcrumbs

Enjoy!
