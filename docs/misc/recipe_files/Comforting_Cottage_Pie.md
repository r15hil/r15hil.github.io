- Tomato paste (16g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and cut them into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Top, tail, and dice your carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, diced carrot and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your Marmite – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the vegetables have softened, increase the heat to high and add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once the beef has browned, add the tomato stock to the pan

Season with a grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef mixture


### Step 5

While the beef mixture thickens, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a small knob of butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Once the beef mixture has thickened, transfer it to an oven-proof dish

Top with the mashed potato and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your cottage pie


### Step 7

While your cottage pie is cooking, reboil a kettle

Cut your broccoli into florets

Add the broccoli florets to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the cottage pie with the broccoli to the side and enjoy!
