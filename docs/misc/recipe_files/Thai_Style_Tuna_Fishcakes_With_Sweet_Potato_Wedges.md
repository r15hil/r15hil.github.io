### Step 3

Drain the tuna and add it to a large bowl

Add the soy sauce, panko breadcrumbs, chopped coriander, chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and most of the chopped spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) to the bowl

Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>cold water and give it a good mix up then set aside to absorb – this is your Thai-style tuna mix

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the carrot and cucumber ribbons to a large bowl with the rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled carrot & cucumber ribbons
