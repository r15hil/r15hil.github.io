## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 British free-range egg
- 400g potatoes
- 10g fresh tarragon
- 2 ciabatta rolls
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (52ml))
- 250g cooked beetroot
- 80g rolled oats
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges


Add the wedges to a baking tray skin-side down (to prevent sticking) with a drizzle of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper


Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain and grate the beetroot into a sieve (over a bowl), then press and squeeze to release any excess juice (you'll use this later!)


Season the grated beetroot generously with salt and pepper


### Step 3

Chop the tarragon finely, including the stalks


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Combine the grated beetroot, oats, garlic and egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;with half of the chopped&nbsp;tarragon (you'll use the rest later) and mix well to combine thoroughly


### Step 4

Make 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>&nbsp;patties from the burger mix, squeeze them until they hold their shape, then place in the fridge to firm up


Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the red&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1-2 tbsp olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the sliced&nbsp;onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min until the onion has softened slightly


Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the reserved beetroot juice and cook for a further 5 min or until caramelised


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the apple cider vinegar, mayonnaise and the remaining chopped&nbsp;tarragon with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;- this is your&nbsp;herby mayo


Season lightly with salt and pepper


Transfer the cooked, caramelised onions to a plate, reserving the pan for later


### Step 7

Place the ciabatta in the oven for 6-8 min or until hot and crusty


Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 2-3 tbsp olive oil


Once&nbsp;hot, add the beetroot burgers and cook for 4 min on each side or until lightly caramelised and hot through


Tip: try not to fiddle with them in the pan, so they hold together!

### Step 8

Assemble the burgers with some caramelised onion and a little herby&nbsp;mayo on top


Serve with the potato wedges and the remaining herby mayo to the side


Enjoy!
