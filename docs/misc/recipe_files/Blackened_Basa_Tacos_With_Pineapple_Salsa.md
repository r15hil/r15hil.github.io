## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your basa fillet[s] and pour over your soy sauce


### Step 3

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika and ground allspice over the basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through and blackened

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

While the basa is cooking, drain and roughly chop your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 5

Add the chopped pineapple, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander to a bowl and gently mix it all together – this is your speedy pineapple salsa


### Step 6

Once the fish is cooked, break it apart into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and remove from the heat – these are your blackened basa chunks

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

While the tortillas are in the microwave, combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your mayo, a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the blackened basa chunks, speedy pineapple salsa and shredded lettuce

Dollop over the chipotle mayo

Enjoy!
