## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Chop your smoked streaky bacon in half (use scissors for speed!)

Once hot, add the halved bacon to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the bacon is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your baked beans to the pot with your ground smoked paprika, BBQ sauce, pomegranate molasses and a generous grind of black pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to medium


### Step 5

Once the bacon is golden and crisp, add it to the pot and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened – these are your bacon & smoky Boston-style beans


### Step 6

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted


### Step 7

Chop your chives finely

Combine the soured cream and chopped chives in a small bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of pepper – this is your soured cream & chive sauce

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the lettuce into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the bacon & smoky Boston-style beans with the toasted ciabatta and lettuce wedges to the side

Drizzle the soured cream & chive sauce over everything

Enjoy!
