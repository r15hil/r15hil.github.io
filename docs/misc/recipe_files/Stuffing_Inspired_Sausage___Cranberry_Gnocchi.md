## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-9 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!


### Step 3

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash is fork-tender


### Step 5

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 6

Once the sausage meat is beginning to brown, add the sliced shallot and cook for 1 min or until softened

Once softened, reduce the heat to medium-high then add your soft cheese to the pan with your roasted garlic paste, chicken stock mix, dried sage (not a fan of sage? Only add a little!), dried cranberries and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[175ml] </span>cold water

Give everything a good mix up, then bring to the boil and cook for 30 secs or until slightly thickened and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add your butternut squash cubes to the pan with the wilted spinach and crispy gnocchi

Give everything a good mix up – this is your stuffing inspired sausage & cranberry gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the stuffing inspired sausage & cranberry gnocchi

Season with a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
