## Ingredients

- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Ginger & garlic paste (15g)
- Smooth peanut butter (26g)
- Carrot x2
- Spring greens (150g)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned


### Step 2

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium and add a couple splashes of water and cook, covered, for a further 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 3

Add your chilli relish to a small bowl with half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water – this is your chilli dipping sauce


### Step 4

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board, reserve the pan and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add your ginger & garlic paste, peanut butter, the remaining soy sauce and a couple of splashes of water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the peanut butter has loosened – this is your peanut sauce


### Step 5

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with half the grated carrot and half the sliced spring greens (you'll use the rest later!) and a splash of water and give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min or until the veg has started to soften – this is your peanut chicken filling

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 6

Add the warmed tortillas to a clean board and spoon the peanut chicken filling (reserve the pan) evenly between them in the lower half of the tortillas, leaving space around the edges to fold

Fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a tight wrap (like a burrito!)


### Step 7

Add the wraps (seam-side down) to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and drizzle generously with olive oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden – these are your Thai-style peanut chicken baked wraps

While the wraps are cooking, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then once hot, add the remaining sliced spring greens and grated carrot to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened – this is your stir-fried veg

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style peanut chicken baked wraps with the stir-fried veg and chilli dipping sauce to the side

Enjoy!
