## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips


### Step 2

Add the sliced pepper to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the pepper has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely


### Step 4

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 6

Add your pizza bases to a baking tray (or two!)

Divide the pizza sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top the pizzas with the sliced mushrooms, roasted pepper and drained sweetcorn

Sprinkle over your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your spicy pepper & mushroom pizzas
