- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Arborio rice (160g)
- Skin on salmon fillet x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the onion has begun to soften, add your arborio rice and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add them to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)


### Step 5

Add your salmon fillet[s] to the other side of the tray[s], then add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Season the halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of sugar

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Chop your capers and black olives together finely

Combine the chopped capers & olives with the remaining chopped garlic and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your tapenade


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and stir in a knob of butter, half of the tapenade (save the rest for garnish!) and the roasted cherry tomatoes – this is your black olive risotto

### Step 8

Serve the baked salmon over the black olive risotto with the remaining tapenade spooned over – this is your Tuscan-style salmon & black olive risotto

Enjoy!
