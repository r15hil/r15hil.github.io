## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Dice the tomatoes roughly

Roughly chop the chestnut mushrooms


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the pork & beef mince with the chopped chestnut mushrooms, dried oregano and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then cook for 4-5 min or until the mince is starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once the beef has started to brown, add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste and balsamic vinegar to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further, giving everything a good mix up – this is your bolognese sauce


### Step 5

Add the tortiglioni pasta to an oven-proof dish

Pour the bolognese sauce and beef stock over and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Try to make sure that most of the pasta is submerged in the liquid


### Step 6

Cover the dish with tin foil, put it in the oven and cook for 20 min, then remove it from the oven and mix everything together

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry

Return the dish to the oven for 20 min further or until the pasta is cooked and the sauce resembles a ragù-like consistency


### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Once the pasta is cooked, increase the oven temperature to 220ºC/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Remove the dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Top with the grated cheese and return the dish to the oven for a further 5 min, or until the cheese is golden brown – this is your cheesy pork & beef bolognese bake

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy pork & beef bolognese bake with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
