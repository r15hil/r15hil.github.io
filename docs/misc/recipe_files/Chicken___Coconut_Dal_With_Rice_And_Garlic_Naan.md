## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh to the pot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and chicken stock mix in 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Once the chicken is browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the diced carrot to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the carrot has softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and curry powder and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils, coconut stock and a small pinch of salt to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until all the water is absorbed, the lentils are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & coconut dal


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice and a small pinch of salt to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 7

Once the dal is ready, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & coconut dal with the cooked rice and a warmed naan to the side

Season with a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
