## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> [450ml]</span> cold water and your ground turmeric and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your yellow rice


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice half your red onion[s]

Cut the remaining onion into thin wedges

Peel and grate your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, 2/3 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and beginning to caramelise


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Boil half a kettle

Once the onion and garlic has softened, add your ground smoked paprika to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the sliced pepper and onion wedges to the pan with a crack of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, combine your mayo with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), a very small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 6

Once slightly softened, add your tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min, then add 80ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water and reduce the heat to medium

Add your blanched peas, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2 min or until warmed through – this is your spiced veggie mixture


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through your vegetable stock mix

Add the yellow rice to the spiced veggie mixture and mix it all together until fully combined – this is your smoky Spanish-style pepper & pea rice

### Step 8

Serve the smoky Spanish-style pepper & pea rice with the garlic mayo drizzled over the top

Enjoy!
