## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your oven-proof dishes and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the sweet potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Cut the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half, deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into medium-sized chunks

Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


### Step 3

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Add the drained chickpeas to a large baking tray (or two!) with the chopped sweet potato, chopped pepper, onion wedges, the smoked paprika, half<span class="text-danger"> [all]</span> the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining cayenne pepper for another recipe!

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12-15 min or until the sweet potato has begun to soften


### Step 4

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 5

After the initial 12-15 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and top with the cherry tomatoes

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven and cook for a final 10-12 min or until the tomatoes have softened and are starting to brown – this is your spicy patatas bravas traybake
