### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your sweetcorn cobette[s] to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt and scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed

### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes and chopped garlic to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the sweetcorn cobette[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp and the corn is tender

Add your smoked streaky bacon to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min, or until golden and crispy

### Step 3

Whilst everything's cooking, combine half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your dry rub

Season your pork loin steak[s] on both sides with the dry rub

### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your Italian hard cheese finely

Combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and mayo in a bowl with your cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your creamy slaw

### Step 5

Once the bacon is cooked, transfer to a clean board and chop very finely

Combine the chopped bacon in a bowl with the remaining ground smoked paprika and grated Italian hard cheese – this is your crispy bacon crumb

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned steak[s] and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, coat the pork with your BBQ sauce – this is your BBQ pork loin[s]

Transfer the BBQ pork loin[s] to a plate to rest

### Step 7

Once the cobette[s] is cooked, top with a knob of butter and roll in the crispy bacon crumb – this is your crispy bacon corn

Tip: Save any remaining crumb for garnish!

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ pork loin with the garlic potatoes, crispy bacon corn and creamy slaw to the side

Sprinkle over any remaining crispy bacon crumb and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
