### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the quarters so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your plant-based sweet chilli tofu stir fry
