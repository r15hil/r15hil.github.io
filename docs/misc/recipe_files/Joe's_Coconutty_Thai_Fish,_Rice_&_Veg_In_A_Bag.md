## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

### Step 3

Roughly chop the coconut cream and dissolve it in 150ml [250ml] boiled water

Add the soy sauce, Thai green curry paste and kaffir lime leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and stir it all up – this is your Thai curry stock

### Step 4

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper

Line a baking tray with the tin foil sheets (doubling it up prevents any leakages)

Add the mangetout and chopped red pepper to the middle of the foil and give it a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays and make 2 separate parcels!

### Step 5

Top the vegetables with the basa fillets

Sprinkle over the chopped ginger and garlic

### Step 6

Slightly scrunch the edges of the foil around the filling and then add the Thai curry stock

Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the curry to form a sealed parcel

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is cooked

### Step 7

Whilst the parcel is in the oven, add the basmati rice and 250ml [500ml] cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 8

Serve the coconutty Thai fish and veg with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
