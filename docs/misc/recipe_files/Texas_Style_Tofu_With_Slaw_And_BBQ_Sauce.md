## Ingredients

- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 30ml vegan mayonnaise
- 1g smoked sea salt flakes
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 2 ciabattas
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 280g plain tofu
- 30ml tomato ketchup
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 1 orange
- 1/2 cucumber
- 2 garlic cloves
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the cucumber finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a small bowl with the cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Mix everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 2

Remove 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter alternative from the fridge to warm up for later

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Slice the drained tofu lengthways into 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> flat pieces, then score in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way through


### Step 3

Add the soy sauce to a plate then dip the tofu slices into the soy sauce and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray, pouring any remaining soy sauce over the top

Top the tofu slices with the smoked sea salt flakes and 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> generous grinds of black pepper, then put the tray in the oven for an initial 7-8 min

Meanwhile, chop the orange<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half

Peel and grate the garlic


### Step 4

Heat a small pot over a medium heat and add the juice of the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with 25ml <span class="text-danger">[35ml] </span>cold water, the tomato ketchup, Henderson's Relish, ground smoked paprika, half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency, then remove it from the heat and set aside – this is your BBQ sauce


### Step 5

After an initial 7-8 min, remove the tofu from the oven and add a spoonful of the BBQ sauce to each slice (you'll use the rest later!)

Return the tray to the oven for a further 10-12 min or until warmed through and sticky – this is your Texas-style dalmatian tofu


### Step 6

While the tofu is cooking, combine the remaining grated garlic with the warmed<span class="text-danger"> </span>butter alternative and a small pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your garlic butter

Slice the ciabattas in half, then spread the garlic butter over the ciabatta halves (reserve the bowl)

Once the tofu is almost done, add the garlic ciabattas to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until crusty – this is your Texas-style toast


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the shredded red cabbage to the reserved bowl with the mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>of the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber

Season with a small pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together – this is your slaw

### Step 8

Cut the Texas-style toast into triangles

Serve the Texas-style toast slices with the Texas-style dalmatian tofu, slaw and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Add the remaining BBQ sauce to a little pot for dipping

Enjoy!
