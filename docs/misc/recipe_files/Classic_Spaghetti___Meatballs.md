- 11g beef stock mix

- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 190g spaghetti 
- 400g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 carrot
- 250g British beef mince
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the beef mince, panko breadcrumbs and grated Italian hard cheese to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a very good mix up until fully combined

Divide the beef mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> and roll into meatballs


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and finely dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium heat

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Once hot, add the diced carrot and chopped onion with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 5 min or until they begin to soften

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 5

Add the spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti and return it to the pot


### Step 6

While the spaghetti is cooking, dissolve the beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[275ml]</span> boiled water

Once the carrot and onion have softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped tomatoes, beef stock, balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up

Add the browned meatballs and cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Once the meatballs are cooked through, add the drained spaghetti to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the sauce sticks to the pasta – this is your classic spaghetti & meatballs

### Step 8

Serve the classic spaghetti & meatballs in bowls

Top with the grated cheddar and season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
