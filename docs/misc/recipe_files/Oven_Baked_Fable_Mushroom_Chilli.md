### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water then cover tightly with tin foil and put in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms to the dish and cook for 30 secs or until beginning to brown
