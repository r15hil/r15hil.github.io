## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (50ml)
- 2 wholemeal rolls
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 white potatoes
- 1 white wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 4 tbsp cornflour
- 5g dill
- 1 tsp ground turmeric

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice the wholemeal rolls in half

Once the pan's hot, add the sliced rolls, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

Reserve the pan for later


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine the cornflour and ground turmeric with a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your cornflour mixture


### Step 4

Cut the basa fillets into strips

Add the basa strips to the cornflour mixture and stir together until they're fully coated in the mixture


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Chop the dill finely

Combine the mayonnaise with the white wine vinegar, chopped dill and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dill mayo


### Step 7

Remove 4<span class="text-danger"> [8] </span>outer little gem leaves and give them a wash, then set aside for serving

Shred the remaining little gem

### Step 8

Fill your toasted wholemeal rolls with the little gem leaves, dill mayo and crispy fish fingers

Serve the chips and shredded little gem to the side

Drizzle any remaining mayo over the shredded little gem

Enjoy!
