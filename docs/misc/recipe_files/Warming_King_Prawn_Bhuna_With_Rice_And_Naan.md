## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until starting to break down


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes have broken down, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your garam masala, ground fenugreek and ground paprika and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with the tomato stock and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened – this is your warming king prawn bhuna


### Step 7

While the king prawns are cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your mini garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the warming king prawn bhuna with the basmati rice and warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
