## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 160g fine green beans
- 0 fine green beans
- 0 white basmati rice
- 2 tomatoes
- 80g cultured coconut
- 2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 1 ground fenugreek
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 100g basmati rice
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 30g tamarind paste
- 5g coriander
- 1 brown onion
- 100g red lentils

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and roughly slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

While the onion softens, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Trim, then chop your green beans roughly


### Step 3

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your garam masala, ground fenugreek, ground turmeric and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan

Add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a splash more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 4

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under the cold running water

Once fragrant, add the red lentils, vegetable stock and tamarind paste to the pan with the onion

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 5

Add the chopped green beans and tomato to the pan and cook for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until everything is tender – this is your fragrant vegetable sambar

Tip: You may need to add a splash of water if the sambar is looking too thick!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 7

While the rice is cooking, pick your coriander leaves from their stalks and set aside for garnish

Chop your coriander stalks finely

Once cooked, stir the chopped coriander stalks through the fragrant vegetable sambar

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant vegetable sambar with the basmati rice to the side

Dollop over your cultured coconut and garnish with the coriander leaves

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Enjoy!
