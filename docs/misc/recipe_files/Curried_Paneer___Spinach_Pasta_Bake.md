## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 6-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle and set aside

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!


### Step 2

Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate, reserving the pan


### Step 3

Whilst the paneer is browning, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds, then deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) the remaining chilli and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Once fragrant, add your curry powder and 15g <span class="text-purple">[20g] </span><span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min

Gradually add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk, a little at a time, stirring frequently and cook for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your creamy curry sauce


### Step 6

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once smooth, add the tomato stock and spinach and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened and the spinach has wilted


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the cooked pasta, golden paneer and chopped coriander to the sauce, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your curried paneer & spinach pasta

Transfer the curried paneer & spinach pasta to an oven-proof dish and grate your cheddar cheese over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – this is your curried paneer & spinach pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve the curried paneer & spinach pasta bake topped with the sliced chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
