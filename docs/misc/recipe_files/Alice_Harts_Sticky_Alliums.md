Season generously with salt and pepper and roast for 30-40 min or until golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and cut the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into 2cm wedges


Peel and halve the shallots


Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the onion and shallot with a large pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until slightly softened&nbsp;

Add the balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water to the onions


Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cook the onions, covered, for a further 20-25min or until they&rsquo;re sweet and sticky


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the hazelnuts to a small baking dish


Put it in the oven for 7-9 min or until they've darkened slightly in colour and are starting to crack

Chop the parsley (stems too) and the remaining garlic finely

<span class="text-highlight">Tip:</span> Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for serving!


### Step 7

Once the cauliflower is fork tender, blitz the cauliflower and garlic in a food processor with a drizzle of olive oil (and a knob of butter if you&rsquo;re not vegan) until smooth


Taste and season generously with salt and pepper

Serve a generous spoonful of warm cauliflower mash with a spoonful of lentils on top followed by the sticky alliums


Scatter with gremolata and drizzle lightly with olive oil to finish


Enjoy!
