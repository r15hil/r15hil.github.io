Line a baking tray with baking paper, drizzle with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil and add the chickpea kofte patties

### Step 5

While the fries are cooking, finely dice half the cucumber then grate the remaining cucumber

Once the kofte patties are almost done, add the wholemeal pittas to the tray with the sweet potato fries and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Carefully slice in half before serving

### Step 8

Dollop your raita into the pitta pockets then fill with the chickpea kofte patties and a spoonful of mango chutney

Serve the sweet potato fries, cucumber salad and remaining lemon wedges to the side
