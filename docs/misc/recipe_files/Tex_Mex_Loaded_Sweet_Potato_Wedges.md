## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions 
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 90g free-from mayonnaise
- 185g black beans
- 1 chipotle paste sachet (20g)
- 5g chives
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 50g rocket
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the sweet potatoes (skins on) into wedges


### Step 2

Add the sweet potato wedges to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the chives finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped chives and garlic to a bowl along with the mayo and a splash of cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your chive mayo

Add the chipotle paste to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your chipotle dressing


### Step 4

Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely

Add the sliced mushrooms to a bowl with the smoked paprika and a drizzle of olive oil and mix well until the mushrooms are fully coated


### Step 5

Chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters

Drain and rinse the black beans


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to crisp slightly


### Step 7

Once the mushrooms have started to crisp, add the chopped cherry tomatoes and drained black beans to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes are starting to soften – this is your smoky veg

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Stack the sweet potato wedges on the plates, then load them up with the smoky veg

Sprinkle the crispy onions over the top, then drizzle over the chive mayo and chipotle dressing

Garnish with the rocket leaves

Enjoy!
