## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


### Step 2

Once hot, add the sliced onion and leek and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

Meanwhile, slice your chestnut mushrooms and portobello mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the onion and leek has softened, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan with a knob of butter and cook for 6 min or until tender


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is large enough to cover an oven-proof dish


### Step 4

Top, tail, and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a splash of cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the carrot batons to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray, put the tray in the oven and cook for 25 min or until tender


### Step 5

Once the mushrooms are tender, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Combine 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>milk and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water in a measuring jug with your umami seasoning, Marmite and vegetable stock mix – this is your umami stock

Once fragrant, add the umami stock with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 3 min or until thickened – this is your pie mix


### Step 6

Transfer the pie mix to the oven-proof dish (or two!)

Top the pie mix with the rolled pastry and crimp round the edge with a fork

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up and golden – this is your umami portobello & chestnut mushroom pie


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the carrot is tender, flatten out the parcel[s] and top with the spinach and a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the tray to the oven for a final 2 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, remove the tray from the oven and give everything a good mix up – this is your buttered veg

### Step 8

Serve the umami portobello & chestnut mushroom pie with the buttered veg to the side

Enjoy!
