## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh to the dish and cook for 2 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Once the chicken has browned lightly, add your tomato paste, curry powder and ginger & garlic paste

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, sprinkle in your chicken stock mix, add your chopped tomatoes, butter beans, sliced shallot, creamed coconut and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the dish from the oven, add your garam masala with a knob of butter and give everything a stir

Wash your spinach, then add it to the dish

Cover with the lid and return the dish to the oven for 5 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your butter chicken & butter bean curry

### Step 8

Serve the butter chicken & butter bean curry with the baked rice to the side

Dig in!
