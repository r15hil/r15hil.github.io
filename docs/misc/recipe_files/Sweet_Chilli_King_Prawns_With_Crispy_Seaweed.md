## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once the rice is cooked, remove from the heat and lay flat on a plate to cool


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop half your spring onion[s] into batons, then trim and finely slice the remaining spring onion

Combine your cornflour with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water in a bowl

Stir in your red chilli relish – this is your sweet chilli sauce


### Step 4

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to a large baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a large drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until crispy – this is your crispy 'seaweed'


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion, half the chopped garlic and half the chopped ginger (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the cooled rice, soy sauce and toasted sesame oil and cook for 2-3 min or until all of the rice is coated – this is your fried rice

Transfer the fried rice to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


### Step 7

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and remaining chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 min until the pepper has started to soften

Drain, then add your king prawns, spring onion batons and sweet chilli sauce and cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns have cooked through and the sauce is thick and sticky – these are your sweet chilli king prawns

### Step 8

Serve the sweet chilli king prawns over the fried rice with the crispy 'seaweed' to the side

Enjoy!
