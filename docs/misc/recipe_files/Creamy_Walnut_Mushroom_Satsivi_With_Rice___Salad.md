## Instructions


### Step 1

Chop your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Grind the crushed garlic and walnuts in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt to form a rough paste – this is your walnut paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, and the chopped mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until nicely browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Once the mushrooms have browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the walnut paste to the pan with your ground coriander, ground fenugreek (not a fan of fenugreek? Only add a little!) and 2/3 of your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix and creamy single soy to the pan and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened, stirring occasionally


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Combine the sliced shallot with half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Combine the salad and chopped tomato in a large bowl with the quick-pickled shallot and the pickling liquid and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot salad

Once the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat

Add the remaining red wine vinegar to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy walnut mushroom satsivi

### Step 8

Serve the creamy walnut mushroom satsivi with the cooked rice and quick-pickled shallot salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining ground smoked paprika

Enjoy!
