Boil half a kettle

Peel your garlic and roughly tear your basil, including the stalks (reserve a couple of leaves for garnish!)

Add the peeled garlic, torn basil and a large knob of butter to a food processor and pulse until blitzed but not smooth – this is your basil butter

### Step 5

Place the halved cherry tomatoes evenly on top of the orzo, they should sink down under the stock

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 5-6 min

### Step 6

While the orzo is cooking, coat your salmon fillet[s] in the remaining basil butter – this is your garlicky salmon

### Step 7

After an initial 5-6 min, remove the orzo from the oven and top with the garlicky salmon

Add your red wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and put the dish back in the oven to cook for a further 14-15 min or until the stock has been absorbed and the orzo and salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the garlicky salmon with tomato & green butter orzo

Scatter over the reserved basil leaves and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
