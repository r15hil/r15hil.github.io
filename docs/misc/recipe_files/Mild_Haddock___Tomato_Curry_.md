- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp dried dill
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> 


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


### Step 2

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and cover to keep warm


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably <span class="text-highlight">non-stick with a matching lid)</span> with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened but not browning


### Step 4

Once softened, add the korma curry powder, chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the onion and cook for 1 min or until fragrant 


Crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> <span class="text-highlight">Knorr</span> vegetable stock cube and add the chopped tomatoes


Increase the heat to medium and cook for 3 min or until reduced to a curry-like consistency


### Step 5

Once reduced, sit the haddock bites over the sauce 


Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until your haddock is cooked through


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">Your</span> fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Once the haddock is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir the clotted cream through the sauce – this is your mild haddock &amp; tomato curry


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">Stir</span> gently so that your fish doesn't break apart!


### Step 7

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, add a knob of butter and the dried dill and give it a good mix up – this is your buttery dill rice

### Step 8

Serve the mild haddock &amp; tomato curry over the buttery dill rice 


Enjoy!
