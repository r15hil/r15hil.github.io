## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries and chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into quarters

Peel and chop your shallot[s] into quarters

Crush your garlic clove[s] open with the side of a knife and remove the skin[s]

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper, crushed garlic and shallot quarters with a small splash of cold water and cook for 5 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

Once slightly softened, transfer the softened shallot, garlic and half the chopped pepper to a food processor

Reserve the pan with the remaining pepper for later

Add your ground smoked paprika and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the food processor with your tomato paste, white wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a drizzle of olive oil and blitz until smooth – this is your peri-peri sauce


### Step 5

Slice your halloumi in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

Return the reserved pan with the pepper to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced halloumi with 1 tbsp of peri-peri sauce per person (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the halloumi is browned and the reserved pepper is tender – this is your pepper & peri-peri halloumi


### Step 6

Combine your mayo and remaining peri-peri sauce with a grind of black pepper – this is your peri-nnaise


### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the halved brioche to a large baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Wash then remove 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>leaf from the lettuce per person, pat it dry with kitchen paper and set aside

Chop the inner core[s] into quarters, lengthways

### Step 8

To build, layer the toasted brioche base with a lettuce leaf, a wedge of pepper and the peri-peri halloumi

Dollop over the peri-nnaise and top with a toasted brioche lid – this is your peri-peri halloumi burger

Serve the peri-peri halloumi burger with the fries, lettuce wedges, any remaining peri-nnaise and the cooked chicken to the side

Enjoy!
