## Description

A good stir fry should be at the heart of every chef's repertoire. They should be a speedy, simple, one pot (or wok!) wonder that’s bursting with fragrance. This one’s a splendid example; sliced pork is rubbed with coriander seeds and 5-spice, creating warmth, while the shaoxing wine sharpens the flavour.
