### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min<span class="text-danger"> [10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the portobello mushrooms to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Sprinkle half of the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) into the mushrooms – these are your cheesy portobellos

Set the tray aside until later

### Step 4

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice into rounds

Once hot, add the leek rounds to the casserole dish

### Step 5

Add the arborio rice to the dish and stir everything together

Crush the garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Remove the skins and chop the crushed garlic roughly

### Step 6

Tear the chestnut mushrooms directly into the dish

Add the chopped garlic with the Chinese rice wine and white wine vinegar

Add the vegetable stock mix with 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1606305231421-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven

Put the tray with the cheesy portobellos on into the oven at the same time

Cook everything for 25-30 min or until the rice is cooked with a slight bite and the portobellos are tender and juicy

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Stir the remaining grated Italian hard cheese through the risotto and season with a generous pinch of salt

Top the risotto with the cheesy portobellos and a grind of black pepper – this is your oven-baked cheesy portobello mushroom risotto

Serve the oven-baked cheesy portobello mushroom risotto with the rocket to the side

Let everyone dig in!
