## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into thin wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a generous pinch of salt


### Step 2

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the rinsed lentils to the pan[s] with your ground coriander, ground turmeric, garam masala, tomato paste, tamarind paste and ginger & garlic paste

Give everything a good mix up until the lentils are well coated


### Step 3

Once well coated, add your vegetable stock mix with 600ml<span class="text-purple"> [780ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for an initial 10-13 min or until the lentils are almost tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water with the crushed cardamom pods to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant rice


### Step 5

Wash your spinach and shake off any excess water

Slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the rest

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!


### Step 6

Once the lentils are almost tender, add the spinach with the finely chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Drain and add your king prawns

Stir it all together and cook, covered, for a final 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the spinach has wilted – this is your spicy king prawn & lentil dhansak-style curry

### Step 8

Discard the cardamom pods from the fragrant rice

Serve the spicy king prawn & lentil dhansak-style curry with the fragrant rice to the side

Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top with the green chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
