## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into wedges


### Step 2

Add the onion wedges, pepper strips and sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!)

Sprinkle over your ground cumin

Drizzle with vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 3

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika and soy sauce in a bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil – this is your Mexican-style marinade


### Step 4

Add your basa fillet[s] to the Mexican-style marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside for later


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have had 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the marinated basa to the tray[s]


### Step 6

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the basa is cooked through and the vegetables are tender – this is your Mexican-style basa tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your lime[s] into wedges

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style basa tray bake drizzled with your natural yoghurt and a squeeze of lime juice

Garnish with the chopped spring onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
