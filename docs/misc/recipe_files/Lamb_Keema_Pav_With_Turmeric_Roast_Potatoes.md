## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle with vegetable oil, then add your ground turmeric with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until crisp and cooked through – these are your turmeric roast potatoes


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice half your red onion[s]

Slice the remaining red onion as finely as you can

Dice your tomato[es]

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

While the onion softens, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic with your ground cumin, ground coriander and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste to the pan with your chicken stock mix

Increase the heat to high, then add your lamb mince and cook for a further 4-5 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Spoon off any excess fat that may come out of the meat

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Once the lamb mince has browned, add your garam masala to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 5-6 min further or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your lamb keema pav


### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Once done, spread the warmed brioche halves with butter


### Step 7

Add the sliced onion and diced tomato to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato & red onion salad

### Step 8

Serve the lamb keema pav between the buttered brioche halves with the turmeric roast potatoes and tomato & red onion salad to the side

Garnish the lamb keema pav with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
