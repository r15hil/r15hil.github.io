### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200ºC/ 180ºC (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25 min or until the potatoes are golden

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 8-9 min or until softened and caramelised

Once softened, transfer your caramelised onion to a small bowl (reserve the pan!), with your red chilli relish and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your sweet onion chilli relish

### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, add your smoked streaky bacon to a separate baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and crispy

Dice your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

### Step 5

Add your shredded lettuce and diced tomato to a medium bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressed salad

Grate your lighter cheese

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

### Step 6

Once the potatoes have been cooking for 25 min, move them to one side of the tray[s] and add the brioche halves to the other side

Top the brioche base[s] with the grated cheese and put the tray[s] in the oven for a final 5 min or until the brioche halves are crusty and the cheese has melted

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1680172721295-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 8

To build, add a dollop of sweet onion chilli relish to your cheesy brioche base and top with crispy bacon, a fried egg and a brioche lid – this is your gluten free cheesy bacon & egg sandwich

Serve with the crispy spiced potatoes and top with a dollop of remaining sweet onion chilli relish

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
