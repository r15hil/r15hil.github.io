## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a pot (with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add your black mustard seeds and cook for 30 secs, stirring continuously, until fragrant

Add your white long grain rice to the pot with a pinch of salt and stir to fully coat the grains


### Step 2

Add 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Once the onion has started to soften, add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika and cook for 2 min further until fragrant

Once fragrant, roughly tear all your mushrooms into the pan and cook for 4 min until starting to caramelise

Tip: Try not to move the mushrooms around too much as this will stop them from caramelising!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your parsley and chives finely, including the stalks

Crush your walnuts with a rolling pin into small pieces

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have started to brown and caramelise, add your gluten free soy sauce, Henderson's Relish and your creamy single soy and cook for 3 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly

Once thickened add a generous grind of black pepper – this is your 3-mushroom stroganoff

Tip: If you like it more saucy add a splash more water!


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the crushed walnuts and half of the chopped parsley and chives and gently mix it all together – this is your herby walnut rice

### Step 8

Serve the 3-mushroom stroganoff over the herby walnut rice

Sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and chives

Enjoy!
