### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 4

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2 squares per person, then add the vegetable samosa mix to one corner of each pastry square and fold the corner over to make a triangle shape

Crimp the edges with a fork to seal each samosa, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two) and put in the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your vegetable samosas
