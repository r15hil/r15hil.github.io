## Ingredients

- 300g British lamb mince 
- 100g Greek Feta Cheese Cypressa
- 150g pilavlik bulgur
- 1/2 cucumber 
- 120g organic natural yoghurt
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Add the bulgur&nbsp;to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt&nbsp;and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Chop or crumble the feta cheese into small pieces


Add the lamb mince to a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Divide the lamb mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> portions


Divide the feta into 2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[4]</span> portions


Press&nbsp;each portion of lamb mince into the palm of your hand and push the feta into the middle


Seal up the outside with mince to form a sealed meatball


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive&nbsp;oil&nbsp;over a medium heat


Add the lamb meatballs to the pan and cook on each side for 4-5 min or until they're browned all over


Transfer the meatballs&nbsp;to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put them in the oven until you're ready to serve, approx. 10-15 min (keep the pan for later)


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and thinly slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Grate the cucumber&nbsp;and squeeze out any liquid with your hands


### Step 6

Return the pan to a medium heat, keeping any leftover lamb juice


Add the onion&nbsp;and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;and cook 4-5 min or until softened


Once softened, remove the pan from the heat, add&nbsp;the cooked, drained bulgur&nbsp;and mix through - this is your red onion bulgur


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the yoghurt,&nbsp;cucumber, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil and garlic in a mixing bowl


Season with salt and pepper - this is your tzatziki&nbsp;

Spoon the tzatziki over the red onion&nbsp;bulgur


Place the cooked giant meatballs on top


Enjoy!
