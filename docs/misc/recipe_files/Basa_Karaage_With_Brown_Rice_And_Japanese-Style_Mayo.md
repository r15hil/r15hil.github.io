### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot (with a matching lid) with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your basa fillet[s] into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) half of your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) finely

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi white bases, toasted sesame seeds and sliced garlic with a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the pak choi has started to soften, then add the pak choi green tops and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the cooked pak choi to a plate and reserve the pan for later

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your cornflour to a large bowl

Add the marinated basa, leaving most of the marinade behind

Give everything a good mix up so the basa pieces are fully coated in cornflour

### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat with enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned – this is your basa karaage

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the basa karaage next to the brown rice and pak choi with the Japanese-style mayo as a dipping sauce on the side

Enjoy!
