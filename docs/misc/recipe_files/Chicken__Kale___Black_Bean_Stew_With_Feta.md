## Description

"Mexican food isn't always healthy, but this spicy stew is an absolute winner. It's protein packed from lean chicken breast, and the giant couscous and fibre-rich black beans make it super filling. Leafy green kale gives a bit of extra goodness! Serve with a sprinkling of feta and fresh coriander."

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle 


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 2-3 min on each side, or until browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span><span class="text-highlight"> Knorr</span> chicken stock cube in 650ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once browned, add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper<span class="text-highlight"> (can't</span> handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and tomato paste 


Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

<span class="text-highlight">When fragrant, add</span> the chicken stock and giant couscous and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the couscous is tender


### Step 5

Meanwhile, shred the chicken apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'


### Step 7

Once everything is cooked, squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and give it a good mix up – this is your black bean &amp; kale stew
