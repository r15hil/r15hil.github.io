## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 160g arborio rice
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 160g blanched peas
- 5g fresh chives
- 2 x 100g smoked basa fillets
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 3 spring onions
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Trim, then chop the spring onions into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion and cook for 2-3 min or until it's softened slightly


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once the spring onion has softened, add the arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in oil


### Step 5

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Reboil a kettle


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut the smoked basa fillets into bite-sized pieces

Grate the cheddar cheese

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the blanched peas, grated cheese and chopped smoked basa to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until the fish is cooked through and the peas are tender – this is your smoked basa & pea risotto

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, chop the chives finely


### Step 7

Bring a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Crack the eggs gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel and season them with salt and pepper – these are your poached eggs

### Step 8

Serve the poached egg over the smoked basa & pea risotto

Garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!
