## Ingredients

- Dried sage (1tsp) x1
- Spinach (80g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (90g)
- Smoked streaky bacon (45g) x0
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- British free range egg x2
- Cranberry sauce (40g)
- Tomato ketchup (30ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a large baking paper-lined baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil, your dried sage and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until the potatoes are starting to soften


### Step 3

Once the potatoes are starting to soften, move the potatoes to one side and add your smoked streaky bacon to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 9-10 min or until the bacon is lightly golden


### Step 4

Whilst the bacon is cooking, combine your tomato ketchup with your cranberry sauce in a small bowl – this is your cranberry ketchup

Boil a full kettle


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are tender and the bacon is lightly golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven, carefully push the potatoes to one side and crack your egg[s] on to the tray[s]

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

Add your brioche bun[s] on top of the potatoes


### Step 6

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-5 min or until the egg is done to your liking, the bacon is crisp and golden and the brioche is warmed through


### Step 7

While everything is in the oven, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Drain the spinach and squeeze any excess water out with the back of a spoon (this will stop your brioche bun[s] from going soggy!)

### Step 8

To build your bun, top each warmed brioche base with some wilted spinach, smoked streaky bacon and an egg

Add a drizzle of cranberry ketchup and top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your one tray bacon & egg brunch bun with cranberry ketchup

Serve with the sage potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
