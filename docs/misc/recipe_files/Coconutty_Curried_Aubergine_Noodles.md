## Instructions


### Step 1

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly charred


### Step 3

While the aubergine is cooking, peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges, so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Once the aubergine is lightly charred, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the onion petals with a little drizzle of vegetable oil and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour with your ground turmeric, curry powder and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, combine 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[350ml]</span> boiled water with your soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 6-7 min or until the aubergine is tender and the sauce has thickened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle

Add your medium egg noodles to a bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> starchy noodle water


### Step 7

Once the aubergine is tender, add your cultured coconut and rice vinegar to the pan and stir everything together

Add the drained noodles with the reserved starchy noodle water

Mix everything together until the noodles are fully coated and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – these are your coconutty curried aubergine noodles

### Step 8

Serve the coconutty curried aubergine noodles 

Enjoy!
