### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms directly into the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

### Step 4

Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled slaw

### Step 5

Once the mushrooms have softened, add your pho broth paste to the pan

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant and most of the liquid has evaporated – these are your Vietnamese-style mushrooms

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s] and add to a plate

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1705335278310-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are tender, add a small drizzle of olive oil and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy potatoes

Pop your hot dog bun[s] in the microwave for 30 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build, fill the warmed hot dog bun[s] with the Vietnamese-style mushrooms and top with a little quick-pickled slaw, sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), mayo and crispy fried onions – this is your Vietnamese-style mushroom bánh mì

Serve the spicy potatoes and remaining quick-pickled slaw to the side, then with scissors, chop your coriander roughly over the bánh mì and potatoes

Enjoy!
