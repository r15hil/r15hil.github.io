## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coriander seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the coriander seeds to a pestle & mortar and crush roughly

Reserve the pan


### Step 3

Cut your basa fillet[s] into small bite-sized pieces and pat dry with kitchen paper

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the basa pieces with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

While the fish is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Once cooked, transfer the basa to a plate, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the sliced onion to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 5

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, peanut butter and chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[595ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and crushed coriander seeds to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Increase the heat to medium, add your cherry tomatoes and coconut stock and cook for 7-9 min or until thickened


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!)

Add the cooked basa and chopped coriander to the sauce and cook for 1 min further – this is your Brazilian-style basa & coriander curry

Cut your lime[s] into wedges

Add the juice of half the lime wedges to the curry (save the rest for garnish!)

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style basa<span class="text-danger"> </span>& coriander curry with the brown rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
