## Ingredients

- 0 British diced chicken breast
- 1 chicken stock mix
- 1 chicken stock mix
- 120g spinach
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 0 white basmati rice
- 1 tomato
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 130g basmati rice
- 0 ground turmeric
- 1 carrot
- 3 cardamom pods
- 250g British diced chicken breast
- 0 spinach

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, crushed cardamom pods and your ground turmeric with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, then add your saffron – this is your saffron chicken stock


### Step 4

Chop your tomato[s] roughly

Increase the heat to high and add your diced chicken breast and chopped tomato to the pan

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken is browned


### Step 5

Once the chicken is browned, reduce the heat to medium, then stir your basmati rice and sultanas into the pan

Add your saffron chicken stock to the pan, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>and natural yoghurt in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your garlic yoghurt

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash, then chop your spinach roughly


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir the grated carrot[s] in and cook for a further 1 min or until warmed through and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the chopped spinach to the pan and stir until wilted – this is your saffron & spinach chicken pilaf

### Step 8

Serve the saffron & spinach chicken pilaf (discard the cardamom pods!) with a dollop of garlic yoghurt

Enjoy!
