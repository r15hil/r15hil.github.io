## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and add to a large bowl with your curry powder, half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your chicken thighs and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated, then refrigerate until later


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic with the side of a knife, keeping the skins on


### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes and red onion wedges to a large roasting tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Sprinkle over your ground turmeric and yellow mustard seeds

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together


### Step 4

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Squeeze half the lemon wedges over the potatoes and onion wedges then add the squeezed wedges to the tray[s] (save the remaining wedges for garnish)


### Step 5

Add the crushed garlic to the tray[s], along with the marinated chicken and any remaining marinade from the bowl with the chicken

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 30 min


### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once everything has been cooking for 30 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, push the chicken to one side then add the spinach

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indian-style spiced chicken


### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Once everything is cooked, remove the Indian-style spiced chicken from the tray[s] and stir the wilted spinach through the potatoes and onion wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style spiced chicken with the potato, spinach & onion wedges to the side

Dollop with the remaining natural yoghurt

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), nigella seeds and lemon wedges

Enjoy!
