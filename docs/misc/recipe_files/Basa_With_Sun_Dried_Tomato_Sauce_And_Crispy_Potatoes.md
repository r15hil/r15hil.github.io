## Ingredients

- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- Spring onion
- Basa fillet x0
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Garlic clove x3
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Rosemary (5g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife (skins on!)

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and discard the stems


### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with the crushed garlic and rosemary leaves

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, drizzle with vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the potatoes are beginning to soften

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 4

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, add the basa fillet[s] to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the potatoes are crisp

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim then add the green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot and cover until serving


### Step 6

While the beans are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1 min


### Step 7

Stir in your soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your sun-dried tomato sauce

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the basa fillet over the sun-dried tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes, roasted garlic and green beans to the side

Enjoy!
