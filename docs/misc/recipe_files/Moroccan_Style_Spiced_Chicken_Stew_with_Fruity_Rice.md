## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return to the pot and add your diced apricots and sultanas and stir it all together, then keep covered until serving – this is your fruity rice


### Step 2

Cut your sweet pointed pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large pieces

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals, then crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper (skin side down) to the pan with the onion petals and peeled garlic

Cook, covered, for 6-7 min or until slightly softened and charred


### Step 4

Meanwhile, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop roughly

Chop your tomato[es] roughly


### Step 5

Transfer the charred pepper, onion and garlic to the food processor and blitz until finely chopped (reserve the pan)

Add your ras el hanout to the blitzed vegetables with your tomato paste, chicken stock mix, a pinch of sugar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Whizz until smooth – this is your spiced pepper sauce


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for an initial 7-8 min or until the chicken is almost cooked and browned all over


### Step 7

Once the chicken is browned, add the spiced pepper sauce with the chopped tomato, a pinch of salt and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[90ml] </span>cold water

Cook for a final 3-4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) then stir through the wilted spinach – this is your Moroccan-style spiced chicken stew

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve your Moroccan-style spiced chicken stew with the fruity rice to the side

Crumble your Greek cheese over the top

Drizzle with your harissa paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
