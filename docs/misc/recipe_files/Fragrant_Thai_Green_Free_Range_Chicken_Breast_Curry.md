## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your lemongrass, basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min

Once the shallot has softened, add the chopped chicken and cook for 5-7 min or until starting to brown


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon), then peel your garlic

Slice your red chilli[es] in half and scrape the seeds out with a spoon, and chop your coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Add the ginger, garlic, half of the red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span>[4 tbsp] </span>water and blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry paste


### Step 5

Add the Thai green curry paste to the pan with the chicken and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water, add your fish sauce with your lime leaf[ves], the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your fragrant stock


### Step 6

Add the chopped green beans and fragrant stock to the pan and cook for 4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your fragrant Thai green free range chicken curry

Tip: Add an extra splash of water if the sauce thickens too quickly!


### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Slice the remaining chilli finely

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant Thai green free range chicken curry over the lemongrass rice

Garnish with the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
