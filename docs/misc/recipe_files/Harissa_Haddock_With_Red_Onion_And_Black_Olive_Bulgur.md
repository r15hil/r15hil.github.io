## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Add your haddock bites to a bowl with your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil and give everything a good mix up then keep to one side â€“ this is your harissa-marinated haddock


### Step 2

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Peel and finely slice your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a pot (with a matching lid) over a medium-low heat with a knob of butter

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced garlic and ground cumin with your bulgur wheat and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water and your soy sauce to the bulgur wheat and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook, covered, for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add to a bowl with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Roughly chop your black olives


### Step 6

Once the onion wedges start to soften, add the harissa-marinated haddock with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Once the bulgur wheat is cooked, stir through the chopped black olives

### Step 8

Serve the harissa haddock and red onion wedges over the black olive bulgur with the salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
