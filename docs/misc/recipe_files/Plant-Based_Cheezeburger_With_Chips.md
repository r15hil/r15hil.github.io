### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your cucumber into rounds

### Step 3

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove the outer leaves and set aside for later, then finely shred the inner core

### Step 4

Add your meat-free burger patties to one side of a non-stick baking paper-lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

### Step 5

While the patties are in the oven, add your mayo to a bowl with your chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then stir through your white wine vinegar – this is your burger sauce

### Step 6

Once the patties are cooked, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice – these are your cheezy meat-free patties

Slice your brioche buns in half and add them to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese flavour slice has melted and the plant-based brioche is warmed through

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the shredded lettuce to a bowl with half of the burger sauce (save the rest for later!) and give it a good mix up – this is your lettuce slaw

### Step 8

Fill each warmed brioche bun with a spoonful of lettuce slaw, a cheezy meat-free patty and the cucumber rounds – these are your plant-based cheezeburgers

Serve the chips, remaining lettuce leaves and remaining burger sauce to the side

Drizzle the lettuce leaves with olive oil

Enjoy!
