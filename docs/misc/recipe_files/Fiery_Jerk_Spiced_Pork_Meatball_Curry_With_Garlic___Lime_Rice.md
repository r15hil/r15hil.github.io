## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 2

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) in a bowl with half your jerk paste, half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Divide the mince and shape them into meatballs (3 per person!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Reserve the pan


### Step 4

Return the pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the chopped shallot and sliced pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add 2/3 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and the chopped ginger to the pan with your curry powder and ground turmeric

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 5

Once fragrant, return the browned meatballs to the pan with the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a pot with a matching lid over a medium heat, add a knob of butter and once melted, add the remaining chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water to the pot, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 7

Whilst the rice is cooking, roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Once cooked, add the juice of half the lime into the rice and mix to combine – this is your garlic & lime rice

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Once the meatballs are cooked, mix half your cultured coconut through the sauce – this is your fiery jerk-spiced pork meatball curry

### Step 8

Serve the fiery jerk-spiced pork meatball curry with the garlic & lime rice to the side

Dollop over the remaining cultured coconut and remaining jerk paste

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
