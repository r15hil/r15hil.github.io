### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into wedges

Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Add 20g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[35g]</span> butter to a bowl and microwave for 10 secs or until melted

Add your toasted sesame seeds to the bowl with your honey and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and stir it all together – this is your sesame butter mix

### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in quarters

### Step 4

After an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, then add the chopped pepper and drizzle over half the sesame butter mix (you'll use the rest later!)

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a further 10-15 min or until the sweet potatoes are golden and cooked through and the pepper is tender – these are your sticky wedges & roasted pepper

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and a small splash of cold water to the remaining sesame butter mix

### Step 5

While everything's in the oven, add the remaining soy sauce to a plate with your salmon fillet[s]

Turn the salmon fillet[s] several times until the soy sauce fully soaks into the fish

Sprinkle your cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the salmon until fully coated – this is your coated salmon

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1727182444705-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coated salmon and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your crispy soy salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1727182451452-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the crispy soy salmon to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the sesame butter mix to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until it starts to thicken

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and add the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your sesame, honey & lime sauce

Tip: Not sure about citrus? Try using less!

### Step 8

Serve the crispy soy salmon with the sticky wedges & roasted pepper to the side

Drizzle over the sesame, honey & lime sauce

Garnish with the chopped coriander, sliced spring onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
