### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and grate half the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Finely dice the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 2

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Combine the grated onion and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a large bowl with the dried oregano, pork & beef mince and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> and shape them into meatballs

### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs and diced onion to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned and the onion has softened

### Step 5

Once the meatballs are browned, add the remaining chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and beef stock mix with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your meatballs & tomato sauce

### Step 6

While the meatballs are cooking, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open them out like a book

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1691681152308-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer the meatballs to the sliced rolls with a drizzle of the tomato sauce and top with the torn mozzarella – these are your subs

Remove the baking tray from the oven and push the fries to one side, then add the subs and return the tray to the oven for a final 5 min or until the mozzarella has melted – these are your pork & beef meatball subs

Return the pan with tomato sauce to a medium-high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your marinara dip

### Step 8

Serve the pork & beef meatball sub and season with a good grind of pepper

Serve the marinara dip and fries to the side

Tip: For the New York sub experience wrap your sub in tin foil or baking paper, it will soften the bread!

Enjoy!
