### Step 1

Chop the tomatoes into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tomatoes and butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min<span class="text-danger"> [7-9 min] </span>or until the squash cubes are fork-tender and the tomatoes have softened

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter alternative

Once melted, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir with a wooden spoon for 3-4 min or until a paste forms – this is your roux

### Step 4

Dissolve the tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Gradually whisk the chipotle stock into the onions, a little at a time, and cook for 2-3 min (stirring occasionally) or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your chipotle sauce

### Step 5

While the sauce is cooking, grate the cheddar flavour block

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drain and rinse the black beans

### Step 6

Once the chipotle sauce has thickened, transfer 1/3 to the measuring jug – this is your enchilada topping

Add the drained black beans, cooked butternut squash & tomatoes, ground cumin and dried oregano to the remaining sauce in the pan and cook for a final 1-2 min or until thick – this is your butternut squash & black bean filling

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little vegetable oil

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1682596207017-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Divide the butternut squash & black bean filling between the tortillas, roll each tortilla up and place them in the oven-proof dish, seam side down

Top with the enchilada topping (add a splash of water if needed to loosen to a spoonable consistency) and the grated cheeze

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tortillas are crispy – these are your chipotle squash & bean enchiladas

### Step 8

Serve the chipotle squash & bean enchiladas garnished with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
