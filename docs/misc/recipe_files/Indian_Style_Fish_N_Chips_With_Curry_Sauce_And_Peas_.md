## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potato[es] and sweet potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut the lime[s] into wedges

Add your basa fillet[s] to a large bowl with a squeeze of lime<span class="text-danger"> </span>juice, the lime zest, nigella seeds, ground turmeric, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt – these are your marinated basa fillets


### Step 3

Place the marinated basa fillets on a separate tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Indian-style fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (don't chop!) your ginger

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, cornflour and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> milk and whisk well – this is your cornflour mix


### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your blanched peas, chopped creamed coconut, a small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt to a large heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top


### Step 6

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 2-3 min or until the peas are hot

Once hot, mash the peas with a squeeze of<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime juice until they come together nicely – these are your coconut mushy peas

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated ginger, grated garlic and curry powder and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cornflour mix and cook for 2-3 min or until reduced and glossy – this is your chip shop curry sauce

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style fish with the chips, coconut mushy peas and a little bowl of chip shop curry sauce to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
