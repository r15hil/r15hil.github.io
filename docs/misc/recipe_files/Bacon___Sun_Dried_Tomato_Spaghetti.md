## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Once the lardons are golden, add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 2 min or until starting to soften


### Step 5

Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Once the tomatoes have softened, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your sun-dried tomato paste and finely chopped tomatoes to the pan with your chicken stock mix and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your bacon & sun-dried tomato sauce


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the drained spaghetti to the bacon & sun-dried tomato sauce and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated – this is your bacon & sun-dried tomato spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the bacon & sun-dried tomato spaghetti topped with the salad

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese all over

Enjoy!
