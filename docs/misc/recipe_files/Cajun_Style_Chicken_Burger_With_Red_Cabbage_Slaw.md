### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 3

Combine your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper and a very large pinch of salt on a plate – this is your Cajun-style seasoning

### Step 4

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to the Cajun-style seasoning and turn several times until fully coated in the spices

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the Cajun-style chicken and cook for 9 min on each side pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add your shredded red cabbage, grated carrot and half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your red cabbage slaw

Combine your mayo and red chilli relish in a small bowl – this is your chilli mayo

### Step 7

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy

### Step 8

To serve, spread the warmed ciabatta with the chilli mayo and top with the Cajun-style chicken and some of the red cabbage slaw

Serve the chips and remaining red cabbage slaw to the side and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
