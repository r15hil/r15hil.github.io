### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Roughly chop the chestnut mushrooms, then peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and garlic and cook for 3 min or until the mushrooms have started to soften

### Step 2

Meanwhile, drain the tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop roughly

Add the chopped tofu to a bowl with the softened mushrooms, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a very generous pinch of salt

Blitz with a stick blender until a rough paste forms – this is your tofu mix

### Step 3

Roll the tofu mix into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> balls (clean hands are the best way!)

Add the tofu balls to a lightly oiled baking tray

Brush each tofu ball with vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until lightly golden and crisp

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

### Step 4

Wash the spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 5

Add the wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the soy sauce and agave with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water and cook for 3 min or until the sauce thickens slightly

Once thickened, transfer to a small bowl – this is your sticky soy sauce

### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 2 min

Add the drained noodles, grated carrot, toasted sesame oil and the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> on a hard surface to release more juice!

Season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your vegetable noodle stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the tofu balls over the vegetable noodle stir-fry and drizzle over the sticky soy sauce

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
