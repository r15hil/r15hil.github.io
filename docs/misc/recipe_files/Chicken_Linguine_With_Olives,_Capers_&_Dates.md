### Step 4

Drain the softened dates and spread them over the chicken thighs

Give everything a good mix up

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your olive, caper & date chicken

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 6

Once the chicken has had 10 min in the oven, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine and return to the pot

### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the chicken thighs to a clean board and shred them apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Remove and discard the bay leaves

Return the shredded chicken to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Stir the olive, caper & date sauce and most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) through the cooked linguine

### Step 8

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the chicken linguine with olives, capers & dates with the rocket to the side

Drizzle the rocket with a little olive oil

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
