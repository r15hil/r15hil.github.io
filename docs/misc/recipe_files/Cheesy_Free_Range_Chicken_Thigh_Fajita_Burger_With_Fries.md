### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Transfer the browned chicken to one side of a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min, reserve the pan

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced pepper, sliced onion, ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

Once softened, remove from the heat and set aside – this is your fajita spiced onion & pepper

### Step 5

Grate your cheddar cheese

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Cut half the lime[s] into wedges

### Step 6

After the chicken has had an initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and divide the grated cheese equally over the top of each chicken thigh

Slice your brioche style bun[s] in half, then add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return it to the oven for 2-3 min until the cheese has melted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use two trays!

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the remaining ground smoked paprika to a bowl with your mayo and the juice of half the lime[s] – this is your paprika mayo

### Step 8

Spread a dollop of paprika mayo over each brioche base, then top with the cheesy chicken thighs, fajita spiced onion & pepper and a brioche lid – this is your cheesy free range chicken fajita burger

Serve the fries and remaining paprika mayo to the side and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
