## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your flat white mushroom[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min, then increase the heat to medium-high, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for a further 5-7 min


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

While the mushrooms are cooking, peel and chop your potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them in a colander and shake them until they're fluffy


### Step 3

Meanwhile, roughly chop your pistachios

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Add the drained lentils, dried cranberries, chopped pistachios, panko breadcrumbs, half your dried sage and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to the onion and mushroom pan

Give everything a good mix up then roughly mash – this is your pistachio nut roast mixture


### Step 4

Line a loaf tin (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and grease with vegetable oil

Add the pistachio nut roast mixture to the prepared tin, reserving the pan

Press down the mix into the corners and smooth out the top with a spatula, then put the tin in the oven for 35-40 min or until golden and firm in the middle – this is your pistachio nut roast

Tip: No loaf tin? Shape into a log instead!


### Step 5

Top, tail and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways (no need to peel!), then trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] in quarters lengthways

Wipe out the reserved pan and return to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the remaining dried sage with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant – this is your sage oil


### Step 6

Add the cooked potatoes to one side of a baking tray (or two!) and drizzle over the sage oil (reserve the pan)

Add the chopped parsnip and carrot to the other side of the tray[s] with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min

After 15 min, add the Brussels sprouts to the tray[s] with a knob of butter and return to the oven for a further 15 min or until the potatoes are crispy – these are your sage roast potatoes and roasted vegetables


### Step 7

Boil half a kettle and return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the remaining sliced onion with a knob of butter and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then stir in 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water to the pan with your Henderson's Relish, vegetable stock mix, the remaining soy sauce and a generous grind of black pepper, then cook for 7-9 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy

### Step 8

Gently turn the pistachio nut roast out onto a chopping board, let it cool slightly, then cut into thick slices

Serve the sliced pistachio nut roast with the roasted vegetables and sage roast potatoes to the side

Drizzle over the onion gravy

Enjoy!
