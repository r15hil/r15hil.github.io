## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 0 British lamb mince
- 250g British lamb mince
- 1 chicken stock mix
- 1 chicken stock mix
- 16g tomato paste
- 120g spinach
- 0 white basmati rice
- 1 tomato
- 2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 2 garlic & coriander naans
- 1 ground fenugreek
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 100g basmati rice
- 0 spinach
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add your nigella seeds and basmati rice and cook for 1 min or until fragrant and lightly toasted


### Step 2

Once toasted, add 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [320ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

When the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Remove the rice from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your nigella rice


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 7-10 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Reboil a kettle

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the cooled spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, turn the heat up to high, then add your lamb mince, garam masala, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground fenugreek to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Add the tomato wedges, chopped spinach and tomato stock and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lamb keema saag


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your mini garlic & coriander naan[s] to toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the lamb keema saag with the nigella rice and warmed naan to the side

Enjoy!
