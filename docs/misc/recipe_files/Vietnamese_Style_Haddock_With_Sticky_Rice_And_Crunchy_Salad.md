## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (don't chop!) your ginger


### Step 4

Combine your soy sauce with the juice of your lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated garlic and grated ginger in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your Vietnamese-style marinade


### Step 5

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Chop your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and finely slice them, discard the stems


### Step 6

Combine the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced cucumber and carrot ribbons in a large bowl along with half of your Vietnamese-style marinade and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Add your haddock bites to the remaining Vietnamese-style marinade and mix to combine (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated haddock along with any remaining marinade from the bowl and cook for 5 min turning half way or until cooked through – this is your Vietnamese-style haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Vietnamese-style haddock with the sticky rice and the crunchy salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds and chopped mint

Enjoy!
