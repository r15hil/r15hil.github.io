### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced peppers, diced chorizo and a pinch of pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the peppers are starting to soften

### Step 4

Peel and chop (or grate!) your garlic

Once the peppers have softened, add your ground smoked paprika and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!

### Step 6

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>of boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once fragrant, add the cooked rice with your black olives, the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and the tomato stock and stir it all together

Cook for 2-3 min further or until everything is warmed through – this is your one pot chorizo, mixed pepper & tomato rice

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1700036019916-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the one pot chorizo, mixed pepper & tomato rice garnished with the chopped parsley and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
