### Step 1

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, combine the miso paste, gochujang paste, toasted sesame oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your samjang

### Step 7

Once done, transfer the crispy pork belly strips to kitchen paper and remove the pan from the heat

Add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until golden

Tip: The pan should be hot enough to cook the garlic in already!

Slice the pork belly strips into small bite-sized pieces

### Step 8

Serve the lettuce leaves, sticky rice, crispy pork belly strips, samjang, garlic and sliced spring onion in the middle of the table to serve

To eat, spread a lettuce leaf with some samjang and top with a spoonful of cooked rice, crispy pork belly, sliced garlic and spring onion

Fold them up into a wrap and enjoy!
