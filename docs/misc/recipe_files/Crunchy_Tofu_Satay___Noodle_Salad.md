### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and cut into thin wedges, lengthways

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened slightly

### Step 3

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into strips

Coat the tofu in your curry powder

Once softened, transfer the pepper and onion to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat (no need to clean!)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles and return to the large bowl

### Step 6

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add the chopped creamed coconut and your peanut butter to a bowl and add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Whisk everything together until you have a smooth paste

Stir your soy sauce, red chilli relish and chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) into the paste â€“ this is your satay dressing

### Step 7

Add the lettuce wedges, cooked pepper and onion to the bowl with the drained noodles

Give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the easiest way!)

### Step 8

Serve the curried tofu strips over the noodle salad

Drizzle the satay dressing over the top

Enjoy!
