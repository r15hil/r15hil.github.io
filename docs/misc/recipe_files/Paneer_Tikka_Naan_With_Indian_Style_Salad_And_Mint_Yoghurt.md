## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started! 

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine 1/4 of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) in a bowl with your ground turmeric, ground paprika, garam masala, ginger paste, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and the a squeeze of lemon juice – this is your tikka marinade


### Step 3

Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Add the chopped paneer to the tikka marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the marinated paneer and cook for 3-5 min or until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring – this is your paneer tikka


### Step 4

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Boil a kettle


### Step 5

While everything's cooking, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then chop roughly

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Add the chopped cucumber and grated carrot to a bowl with your nigella seeds, a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Indian-style salad


### Step 6

Add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

​​Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 7

Once the paneer is golden, add the chopped spinach to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until warmed through

Combine the reserved natural yoghurt with your mint sauce in a small bowl – this is your mint yoghurt

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the warmed naan topped with the paneer tikka, spinach and Indian-style salad

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
