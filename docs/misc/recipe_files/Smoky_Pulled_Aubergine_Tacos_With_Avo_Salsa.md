- Shredded red cabbage (150g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- Coriander (10g)
- Cider vinegar (30ml)
- Coriander (5g) x0
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalks on

Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, then add the aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the flesh has softened


### Step 2

Combine your shredded red cabbage, cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar in a bowl and mix well, then set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage

Once the aubergine has been cooking for 15 min, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once the pan is hot, add most of the sliced onion (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise


### Step 4

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the smashed avocado, chopped coriander and juice of half your lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with a pinch of salt and gently mix – this is your avo salsa


### Step 5

Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skins with a spoon – this is your pulled aubergine

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily

Discard the skins


### Step 6

Once the onion has started to caramelise, add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the pulled aubergine, agave, soy sauce, BBQ sauce and a generous grind of black pepper to the pan then cook for 2-3 min until everything's combined – this your smoky pulled aubergine


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Drain the quick-pickled red cabbage, discard the liquid

Slice the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Divide the smoky pulled aubergine evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top with the avo salsa and quick-pickled red cabbage

Garnish with the remaining sliced onion and lime wedges

Enjoy!
