### Step 1

Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Make steps 2-4 the night before and finish the rest in the morning

Cover and store in the fridge overnight and enjoy within 24 hours

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 3

Combine the chopped cherry tomatoes with your smashed avocado


### Step 4

Add most of your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), half your pine kernel & seed mix (you’ll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli smashed avo & cherry tomatoes

Tip: Busy morning ahead? Prep tonight, cover and store in the fridge!


### Step 5

Crumble your Greek cheese into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 6

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 2-3 min or until golden and toasted


### Step 7

Spread the toasted ciabatta[s] with a knob of butter

### Step 8

To build, divide your chilli smashed avo & cherry tomatoes between the buttered ciabatta halves

Top with the crumbled Greek cheese, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the remaining pine kernel & seed mix – this is your chilli smashed avo, cherry tomato & Greek cheese toast

Time to start your day!
