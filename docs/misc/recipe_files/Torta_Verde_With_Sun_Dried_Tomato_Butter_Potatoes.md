## Description

Inspired by the Torta Pasqualina from the Italian Riviera, this riff on the springtime Ligurian pie is an Easter showstopper.

## Ingredients

- Spring greens (150g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Sun-dried tomato pesto (45g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- British free range egg x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Fine green beans (80g)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Wash, your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, chopped shallot and garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the spring greens have wilted down

Once wilted, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your soft cheese and vegetable stock mix – this is your torta filling


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes in half

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 4

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to the tray[s] and prick it all over with a fork (this will stop it getting a soggy bottom!)


### Step 5

Top the rolled pastry with the torta filling, leaving a 2cm border and reserve the pan

Fold the pastry border over the edge of the filling

Tip: Start from one corner and work around in one direction, overlapping the pastry each time

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 9 min or until the pastry edges have puffed up


### Step 6

After the initial 9 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Crack your egg[s] into the centre, then add a generous grind of pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 7-8 min or until the egg[s] are cooked (the yolk should still be a little runny) and the pastry is golden and cooked through – this is your torta verde


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the halved green beans and a small pinch of salt to the pan with a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until softened

Once the potatoes are cooked, add them to the green beans with your sun-dried tomato pesto and a small knob of butter and mix it all together until warmed through – these are your sun-dried tomato butter potatoes & green beans

### Step 8

Serve the torta verde with the sun-dried tomato butter potatoes & green beans to the side

Enjoy!
