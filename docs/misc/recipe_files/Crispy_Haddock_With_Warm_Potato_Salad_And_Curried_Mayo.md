## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add the spinach to a heatproof bowl with the halved waxy potatoes, cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the spinach has wilted


### Step 4

Add the halved green beans to a pot and cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook for 3-4 min or until tender


### Step 5

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Add your cornflour to a medium sized bowl with your ground turmeric, half your curry powder (you’ll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the haddock bites to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the haddock bites are fully coated


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated haddock and cook for 5-6 min, turning once half way, or until golden, crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are cooked, add the cooked green beans and nigella seeds with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your warm potato salad

Combine your mayo and remaining curry powder in a small bowl – this is your curried mayo

### Step 8

Serve the crispy haddock with the warm potato salad and curried mayo to the side

Enjoy!
