## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix


### Step 2

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to the Cajun-style spice mix and turn until fully coated in all the spices


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 5

Add your shredded red cabbage, shredded lettuce and drained sweetcorn to a bowl and set aside


### Step 6

Cut your lime[s] in half

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the juice of the lime to a small bowl with your natural yoghurt and most of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your limey dressing


### Step 7

Add the limey dressing to the bowl with the vegetables and give everything a good mix up – this is your crunchy slaw

### Step 8

Serve the Cajun-style free range chicken over the crunchy slaw

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
