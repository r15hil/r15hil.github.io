## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the pork mince is cooking, dissolve your honey, mirin, rice vinegar, ginger & garlic paste and soy sauce in 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your soy stock


### Step 4

Once the pork mince is beginning to brown, crumble your chestnut mushrooms directly into the pan, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the mushrooms are starting to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, keeping the whites and greens separate


### Step 6

Add the spring onion whites, udon noodles, soy stock and a grind of pepper to the pan, gently separating the noodles with a fork as you add them to the pan

Cook, covered, for 2-3 min, stirring occasionally until the noodles are soft and coated in the sauce and the pork mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the noodles have softened, remove the pan from the heat and add your toasted sesame oil and stir it all together – this is your sesame pork & mushroom udon noodle stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the sesame pork & mushroom udon noodle stir-fry

Garnish with the spring onion greens and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
