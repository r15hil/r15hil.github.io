### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into thin wedges

Deseed the pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Dice your tomato[es] roughly

### Step 2

Add the potato wedges and sliced pepper to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are golden and the pepper is beginning to char

### Step 3

While the potato wedges and pepper strips are in the oven, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and grate your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the sliced shallot and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your meat-free patty[ies] to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

### Step 5

Once the shallot has softened, add your ground smoked paprika and diced tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min

Add your tomato paste and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 2-3 min further or until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has reduced to a jam-like consistency – this is your bravas relish

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside

### Step 6

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine your mayo, remaining grated garlic and most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) in a small bowl

Add a little splash of cold water to loosen, season with a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby aioli

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1729780138054-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and once the patty[ies] is almost cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the ciabatta halves to the other side of the tray[s], cut side up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the ciabatta is warmed through

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Dress the salad with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together

### Step 8

To build your burger, add a dollop of herby aioli over the warmed ciabatta base and the bravas relish over each ciabatta lid, then layer on a meat-free patty, the charred sliced pepper and some salad leaves

Serve the wedges and the remaining salad to the side, dollop the remaining herby aioli over the top and sprinkle over the remaining parsley

Enjoy!
