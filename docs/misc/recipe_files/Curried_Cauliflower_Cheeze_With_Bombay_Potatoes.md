Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

### Step 2

Add the halved potatoes to a baking tray with your ground turmeric, half the garam masala (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your Bombay potatoes

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add your vegetable stock mix, remaining garam masala, 3/4 of your curry powder (save the rest for later!), creamy single soy and grated cheeze to the pot and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your curried cheeze sauce

### Step 4

Boil a full kettle

Cut your cauliflower into small florets, discard the stem and leaves

Add the cauliflower florets to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once done, drain, return to the pot and keep covered

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your coriander, including the stalks

Combine the chopped coriander, panko breadcrumbs and remaining curry powder in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – these are your coriander breadcrumbs

### Step 6

Add the cooked cauliflower to an oven-proof dish, pour over the curried cheeze sauce and top with the coriander breadcrumbs

Put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden, bubbling and thickened – this is your plant-based curried cauliflower cheeze

### Step 7

When the cauliflower cheeze is nearly done, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a large bowl with your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and toss it all together – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based curried cauliflower cheeze with the Bombay potatoes and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
