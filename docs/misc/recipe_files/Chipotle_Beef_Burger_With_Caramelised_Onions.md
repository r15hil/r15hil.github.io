### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook the onion until ready to serve or until they have softened and caramelised

### Step 3

Meanwhile, season your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patty[ies] to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Shape the mince into 1 patty per person and refrigerate until later

### Step 4

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted (save the pan for later!)

### Step 5

Combine your mayo with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>outer lettuce leaf per person and set them aside for serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into bite-sized pieces

Add the torn lettuce leaves to a bowl and mix with a drizzle of olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper – this is your crisp lettuce salad

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patty[ies] and press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Reduce the heat to medium-high, flip each patty and cook for a further 5 min or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Keep pressing the patty[ies] down with a spatula to keep them flat

### Step 8

Top your toasted brioche base with a lettuce leaf, a generous dollop of the chipotle mayo, a beef burger patty, caramelised onions and the toasted brioche lid – this is your chipotle beef burger with caramelised onions

Serve any remaining chipotle mayo with the chips and crisp lettuce salad to the side

Enjoy!
