- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Red chilli
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Ciabatta x2
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- White potato x3
- Feta (30g)
- British beef mince (250g)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop half your shallot[s]

Slice the remaining shallot finely

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice finely


### Step 3

Add your beef mince to a large bowl with the chopped shallot

Add half your ground smoked paprika with a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and mix thoroughly until fully combined – this is your cevapi mixture


### Step 4

Divide the cevapi mixture and roll into 3 little sausage shapes per person – these are your patties

Add the patties to a baking tray (or two!) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven[s] for 12-15 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!) – this is your cevapi


### Step 5

While the cevapi patties are cooking, add the chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor with the chopped garlic and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Blitz until combined – this is your chilli dressing

Once done, set aside until serving


### Step 6

Add your soft cheese to a medium bowl with your feta, a pinch of salt and the remaining white wine vinegar and give everything a good mix up until smooth – this is your kaymak cheese

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely


### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Combine your mayo with your remaining smoked paprika – this is your smoky mayo

### Step 8

Fill the toasted ciabatta with the smoky mayo, some of the shredded lettuce, the cevapi and half the kaymak cheese

Add the sliced shallot and drizzle over half the chilli dressing – this is your Serbian-style cevapi sandwich

Serve the chips and remaining lettuce to the side with the remaining kaymak cheese and the remaining chilli dressing all over

Enjoy!
