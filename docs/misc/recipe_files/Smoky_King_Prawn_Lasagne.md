### Step 7

Layer some of the smoky king prawn ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with 3 lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta and repeat until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish

Cover with the béchamel, then top with the remaining grated cheddar and cook in the oven for 20-25 min or until the pasta is cooked

### Step 8

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the smoky king prawn lasagne with the rocket to the side

Enjoy!
