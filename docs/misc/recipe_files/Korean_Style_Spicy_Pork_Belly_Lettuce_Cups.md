### Step 1

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Pat the pork belly dry with kitchen paper

Chop the pork belly in half lengthways, then slice into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> slices and season generously with salt

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork belly slices and cook for 15-18 min, turning every couple of minutes until very golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Reduce the heat to medium after approx. 5 min, once the pan gets very hot!

### Step 5

Add the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) and ginger to a pestle & mortar and grind to a paste

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil with the sriracha, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!)

Stir it all together – this is your spicy sauce

### Step 6

Chop the root<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the little gem lettuce and separate the leaves

Cut the cucumber in half and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away

Slice the cucumber into thin batons

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

### Step 7

Once the pork is cooked through and crispy, add the dried chilli flakes  (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs further

Add the remaining soy sauce and honey and cook for 1 min further, turning the pork until it's fully coated and sticky – this is your sticky pork

### Step 8

Fill the lettuce leaves with some cooked rice, cucumber batons, sticky pork and sliced green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just use a little chilli!)

Enjoy!
