## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Whilst the beef mince is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 6

Once the beef has browned, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground cumin and ground smoked paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan with the drained black beans and a pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chilli con carne

### Step 8

Serve the chilli con carne with the cooked rice

Enjoy!
