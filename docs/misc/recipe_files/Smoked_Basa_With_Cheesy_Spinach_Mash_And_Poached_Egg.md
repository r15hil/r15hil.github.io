## Ingredients

- Spinach (120g)
- Spinach (80g) x0
- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Spring onion x2
- British free range egg x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle


### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Add the chopped potatoes and garlic to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can,


### Step 4

Chop the spinach roughly

Reboil half a kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely


### Step 5

Place your smoked basa fillet[s] on a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle them with a little olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Bring a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Crack your egg[s] gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the eggs[s] with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper and season them with salt and pepper – these are your poached egg[s]


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then add the chopped spinach

Stir in the grated cheese and sliced spring onion and season with a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your cheesy spinach mash

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa over the cheesy spinach mash and top with a poached egg

Season with a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!
