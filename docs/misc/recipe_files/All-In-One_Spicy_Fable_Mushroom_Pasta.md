### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]

### Step 7

Once the spicy tomato ragù has been cooking for 20 min, remove the dish from the oven, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir

Add your conchiglie and mix it all together so that the pasta is nestled into the sauce

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 25 min or until the pasta is cooked through – this is your all-in-one spicy Fable mushroom pasta
