## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 5g rosemary
- 2 x 150g British beef picanha rump steak
- 1 British free-range egg
- 400g potatoes
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 15g capers
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Roast the potatoes


Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 395&deg;F/ Gas 6.


Chop the potatoes (skins&nbsp;on) into small bite-sized pieces.


Strip the rosemary leaves from the stalks.


Crush the garlic (skins on) with the back of a knife.


Add the potatoes, rosemary leaves and crushed garlic to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up.


Put the tray in the oven and cook for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy.


### Step 2

Prepare the steaks


Meanwhile, trim the fat from the rump steaks.


Cover the steaks in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until flat and approx. half a cm in thickness.&nbsp;


Tip: this will make the steaks really tender!


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Prepare the ingredients for breading


Add a handful of&nbsp;flour&nbsp;to a plate with a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and&nbsp;pepper.


Crack the&nbsp;egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork.


Add the&nbsp;panko breadcrumbs&nbsp;to a plate with the grated Italian hard cheese, dried oregano and a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and&nbsp;pepper.


### Step 4

Bread the steaks


Coat the steaks in the flour, tap off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg and press it into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to coat everything evenly.&nbsp;


Tip: make sure the steaks are fully coated in the breadcrumbs!


### Step 5

Make the lemon &amp; caper dressing


Boil a kettle.


Chop the capers roughly.


Chop&nbsp;the basil leaves finely.


Combine the chopped capers with the chopped basil leaves, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt&nbsp;&ndash; this is your lemon &amp; caper dressing.


### Step 6

Blanch the broccoli&nbsp;


Add the Tenderstem&nbsp;broccoli&nbsp;to a pot of&nbsp;boiling water&nbsp;with a pinch of&nbsp;salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until tender


Drain and rinse under&nbsp;cold water&nbsp;to cool them down slightly and stir through the&nbsp;lemon &amp; caper dressing.


Set this aside until serving.&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Step 7

Fry the steaks


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat.


Once hot, add the&nbsp;breaded steaks&nbsp;and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden brown.


Once done, transfer to a cooling rack (you can use the rack from your grill!) to rest and season with a pinch of&nbsp;salt.


Tip: resting on a cooling rack will make sure your crumb stays crisp!

### Step 8

Serve up!


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges.


Serve the steak milanese with the rosemary &amp; garlic potatoes and lemon &amp; caper broccoli to the side.


Enjoy!
