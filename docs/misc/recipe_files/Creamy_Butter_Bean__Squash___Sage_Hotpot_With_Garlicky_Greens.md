### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Drain and rinse your butter beans


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Strip your sage leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your butternut squash cubes, drained butter beans, half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!), bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chopped sage to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix, umami seasoning, creamy single soy and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has started to thicken – this is your creamy butter bean, squash & sage filling

Transfer the creamy butter bean, squash & sage filling to an oven-proof dish (reserve the pan) and carefully arrange the potato discs over the top

Season with a pinch of salt and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min – this is your butter bean, squash & sage hotpot


### Step 6

While the hotpot is in the oven, wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 7

Once the hotpot is almost cooked, wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and remaining chopped garlic

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Serve the creamy butter bean, squash & sage hotpot with the garlicky greens to the side

Discard the bay leaf[ves]
