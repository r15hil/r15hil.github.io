## Ingredients

- 250g British beef strips
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 300g broccoli brown rice
- 15ml soy sauce
- 300g chopped broccoli & green beans
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 3g cornflour
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped broccoli & green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the broccoli brown rice to a large, heatproof bowl and put the bowl in the microwave for 2-3 min or until piping hot


### Step 3

Once the vegetables have started to soften, add the beef strips, half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the ginger & garlic paste

Sprinkle over the cornflour and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min, to sear the beef strips, but prevent them from overcooking


### Step 4

Once the beef is seared, add the hoisin sauce and soy sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and cook for 1 min further until the sauce has thickened – this is your Chinese beef & broccoli stir fry

### Step 5

Serve the Chinese beef & broccoli stir fry over the warmed broccoli brown rice

Sprinkle over the toasted sesame seeds and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of heat? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
