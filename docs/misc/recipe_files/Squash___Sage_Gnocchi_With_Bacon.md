## Description

As the weather turns colder, there's nothing more comforting than a bowl of warming gnocchi. Whilst you roast your seasonal British squash, you'll also be creating a delicious sage burnt butter sauce (known as a 'beurre noisette'). You'll then stir in the gnocchi, before topping your dish off with crispy bacon shards.
