## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Linguine (100g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Linguine (190g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min

Remove the pan from the heat and leave the garlic to infuse the oil


### Step 3

Chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into small bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Return the pan with the garlic oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped basa and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

While the basa is cooking, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Slice the remaining non-zested lemon into wedges and reserve for garnish


### Step 6

Once the basa is nearly cooked through, add your Chinese rice wine, soft cheese and 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water to the pan and cook for 2 min

Wash your spinach, then add it to the pan along with the juice of the zested lemon

Season very generously with salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach is wilted and you are left with a loose sauce

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Add the drained linguine to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony smoked basa & spinach linguine

### Step 8

Serve the lemony smoked basa & spinach linguine and top with the lemon zest and a generous grind of pepper

Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
