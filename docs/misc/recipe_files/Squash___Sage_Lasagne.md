## Description

This classic combo of squash and sage hails from the sunny plains of Emilia-Romagna and is the star of the show in this dish. Roasting the butternut squash intensifies its sweetness, which cuts through the rich, creamy, cheesy goodness of the lasagne. Just sit back and relax while the oven does its work.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Peel the butternut squash<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and cut in half


Tip: Use a sharp knife drizzled with a little vegetable oil for easier chopping


Scoop out the seeds and discard


Slice finely into half-moons


### Step 2

Add the sliced butternut squash to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


Once softened, add the chopped garlic and baby leaf spinach and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 4

Dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water


Heat a pot over a medium heat with 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter and once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until a roux (sandy paste) has formed


Stir the stock gradually into the roux and cook for 1-2 min


Add the crème fraîche and stir well until combined – this is your white sauce


### Step 5

Spoon 1/4 of the white sauce over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with 1/3 of the spinach &amp; onion mix and 1/3 of the roasted butternut squash and 2 lasagne sheets


Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets 


 Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish


### Step 6

Top the lasagne sheets with the remaining white sauce


Pick the sage leaves from their stalks and layer them on top


Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and a good grind of black pepper and put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until cooked through and golden – this is your squash &amp; sage lasagne


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have an aperitivo or simply chill!


Once the squash &amp; sage lasagne is done, remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly


Meanwhile, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl 


Wash and drain the rocket, then add it to the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your rocket salad

### Step 8

Serve the squash &amp; sage lasagne with the rocket salad to the side


Buon appetito!
