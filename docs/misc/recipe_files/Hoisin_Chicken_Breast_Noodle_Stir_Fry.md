## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 6 min


### Step 3

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Wash then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain and rinse your sweetcorn


### Step 5

Once the chicken has had 6 min, add the sliced shallot and chopped pak choi bases to the pan and cook for 2 min until softened


### Step 6

Combine your hoisin sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce in a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your hoisin stir-fry sauce


### Step 7

Add the hoisin stir-fry sauce, pak choi green tops, drained noodles and drained sweetcorn to the pan with the chicken, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 2 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your hoisin chicken breast noodle stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin chicken breast noodle stir-fry in a bowl and top with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
