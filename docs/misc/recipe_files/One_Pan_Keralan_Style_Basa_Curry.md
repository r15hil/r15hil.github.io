## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the tomato wedges and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Combine the chopped creamed coconut with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [425ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Once the tomatoes are beginning to soften, add your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder, ground turmeric, black mustard seeds and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa and halved green beans to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Once the basa is cooked and the green beans are tender, add the cooked rice, vegetable stock mix and a pinch of salt to the pan

Gently stir everything together – this is your one-pot Keralan-style basa curry

### Step 8

Serve the one-pan Keralan-style basa curry and garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
