## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and grate your garlic

Chop your chicken breast strips into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once soft, increase the heat to high and add the chopped chicken breast, chopped ginger, grated garlic and your curry powder and cook for 3-4 min further or until the chicken is starting to brown


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chopped creamed coconut, tamarind paste, vegetable stock mix and rice vinegar in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tamarind stock


### Step 5

Once the chicken has started to brown, add the chopped tomato to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until soft


### Step 6

Once soft, add the tamarind stock to the pan and cook, on a medium-high heat, for 4-5 min until sauce has reduced to curry like consistency


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1 min or until they're warm and your chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tamarind, chicken & pea curry

### Step 8

Serve the tamarind, chicken & pea curry with the brown rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
