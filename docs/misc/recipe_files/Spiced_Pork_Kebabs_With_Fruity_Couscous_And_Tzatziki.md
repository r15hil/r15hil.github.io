## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!), baharat and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the pork mixture and roll into 2 sausage shapes per person – these are your spiced pork kebabs


### Step 3

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper

Add the spiced pork kebabs to one side of the tray[s]

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and red onion wedges to the other side and sprinkle over your dried oregano with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give the veg a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the kebabs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the tomatoes have softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grate your cucumber


### Step 5

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

Add your couscous, sultanas and lemon zest to a heatproof bowl, with a generous pinch of salt and mix it all together

Add your chicken stock to the bowl, then cover with a tea towel and set aside


### Step 6

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), half the chopped mint (save the rest for later!) and grated cucumber to a separate bowl with your natural yoghurt and the juice of half your lemon[s] and stir it all together – this is your tzatziki

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person


### Step 7

Once the veg is cooked, fluff up the couscous and stir through the roasted veg and remaining chopped mint – this is your fruity couscous

### Step 8

Serve the spiced pork kebabs with the fruity couscous to the side

Add a dollop of tzatziki and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
