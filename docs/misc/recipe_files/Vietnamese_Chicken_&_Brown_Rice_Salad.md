### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast fillet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a matching lid, over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden


Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid


Cook for a further 10-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Cut the red&nbsp;chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely


Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Combine the rice vinegar, lime juice, chopped chilli&nbsp;and&nbsp;fish sauce&nbsp;in a small bowl &ndash; this is your Vietnamese dressing

### Step 5

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger">,</span> then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Cut the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and slice finely


Slice the radishes as finely as you can into thin rounds


Combine the carrot ribbons, sliced cucumber and radishes with the Vietnamese dressing and a pinch of salt&nbsp;in a large bowl&nbsp;

### Step 6

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


Trim and finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Chop the roasted peanuts coarsely (or bash them in their bag)

### Step 7

Once the&nbsp;chicken&nbsp;is cooked, transfer it to a plate and leave the pan over a medium heat (no need to give it a clean!)


Add the soy sauce sachets&nbsp;and&nbsp;honey&nbsp;and cook for 2-3 min, stirring all the time, until the sauce has thickened and is sticky


Once sticky, remove the pan from the heat, return the chicken to the pan and turn it in the glaze until it's fully coated

### Step 8

Slice the chicken and serve over the brown rice with the salad to the side


Garnish with the chopped mint,&nbsp;coriander, spring onion&nbsp;and crushed peanuts&nbsp;


Drizzle over the remaining&nbsp;dressing


Enjoy!
