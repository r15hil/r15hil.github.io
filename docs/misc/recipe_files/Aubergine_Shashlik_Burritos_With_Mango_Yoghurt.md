## Ingredients

- 1 gem lettuce
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 20g mango chutney
- 1 tomato
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 100g basmati rice
- 4 plain tortillas
- 1/2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 aubergine
- 1 brown onion
- 30g sultanas

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut lengthways into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> wedges

Peel and cut the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into quarters


### Step 2

Transfer the aubergine wedges and onion quarters to a roasting tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 3

Add the basmati rice, sultanas, vegetable stock mix, ground turmeric and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your pilau rice


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the mango chutney, nigella seeds and natural yoghurt to a small bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your mango yoghurt


### Step 5

Once the aubergine has had an initial 20 min, add the curry powder, smoked paprika and a splash of cold water to the roasting tray and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the aubergine is cooked through– this is your curried aubergine & onions


### Step 6

While the aubergine is cooking, add the tortillas to a separate tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min until warmed through

Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12] </span>wedges


### Step 7

Top half of each warmed tortilla with the pilau rice, curried aubergine & onions, shredded lettuce and tomato wedges

Dollop the mango yoghurt over the top

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!

### Step 8

To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a burrito – these are your aubergine shashlik burritos

Wrap the burritos in tin foil to hold everything together, then slice in half

Enjoy!
