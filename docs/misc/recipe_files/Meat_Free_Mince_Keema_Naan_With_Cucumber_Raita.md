## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 20g mango chutney
- 1 tomato
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 2 plain naans
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Put 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> large baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven to heat up (this will stop the base of your naan from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then combine with the red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 4

Push the browned meat-free mince to one side of the pan

Add the ground cumin, garam masala and a drizzle of vegetable oil to the other side of the pan and cook for 1-2 min until fragrant


### Step 5

Add the tomato wedges and vegetable stock to the pan and stir everything together

Cook for 1-2 min or until reduced – this is your spiced meat-free mince


### Step 6

Meanwhile, spread the mango chutney over the naans and add them to the warmed baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top the naans with the spiced meat-free mince

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven and cook for 5-10 min or until golden – these are your meat-free mince keema naans


### Step 7

While the naans are in the oven, cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add the grated cucumber, natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber raita

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free mince keema naans with a dollop of cucumber raita

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot

Enjoy!
