### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes into bite-sized pieces (skins on), then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 10 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Trim your green beans

### Step 3

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle most of your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) over the basa with a pinch of salt and pepper and rub into both sides until evenly coated – this is your curried basa

### Step 4

Reboil a kettle

Add the curried basa to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 9 min

### Step 5

While the basa is cooking, dissolve your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the potatoes are done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the grated ginger and chopped garlic to the pan with your garam masala, ground turmeric, remaining curry powder and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant, then add the boiled potatoes, tomato stock, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high, give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your aloo tamatar masala

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1674825300857-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

After the basa has had an initial 9 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your trimmed green beans to the other side with your cumin seeds, a drizzle of olive oil and the chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] back in the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the green beans are tender and the basa is cooked through – this is your curried basa and spiced green beans

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the curried basa with the aloo tamatar masala and spiced green beans to the side

Garnish the aloo tamatar masala with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
