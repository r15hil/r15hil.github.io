### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add a handful of flour to a plate along with your ground paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your spiced flour

### Step 2

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the grated cheese, lots of pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

### Step 3

Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into<span class="text-danger"> </span>strips

Coat the chicken strips in the spiced flour (make sure to tap off any excess!)

Add the coated chicken strips to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded free range chicken strips

### Step 4

Line a baking tray with tin foil

Add the breaded free range chicken strips to the tray and top them with any remaining cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your crispy free range chicken strips

### Step 6

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1729775168451-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

### Step 8

Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy free range chicken strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!
