### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Meanwhile, combine your white miso paste and half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) until you have a loose paste – this is your miso marinade

### Step 3

Add your chicken breast strips to the miso marinade

Give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated, then set aside for later – these are your miso chicken strips

### Step 4

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your mayo to a small bowl with your shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a splash of cold water to loosen then stir it all together – this is your shichimi togarashi mayo

### Step 5

Add your cornflour, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and a generous pinch of salt to a plate, mix together with a fork until well combined

Place the miso chicken strips onto the floured plate, pressing firmly to coat the chicken evenly on both sides, then set aside – this is your coated chicken

Tip: Coat the chicken in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 10-12 min, turning halfway or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your miso chicken goujons

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1678205229601-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

When the chicken goujons are nearly cooked, boil a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water over them to refresh

Add the refreshed peas to a bowl with the sliced spring onion, soy sauce, remaining rice vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and most of the chopped coriander (save a little for garnish!) and mix well – these are your Asian-style peas

### Step 8

Serve the sushi rice with the miso chicken goujons, Asian-style peas and shichimi togarashi mayo to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish the rice with the remaining coriander

Enjoy!
