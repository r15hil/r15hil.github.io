## Ingredients

- 250g baby plum tomatoes
- 1/2 tin of sweetcorn (170g)
- 130g basmati rice
- 10g coriander
- 2 mayonnaise sachets (30ml)
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika 
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet 
- 1 spring onion
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a knob of butter over a high heat


Once melted, add half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the drained sweetcorn and a big pinch of salt


Cook for 2 min or until the sweetcorn has browned slightly&nbsp;


### Step 2

Add the&nbsp;basmati rice and stir to coat the grains


Add&nbsp;300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span>&nbsp;water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is tender &ndash; this is your corn rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine the smoked&nbsp;paprika and ground&nbsp;allspice in a mixing bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;pepper and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span>&nbsp;salt


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast fillet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces


Add the sliced&nbsp;chicken to the spice mix and mix everything up until the chicken is fully coated&nbsp;


<span style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span>


### Step 4

Heat a separate pan with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3-4 min on both&nbsp;sides or until cooked through, then transfer to a clean chopping board


Note: the chicken will appear very dark and burnt &ndash; don't panic, this is how it's meant to be!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the baby plum tomatoes in half&nbsp;


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely


Combine the mayonnaise with the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and season with a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;&ndash; this is your lime mayo


Add the baby plum&nbsp;tomatoes to the cooked corn rice and warm it through for&nbsp;1 min


### Step 6

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


Slice the blackened&nbsp;chicken


### Step 7

Fluff the&nbsp;corn&nbsp;rice with a fork, taste and add more salt and pepper if needed&nbsp;


Remove the pan from the heat and stir the sliced&nbsp;spring onion and chopped coriander through&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken over the corn rice


Drizzle the lime mayo over


Enjoy!
