## Ingredients

- 30g lighter cheese
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 160g arborio rice
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 100g British bacon lardons
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 80g spinach
- 5g parsley
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the bacon lardons and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy

Transfer the crispy bacon to a plate and reserve the pan with any remaining oil for later


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Slice the chestnut mushrooms roughly


### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, chopped garlic and sliced mushrooms with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

While the vegetables are cooking, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water


### Step 5

Once the vegetables have softened, add the arborio rice and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min or until the Chinese rice wine has evaporated


### Step 6

Once evaporated, add the vegetable stock to the pan a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your mushroom risotto

While the risotto is cooking, grate the lighter cheese

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once cooked, stir half the grated lighter cheese (save the rest for garnish!) through the mushroom risotto

Wash the spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add to the pan and stir until the spinach has wilted

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom risotto with the crispy bacon, remaining grated lighter cheese and chopped parsley over the top

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
