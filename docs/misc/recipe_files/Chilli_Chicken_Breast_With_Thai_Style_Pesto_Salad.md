## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Drain and rinse your chickpeas, add them to a baking tray with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – these are your roasted chickpeas


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a small pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stems


### Step 4

Add your ginger paste, chopped basil, half your roasted peanuts and half the chopped mint and chopped coriander (you’ll use the rest later!) to a pestle & mortar

Add a generous pinch of salt and grind to a thick paste

Add your toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and mix it all together – this is your Thai-style pesto

Tip: Alternatively, use a food processor!


### Step 5

Combine your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of half your lime[s] and your soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your chilli & lime marinade


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for an initial 4-5 min on each side or until golden

Add the chilli & lime marinade and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chilli chicken


### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the sliced shallot, salad, and remaining chopped mint and chopped coriander to the cooked bulgur and give it a good mix up – this is your bulgur salad

Roughly chop the remaining roasted peanuts and chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the chilli chicken over the bulgur salad and drizzle the Thai-style pesto all over

Garnish with the chopped roasted peanuts, roasted chickpeas and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
