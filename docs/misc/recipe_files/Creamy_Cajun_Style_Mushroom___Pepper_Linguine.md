### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of salt, a pinch of sugar and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix

### Step 2

Brush the top side of your portobello mushroom[s] with a little vegetable oil (this helps the spices stick!)

Press the oiled side of the portobello mushroom[s] into the Cajun-style spice mix and save the rest of the spice mix for later – this is your Cajun-style spiced portobello mushroom

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 6

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

### Step 7

Once the veg has softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated

Add the creamy stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

Once thickened, add the drained linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy Cajun-style pepper linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Slice the spiced portobello mushroom[s] finely

Serve the sliced spiced portobello mushroom over the creamy Cajun-style pepper linguine

Enjoy!
