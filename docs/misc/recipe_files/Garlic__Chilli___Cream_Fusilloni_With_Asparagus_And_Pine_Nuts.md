### Step 2

Add your fusilloni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, transfer the pine nuts to a plate and reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Meanwhile, trim the woody ends off your asparagus and discard

Chop the asparagus tips away from the stalks, then roughly chop the asparagus stalks

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste with the chopped asparagus

Add your double cream with your Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock mix and the reserved starchy pasta water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until the asparagus is tender and the sauce has thickened – this is your garlic, chilli & cream sauce
