### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!), a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and golden

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a medium sized pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Combine the chopped creamed coconut, soy sauce and fish sauce with 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1050ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste, remaining curry powder and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and lime leaf[ves] and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, season with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min – this is your curried laksa

### Step 5

Reboil a full kettle

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)

### Step 6

Add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1692968782515-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake and chopped coriander stalks to the curried laksa and cook for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through (discard the lime leaf[ves]) – this is your curried hake laksa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Drain the soaked noodles, then serve in a bowl topped with the curried hake laksa and roasted squash

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
