### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven and cook for an initial 20 min or until starting to crisp

### Step 2

Whilst the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a pot over a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened

Once softened, add a pinch of sugar and cook for 1-2 min further – these are your caramelised onions

### Step 3

Meanwhile, strip the rosemary leaves from their stems, then chop them roughly and discard the stems (hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves)

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> slices

Combine the chilli relish and mayo in a small bowl – this is your chilli mayo

Slice the brioche buns in half

### Step 4

Wash the gem lettuce, then remove 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> leaves and set them aside and pat them dry with kitchen paper, then cut the remaining lettuce into wedges

Once the chips have had an initial 20 min, create some space on the tray and put the meat-free burger patties in the oven for an initial 10 min or until almost cooked through

Tip: If you're cooking for 4, you may need to cook your patties on a separate tray!

### Step 5

Whilst the meat-free burgers are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy on both sides

### Step 6

Once the meat-free bacon is crispy, chop half of it finely (save the full rashers for the burger!)

Combine the chopped meat-free bacon with the chopped rosemary leaves – this is your rosemary & meat-free bacon crumb

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1607951306380-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the meat-free burgers are almost cooked through, top them with a cheese flavour slice – these are your cheezy patties

Add the brioche halves, cut-side up, to a separate tray and put both trays in the oven for 2-3 min further or until the bread is toasted and the cheese flavour slice is melted

### Step 8

To assemble, fill the toasted brioche halves with the chilli mayo, cheezy patties, reserved crispy meat-free bacon rashers, tomato slices and outer lettuce leaves – these are your plant-based bacon cheezeburgers

Serve the lettuce wedges and fries to the side, then spoon the caramelised onions and rosemary & meat-free bacon crumb over the fries – these are your fancy fries

Enjoy!
