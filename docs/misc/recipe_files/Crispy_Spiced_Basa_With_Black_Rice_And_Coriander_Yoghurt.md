## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 tomato
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 30g gram flour
- 15ml soy sauce
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 5g coriander
- 130g black rice
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 lemon

## Instructions

### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add the black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 30 min or until it's tender (it will still have a slight bite to it when cooked)

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Cover with a lid until serving

### Step 2

Chop the basa fillets into large, bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Combine the chopped basa with the soy sauce and ginger & garlic paste in a medium bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated basa

Add the gram flour and ground cumin to a separate bowl with most of the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your spiced gram flour

### Step 4

Cut the cucumber in half and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, then cut into small pieces

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

### Step 5

Combine the chopped cucumber and chopped tomato in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, half the natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!), the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato salad

Add the marinated basa to the bowl with the spiced gram flour and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated basa

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the remaining natural yoghurt and chopped coriander to a small bowl with the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>,<span class="text-danger"> </span>a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the crispy spiced basa over the black rice with the tomato salad to the side

Drizzle over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
