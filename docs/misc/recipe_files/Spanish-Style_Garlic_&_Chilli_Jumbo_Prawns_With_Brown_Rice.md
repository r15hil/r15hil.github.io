### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

### Step 3

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes and most of your roasted garlic paste (save the rest for your aioli later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until the tomatoes have started to soften

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 4

Once the tomatoes have started to soften, add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, spinach and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 5

Drain, then add your jumbo prawns to the pan and cook for 6-7 min further – these are your Spanish-style garlic & chilli jumbo prawns

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 6

While the prawns are cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Combine the remaining roasted garlic paste (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), mayo and a the juice of half your lemon[s] in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic aioli

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Spanish-style garlic & chilli jumbo prawns over the cooked brown rice

Drizzle the garlic aioli over the top and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
