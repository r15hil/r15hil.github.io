## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Slice your cucumber into discs, then slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Top, tail and peel your carrots, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons


### Step 3

Tear your ciabatta[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the torn ciabatta to a baking tray with your toasted sesame oil, black sesame seeds and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until golden and crisp – these are your sesame croutons


### Step 4

Add your hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> </span><span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your hoisin dressing


### Step 5

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them roughly and discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the carrot ribbons, cucumber matchsticks, sliced shallot, salad, sesame croutons and most of the chopped mint and coriander (save some for garnish!) to the bowl with the hoisin dressing and give it a gentle mix up – this is your bánh mì-style salad


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

### Step 8

Serve the pulled free range chicken over the bánh mì-style salad – this is your bánh mì-style free range chicken salad

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint and coriander

Enjoy!
