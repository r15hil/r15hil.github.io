### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Boil half a kettle

### Step 2

Drain your tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Slice the drained tofu into 2 pieces per person, then score in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way

Add the sliced tofu to a large bowl with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your marinated tofu

Dissolve your creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water with a generous pinch of salt – this is your coconut stock

### Step 4

Add the chopped shallot, garlic, chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the chopped coriander stalks to a pestle & mortar

Add a pinch of salt and grind to a paste – this is your Thai-style paste
