### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

### Step 2

Put a large baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pide bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix it all together and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s], then combine the sliced onion with your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your quick-pickled onion

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

### Step 4

Combine the chopped spinach and grated cheddar in a bowl with the chopped garlic and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), soft cheese, half the quick-pickled onion (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy filling

### Step 5

Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 piece per person

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go and knead it for 20 secs with floured hands

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1664348998319-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Roll out each dough ball to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a floured rolling pin into a rough oval shape

Pinch and twist the ends of each oval to form a boat-shape – this is your pide base[s]

Remove the baking tray[s] from the oven and add the pide base[s] (be careful- the tray[s] will be hot!)

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1664349003817-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Fill the pide base[s] with the spicy filling

Crack one egg into each centre and sprinkle over your nigella seeds

Drizzle the crusts with a little olive oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your cheesy harissa & spinach pide

Meanwhile, wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Add the salad to the remaining quick-pickled red onion with the diced apricot and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your apricot salad

Serve the cheesy harissa & spinach pide topped with the remaining sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the apricot salad to the side

Enjoy!
