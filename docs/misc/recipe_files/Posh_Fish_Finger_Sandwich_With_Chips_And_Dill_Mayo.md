## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice your brioche buns in half

Once the pan is hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving, reserve the pan

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour and ground turmeric with a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your spiced cornflour


### Step 4

Cut your basa fillet[s] into strips

Add the basa strips to the spiced cornflour and stir together until they're fully coated in the mixture


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar, chopped dill and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your dill mayo


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove 2 outer lettuce leaves per person, then set aside for serving

Shred your remaining lettuce

### Step 8

Fill your toasted brioche bun[s] with the outer lettuce leaves, the dill mayo and crispy fish fingers – these are your posh fish finger sandwich[es]

Serve the chips and remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle any remaining dill mayo over the shredded lettuce

Enjoy!
