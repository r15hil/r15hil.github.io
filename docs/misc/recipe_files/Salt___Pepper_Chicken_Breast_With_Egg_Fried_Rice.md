## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, slice your chicken breast portion[s] into strips

Add your cornflour to a bowl along with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a very generous pinch of salt, your five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together

Add the chicken strips to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until all the chicken is coated


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the coated chicken strips and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, trim, then roughly chop your spring onions into batons

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds


### Step 5

Once the chicken is crispy, add the spring onion batons, most of the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for 2-3 min until fragrant

Once done, transfer everything to a plate (save the pan!) and set aside until serving – this is your salt & pepper chicken


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooled rice, your blanched peas, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce then stir everything together until combined and cook for 2-3 min


### Step 7

Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the salt & pepper chicken over the egg fried rice

Garnish with the remaining chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
