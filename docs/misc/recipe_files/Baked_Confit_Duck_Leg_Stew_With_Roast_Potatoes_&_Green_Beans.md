### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Separate your duck leg[s] from the white fat and duck jelly (you'll use these in different parts of the recipe!)

Add the white duck fat to a baking tray (or two!)

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Add the onion wedges to the dish

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water, your beef stock mix, tomato paste, roasted garlic paste and duck jelly and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and top with the duck leg[s]

### Step 6

Add the chopped potatoes to the baking tray[s] with the duck fat and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your roast potatoes

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once the potatoes have had an initial 30 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the trimmed green beans with a pinch of pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until the green beans are tender with a bite

### Step 8

Serve the baked confit duck leg stew with the roast potatoes and roasted green beans to the side
