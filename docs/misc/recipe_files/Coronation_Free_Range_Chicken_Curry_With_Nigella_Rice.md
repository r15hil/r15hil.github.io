## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a pot with a lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add your nigella seeds and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains


### Step 2

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your nigella rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until softened


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 5

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water

Add your sultanas and mango chutney to the stock and stir to combine – this is your mango stock


### Step 6

Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped garlic to the softened onion, increase the heat to high and cook for a further 2 min

Add the chopped chicken, ground turmeric, curry powder and a good grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for a further 5-6 min or until everything is coated in spice and the chicken is nearly cooked


### Step 7

Add the mango stock and chopped green beans cook for a further 5-6 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the stock has reduced by half

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in your natural yoghurt and chopped coriander

Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed – this is your coronation chicken curry

### Step 8

Fluff the nigella rice with a fork

Serve the coronation free range chicken curry with the nigella rice and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Sprinkle over your flaked almonds

Enjoy!
