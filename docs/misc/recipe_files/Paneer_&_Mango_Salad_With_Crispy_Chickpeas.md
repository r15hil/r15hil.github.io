### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Add the drained chickpeas to a baking tray with your ground coriander, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy chickpeas

### Step 2

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed and chop finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger and coriander with your rice vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your chilli dressing

### Step 4

Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Slice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone[s]

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped paneer, onion petals and a pinch of salt, and cook for 5-6 min until the paneer is golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

### Step 6

Once the paneer is golden, add your tamarind paste to the pan with a small splash of water

Remove the pan from the heat and stir it all together until everything's coated in the tamarind sauce

### Step 7

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad, paneer cubes, red onion petals, sliced mango and chilli dressing to a large bowl

Gently mix together – this is your paneer & mango salad

### Step 8

Serve the paneer & mango salad with the crispy chickpeas over the top

Enjoy!
