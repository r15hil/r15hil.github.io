## Ingredients

- Living lettuce
- Pitted black olives (60g)
- Arborio rice (160g)
- Tomato x2
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Feta (30g)
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Parsley & chive (10g)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Add your tomatoes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 35-40 min or until softened – these are your roasted whole tomatoes


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the shallot and garlic are softening, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 700ml<span class="text-purple"> [1.05L] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Once softened, add your arborio rice and Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 1 min or until the Chinese rice wine has evaporated


### Step 4

Add the vegetable stock to the pan a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto


### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, chop your parsley & chives finely, including the stalks and grate your Italian hard cheese

Crumble your feta into rough bite-sized pieces, then chop your black olives finely

Combine the chopped olives in a bowl with half of your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a good grind of black pepper – this is your olive tapenade


### Step 6

Remove the base of your lettuce

Wash the lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves and add to a large bowl with the remaining red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a gentle mix – this is your dressed salad


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked through, add half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), chopped parsley & chives and crumbled feta to the risotto

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby feta risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Drizzle the olive tapenade over the herby feta risotto and top with a roasted whole tomato

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
