## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin


### Step 3

Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving 100ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> [200ml] </span>of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Add your panko breadcrumbs, walnuts and pine nuts to a food processor with the chopped shallot, crushed garlic, vegetable stock mix and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until you are left with a smooth paste – this is your walnut pesto

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!


### Step 5

Wash, then chop your cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Add the chopped cavolo nero to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the cavolo nero has wilted


### Step 6

Once wilted, add the walnut pesto to the pan with the reserved starchy pasta water


### Step 7

Add the drained tagliatelle to the pan with a knob of butter and give everything a good mix up – this is your fresh tagliatelle with walnut pesto & cavolo nero

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the fresh tagliatelle with walnut pesto & cavolo nero topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Garnish with a lemon wedge and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
