### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the grated ginger and grated garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1692025189502-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add your curry powder and ground turmeric to the onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add your tomato paste, most of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 1 min

Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to reduce – this is your Goan-style curry sauce

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1692025194520-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the curry sauce and cook for 2-3 min further or until slightly wilted

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1692025198278-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut your hake fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Place the chopped hake over the curry and cook, covered, for 6-7 min or until cooked through – this is your Goan-style hake & spinach curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks, then stir it through the basmati rice – this is your coriander rice

### Step 8

Serve the Goan-style hake & spinach curry over the coriander rice and garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
