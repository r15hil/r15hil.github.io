### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Heat a&nbsp;large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the bacon and cook for 2 min on each side or until crispy


Remove the bacon from the pan, roughly chop into small pieces and set aside &ndash; this is your bacon topping


### Step 2

Boil a kettle


Peel and chop&nbsp;the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Trim, then dice the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large pot with a drizzle of olive oil&nbsp;over a medium heat


Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened


Add the chopped courgette&nbsp;with half the&nbsp;chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2 min further


### Step 4

Dissolve the chicken&nbsp;stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span>&nbsp;boiled water


Add the chicken&nbsp;stock, cannellini beans and kale to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 min &ndash; this is your vegetable &amp; bean soup


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the basil leaves&nbsp;to a pestle &amp; mortar with the&nbsp;remaining&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;(Don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and grind to a smooth&nbsp;paste


Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil and give it a good mix up


Tip: if you don't have a pestle &amp; mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with olive oil


### Step 6

Grate the cheddar cheese


Add the grated cheese to the&nbsp;basil paste and give everything a good mix up&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this is your pistou


### Step 7

Add the ciabatta rolls&nbsp;to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the vegetable &amp; bean soup with a spoonful of the pistou, topped with the crispy bacon and the ciabatta rolls&nbsp;on the side


Enjoy!
