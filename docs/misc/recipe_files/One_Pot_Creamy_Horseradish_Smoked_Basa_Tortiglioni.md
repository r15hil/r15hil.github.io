## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-<span class="text-danger"> </span>10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Add the chopped onion and crushed garlic to the dish


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your smoked basa into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> flour and the chopped basa to the dish with your horseradish cream, Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock mix, tortiglioni, a small pinch of salt and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Nestle the pasta into the water as much as you can, then stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 6

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!


### Step 7

Once the pasta is nearly cooked, chop your dill roughly, including the stalks

Once cooked, remove the dish from the oven and add the spinach, double cream and most of the chopped dill (save some for garnish!) and gently stir until the spinach starts to wilt and the fish is cooked through – this is your one-pot creamy horseradish smoked basa tortiglioni

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot creamy horseradish smoked basa tortiglioni and garnish with the remaining chopped dill and a crack of black pepper

Dig in!
