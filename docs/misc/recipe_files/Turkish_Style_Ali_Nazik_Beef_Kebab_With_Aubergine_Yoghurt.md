### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways (including the stalk), then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

Add the aubergine halves to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until very tender – this is your roasted aubergine

### Step 2

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pot (with a lid) over a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the white long grain rice, 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef mince and cook for 5-7 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the diced onion, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), season with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the ras el hanout, tomato paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 4-5 min or until thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Turkish-style ali nazik beef kebab

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1685091541060-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the aubergine is very tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skins with a fork, discard the skins

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily

Chop the scooped aubergine flesh finely

### Step 7

Add the chopped aubergine flesh to a bowl with the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together – this is your aubergine yoghurt

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 8

Serve the Turkish-style ali nazik beef kebab on top of the aubergine yoghurt with the cumin rice to one side

Garnish with the chopped mint

Enjoy!
