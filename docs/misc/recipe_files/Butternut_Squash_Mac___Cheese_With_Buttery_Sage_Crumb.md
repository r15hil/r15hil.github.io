## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 2

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 3-4 min

After an initial 3-4 min, add your butternut squash cubes to the pot and cook for a final 8-12 min or until the macaroni and butternut squash are tender

Once tender, drain the macaroni and butternut squash, reserving a cup<span class="text-danger"> </span>of starchy pasta water and reserve the pot


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, your dried sage, a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

### Step 4

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Add the breadcrumbs to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden – this is your sage crumb


### Step 5

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and half your smoked salt (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender, golden and crisp – this is your smoky Tenderstem


### Step 6

Add the grated cheddar cheese to the reserved pot with your cornflour, umami seasoning, the remaining smoked salt  and a pinch of pepper and mix until the cheese is fully coated

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>milk to the pot with your dijon mustard and 25ml <span class="text-purple">[50ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>reserved starchy pasta water

Cook over a medium heat for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your cheesy sauce


### Step 7

Add the drained macaroni and butternut squash to the pot with your cheesy sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your butternut squash mac & cheese

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!


### Step 8

Serve the butternut squash mac & cheese with the smoky Tenderstem to the side and top with your sage crumb
