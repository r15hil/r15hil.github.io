## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 1 toasted sesame seed sachet (5g)
- 2 Maris Piper potatoes
- 5g chives
- 2 Marmite pots (16g)
- 1 pot of sour cream (100g)
- 1 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 120g traditional puff pastry
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Pierce the Maris Piper potatoes with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 6-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 mins or until cooked through and the skins are crispy


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic finely

Dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large pot with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 5-6 min until softened


### Step 4

While the onion is softening, grate the cheddar cheese

Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Unwrap the puff pastry and cut it into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> squares

Add the puff pastry squares to a tray lined with non-stick baking paper and cut a diagonal slice in each corner (don't cut all the way to the centre!)


### Step 5

Spread each square with the Marmite then top with the sliced spring onion and half of the grated cheese

Fold every other corner into the centre until you have a pinwheel shape

Top each pinwheel with the remaining cheddar cheese and the sesame seeds

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 8-10 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your cheesy Marmite pinwheels


### Step 6

Once the baked potatoes are cooked through and crisp, add them to the pot with the onions and break them up with a wooden spoon to mash them slightly

Add the chopped garlic and another knob of butter and cook for 1-2 min until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Stir half the sour cream (save the rest for later!) through the soup and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your baked potato soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the baked potato soup in bowls and swirl through the remaining sour cream

Snip the chives over the soup with scissors and drizzle over a little olive oil

Serve the cheesy Marmite pinwheels to the side

Enjoy!
