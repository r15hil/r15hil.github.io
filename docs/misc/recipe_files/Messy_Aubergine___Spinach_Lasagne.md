## Ingredients

- Spinach (80g)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Red onion
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Lasagne sheets (120g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Aubergine
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut into quarters lengthways, then slice finely


### Step 2

Break your lasagne sheets into medium-sized pieces

Add the lasagne pieces to a pot of boiled water with a drizzle of olive oil, stirring to separate the pieces (this prevents them from sticking together!)

Cook for 5-7 min stirring occasionally, until slightly tender but not soft

Once done, drain the lasagne pieces, rinse under cold running water, gently separate the pieces, then leave to drain fully


### Step 3

While the lasagne pieces are cooking, reboil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [340ml]</span> boiled water

Stir in your tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, Henderson's Relish and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato stock

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced aubergine and cook for 6-8 min or until starting to soften

Once soft, add the chopped garlic, dried oregano, spinach and a splash of cold water to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until the spinach is beginning to wilt


### Step 6

Once the spinach has wilted, add the tomato stock and drained lasagne pieces to the pan and stir everything together

Bring to the the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 14-16 min or until the pasta is cooked and the sauce has thickened

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop the pasta from sticking together!

Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high


### Step 7

Drain your mozzarella and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Once the pasta is cooked, add the torn mozzarella to the pan, then top with your grated Italian hard cheese and put the pan under the grill for 3-4 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your messy aubergine & spinach lasagne

Tip: Keep the pan handle outside of the grill if it's plastic!

### Step 8

Leave the messy aubergine & spinach lasagne to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
