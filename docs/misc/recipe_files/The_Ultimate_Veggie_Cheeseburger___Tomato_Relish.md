## Ingredients

- 3 white potatoes
- 32g tomato paste 
- 2 ultimate vegan burger patties
- 1 gem lettuce
- 2 butter brioche buns
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 1 garlic clove
- 5g rosemary
- 1 shallot
- 1 tomato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips and add to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Strip the rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Sprinkle the chopped rosemary all over the chips and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 in or until crisp – these are your rosemary chips


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Heat a pot with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to break down

Whilst the tomatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Add the chopped garlic and tomato paste to the pot and cook for 30 secs further

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water with the balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 5-6 min or until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce is the consistency of ketchup – this is your tomato relish


### Step 4

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Add the meat-free burger patties to one side of the tray and put in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 5

Whilst everything is in the oven, remove 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> outer leaves from the gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop the inner core<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into quarters

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rounds

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Once the patties have had 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and top them with the grated cheese - these are your cheesy meat-free patties


### Step 7

Add the brioche buns to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 8

Assemble your warmed brioche buns with a dollop of tomato relish, the gem leaves, cheesy meat-free patties and shallot rounds - these are your ultimate veggie cheeseburgers

Serve the ultimate veggie cheeseburgers with the rosemary chips, gem quarters and any remaining tomato relish to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
