## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potatoes<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped sweet potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 2 min or until starting to soften

Add your lamb mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, and cook for a further 4-5 min or until starting to brown

Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle


### Step 5

Add your baharat and your chicken stock mix to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add your sultanas, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and the chopped mint and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce thickens into a gravy-like consistency and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Moroccan-style spiced lamb


### Step 6

Once the sweet potatoes are cooked, mash them with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Transfer the Moroccan-style spiced lamb to an oven-proof dish and top evenly with the sweet potato mash

Sprinkle your panko breadcrumbs and ground sumac over the top

Place the dish in the oven and cook for 15-20 min until golden brown – this is your Moroccan-style spiced lamb shepherd's pie


### Step 7

Just before serving, mix your balsamic vinegar, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add it to the dressing, then give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style spiced lamb shepherd's pie with the salad to the side

Enjoy!
