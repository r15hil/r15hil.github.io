### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your salmon fillet[s] and pour over your soy sauce

### Step 3

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika and ground allspice over the fish and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through and blackened

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 4

While the fish is cooking, drain and roughly chop your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 5

Add the chopped pineapple, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander to a bowl and gently mix it all together – this is your speedy pineapple salsa

### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs or until warmed through

While the tortillas are in the microwave, combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your mayo, a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water in a bowl – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 7

Once the salmon is cooked, peel off and discard the skin

Break the cooked salmon apart into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and remove from the heat – these are your blackened salmon chunks

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the blackened salmon chunks, speedy pineapple salsa and shredded lettuce

Dollop over the chipotle mayo

Enjoy!
