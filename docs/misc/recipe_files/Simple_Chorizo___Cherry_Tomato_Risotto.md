## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 2

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1 min or until beginning to soften slightly


### Step 4

Add your diced chorizo to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add the chopped garlic, chopped thyme, ground smoked paprika and half of your chopped cherry tomatoes (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and mix well


### Step 5

Add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Add the remaining chopped cherry tomatoes when the rice is nearly cooked – this is your chorizo & cherry tomato risotto


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat then add your grated Italian hard cheese and a knob of butter and stir through

Taste for seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo & cherry tomato risotto in a bowl with the salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining spring onion

Enjoy!
