## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the wedges are golden and starting to crisp – these are your potato wedges


### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, slice your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice the halves into wedges


### Step 3

Add the red wine vinegar, mustard seeds, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar, a splash of boiled water and a pinch of salt to a bowl and stir until dissolved

Add the cucumber wedges to the bowl and give everything a good mix up, then set aside – these are your quick-pickled cucumber wedges

Tip: Give the cucumber the occasional shake while pickling!


### Step 4

Line a separate baking tray with tin foil

Add your meat-free patties to one side of the tray (or two!) and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Combine your mayo, ketchup and mustard ketchup in a bowl – this is your special sauce

Slice your brioche buns in half

Drain the quick-pickled cucumber wedges and discard the liquid


### Step 7

Once the meat-free patties have cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray

Top the meat-free patties with the grated cheese and return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven for 3-4 min or until the brioche buns are warmed through and the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy veggie patties

### Step 8

To assemble, spread the special sauce onto each warmed brioche base, then top with a cheesy veggie patty, a sprinkling of crispy onions and a warmed brioche lid – these are your American-style veggie cheeseburgers

Serve the potato wedges and quick-pickled cucumber wedges to the side

Enjoy!
