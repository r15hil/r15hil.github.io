### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, wash, then trim the base from your pak choi, then separate the individual leaves and discard the base

Trim your spring onion[s], then cut each spring onion into thirds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Combine your soy sauce, hoisin sauce and honey to a small bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your sticky sauce

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your hake fillet[s] and cook for an initial 3-4 min on one side

### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves, spring onion thirds and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until both have softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and toasted sesame oil and cook for 1 min further – this is your sesame pak choi & spring onions

### Step 6

After 3-4 min turn the hake fillet[s] and add the sticky sauce to the pan

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the hake is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a sticky consistency – these are your sticky Chinese-style hake fillet[s]

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Add your black sesame seeds to the basmati rice and fluff with a fork – this is your sesame rice

### Step 8

Serve the sticky Chinese-style hake fillet[s] over the sesame rice and drizzle with any remaining sticky sauce

Serve the sesame pak choi & spring onions to the side

Enjoy!
