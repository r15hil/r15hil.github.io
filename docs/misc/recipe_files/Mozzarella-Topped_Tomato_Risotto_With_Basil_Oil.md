### Step 6

Grind the chopped basil with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 3-4 tbsp olive oil or enough to loosen and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with salt and olive oil

Season the tomato risotto with salt and pepper

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the tomato risotto in bowls

Tear the mozzarella in half and nestle into the tomato risotto so that it melts nicely

Drizzle the basil oil over the top

Enjoy!
