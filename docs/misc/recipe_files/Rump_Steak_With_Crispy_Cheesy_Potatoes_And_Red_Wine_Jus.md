## Ingredients

- Fine green beans (160g)
- British rump pavé steak (150g) x0
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- Red wine paste (10g)
- British rump pavé steak (300g)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)
- White potato x3
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes in half, lengthways, then score the cut side in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way through


### Step 2

Add the halved potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12 min, then drain and rinse with cold water to cool them slightly (reserve the pot!)

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 3

While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper and add the grated Italian hard cheese with a generous drizzle of olive oil, the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of black pepper

Mix everything together until fully combined, being careful not to spread the mixture out too thin – this is your Italian cheese & garlic base


### Step 4

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides

Once cooked and slightly cooled, add the boiled potatoes to the Italian cheese & garlic base, cut side down

Drizzle over a little olive oil with a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the potatoes and cheese are golden and crispy


### Step 5

Meanwhile, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 220ml <span class="text-purple">[290ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[380ml] </span>boiled water

Add your red wine paste and beef stock mix with 3 tsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until reduced by half to a sauce-like consistency, then stir through a large knob of cold butter – this is your red wine jus


### Step 6

Trim your green beans

Add the trimmed green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a small knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel[s], then add<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a separate tray[s] and put it in the oven for 10-12 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once very hot, add the steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak[s] is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

### Step 8

Add any resting juices to the jus and mix everything together

Slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board

Serve the crispy cheesy potatoes with the green beans and sliced steak to the side

Drizzle over the red wine jus

Enjoy!
