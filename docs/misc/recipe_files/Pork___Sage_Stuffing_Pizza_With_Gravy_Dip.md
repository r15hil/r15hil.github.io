## Ingredients

- Dried sage (1tsp)
- Spinach (80g)
- Sausage meat (150g)
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Crispy onions (15g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Cranberry sauce (40g)
- Tomato paste (32g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with your dried sage and give everything a good mix up

Divide the mixture into 6 per person and roll into small meatballs


### Step 2

Combine your tomato paste with a generous drizzle of olive oil and 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Dissolve your beef stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 4

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add the pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato sauce on your pizza base[s] evenly with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella, piles of wilted spinach and the pork & sage stuffing balls


### Step 5

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the cheese has melted, the base is crisp and the pork & sage stuffing balls are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork & sage stuffing pizza[s]


### Step 6

Whilst the pizza[s] is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 7

Gradually whisk the beef stock into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your gravy dip

Tip: If your gravy isn't thickening, increase the heat to high and leave to bubble away!

### Step 8

Top the pork & sage stuffing pizza with dollops of your cranberry sauce and your crispy onions

Serve with the gravy dip in a bowl to the side

Enjoy!
