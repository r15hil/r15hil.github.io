### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (don't chop!) your ginger

Chop your meat-free chick'n into smaller, bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half 

Cut your cucumber[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 6

Combine the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced cucumber and carrot ribbons in a bowl along with half of the Vietnamese-style marinade and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

Add the remaining Vietnamese-style marinade and chopped meat-free chick'n to a bowl and mix to fully combine

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free chick'n along with any remaining Vietnamese-style marinade from the bowl and cook for 6-7 min or until warmed through and starting to brown – this is your Vietnamese-style meat-free chick'n

### Step 8

Serve the sticky rice with the Vietnamese-style meat-free chick'n on top and the crunchy salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Garnish with the chopped mint

Enjoy!
