### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into chunky chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until slightly softened

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil to a deep baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until the oil is hot

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Combine the chopped shallot with the mayo and the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir – this is your lemon mayo

### Step 3

Once done, drain the softened chunky chips and reserve the pot, give them a shake in the colander until the edges have fluffed up a little

Carefully remove the baking tray of hot oil from the oven and add the fluffed chunky chips

Season them with salt and turn them a few times until they're fully coated in the oil

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the Marmite and 80ml<span class="text-danger"> [160ml] </span>very cold water in a small bowl, stirring continuously until fully combined – this is your Marmite water

Add 60g <span class="text-danger">[120g] </span>flour to a separate large bowl with half of the red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), a generous pinch of salt and the Marmite water

Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no lumps, then set aside for later – this is your batter

### Step 5

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and cut each fillet in half on a diagonal

Season the basa with a pinch of salt and sprinkle both sides with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

Reboil a kettle

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, dip the floured basa into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated, then add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your battered fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Add the blanched peas to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter

Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your mushy peas

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the battered fish with the chunky chips and mushy peas to the side

Sprinkle the chips with the remaining red wine vinegar – these are your salt & vinegar chips

Serve with the ketchup and lemon mayo to the side for dipping, and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
