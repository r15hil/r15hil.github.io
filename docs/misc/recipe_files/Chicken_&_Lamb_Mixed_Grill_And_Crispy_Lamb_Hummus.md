### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Combine your baharat and half your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with a little drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt, then cut your chicken thighs into strips

### Step 2

Add the chicken strips to the bowl, give everything a good mix up and thread the chicken strips evenly onto each skewer and transfer to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Combine 3/4 of your lamb mince (you'll use the rest later!) and your mint sauce in a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a pinch of pepper

Divide and shape the lamb mixture into 1 long, flat sausage per person, then add to the baking tray[s] – these are your minted lamb kebabs

### Step 3

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 16-18 min, turning once halfway, or until everything is cooked through and slightly charred (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken & lamb mixed grill kebabs

Meanwhile, peel and grate your garlic

Combine your mayo and half of the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a bowl with a small splash of cold water – this is your garlic sauce

### Step 4

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Combine the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato[es] in a bowl with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a little drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato salad

### Step 5

Drain and rinse your chickpeas, then add the remaining grated garlic to a food processor with the tahini and half the drained chickpeas

Add 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water, a generous pinch of salt and the remaining lemon juice and blitz until smooth – this is your hummus

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-copy-1650385891939-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the remaining lamb mince and cook for 4 min or until brown and beginning to crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 3-4 min further or until slightly crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy lamb

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1650385898670-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

When everything is almost ready, add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until golden and crisp

Once done, chop the toasted pittas in half

Top the hummus with the crispy lamb – this is your crispy lamb hummus

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & lamb mixed grill kebabs with the tomato salad, toasted pitta halves and the crispy lamb hummus to the side

Drizzle the garlic sauce over the kebabs

Enjoy!
