### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Zest your lemon[s], then slice off 2 rounds per person (save the rest for later)

Add the lemon zest to a small bowl with your cracked black pepper and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your lemon pepper rub

### Step 2

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] and potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add all of the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot with a small knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth, then set aside (this can be quickly reheated before serving) – this is your sweet potato mash

### Step 3

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, slice through the thickest part of your chicken breast portion[s], being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side, then open it out like a book – this is your butterflied chicken

Stuff the butterflied chicken with 2 lemon rounds, then add to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!), then add a drizzle of vegetable oil and coat the chicken with the lemon pepper rub, then put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lemon pepper chicken

### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the remaining lemon to the pan (cut side down!) for 3-4 min or until the flesh has charred and caramelised

Once charred, remove from the heat and slice in half – these are your charred lemon wedges

Set the charred lemon wedges aside and reserve the pan

### Step 5

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of sugar to the pan, reduce the heat to very low and cook for 7-8 min or until softened and caramelised

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 6

Whilst the onion is softening, wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the sliced spring greens to the pan with a grind of black pepper and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your caramelised onion greens

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1652183462811-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whilst the greens are cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix, Chinese rice wine and soy sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Heat a pot over a medium heat and once hot, add 15g<span class="text-purple"> [25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter, then once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs until a sandy paste has formed

Whisk in the stock and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally – this is your gravy

### Step 8

Serve the lemon pepper chicken with the sweet potato mash and the caramelised onion greens to the side

Tip: Remove the lemon rounds from the chicken as these will be bitter!

Drizzle the gravy all over and garnish with the charred lemon wedges

Enjoy!
