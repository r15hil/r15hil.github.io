## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly golden


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Add your chopped tomatoes and chicken stock mix to the pan, then reduce the heat to medium and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 10-15 min or until the tomatoes have reduced to the consistency of a thick sauce and the chicken is cooked (no pink meat!) – this is your tomato & chicken sauce


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your linguine to a large pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt over a high heat

Bring to the boil and cook for 8-10 min, or until cooked with a slight bite


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Add the spinach to the linguine and cook for 30 secs or until the spinach has wilted, then drain, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water, and return to the pot

Once the tomato sauce has thickened, add the drained linguine & spinach to the pan with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar, a very generous pinch of salt and a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up until the linguine is coated in the sauce – this is your tangy tomato & chicken linguine

### Step 8

Serve the tangy tomato & chicken linguine and sprinkle over your black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
