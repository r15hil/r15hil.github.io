## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1

Wash your shredded kale

Add the shredded kale to a large baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until crispy – this is your crispy 'seaweed'


### Step 2

Combine your cornflour and Fable pulled mushrooms in a bowl with half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and mix it all together

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated Fable mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until browned – these are your crispy Fable mushrooms

Once browned, transfer to a plate with kitchen paper, reserve the pan


### Step 3

While the Fable mushrooms are browning, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal (peeling is optional)

Slice your red chilli[es] finely


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any remaining oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and carrot discs and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has softened and is starting to brown


### Step 6

Combine the remaining soy sauce and rice vinegar in a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, tomato ketchup, red chilli relish and sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli sauce

Once the onion is starting to brown, add the chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has slightly thickened


### Step 7

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add the crispy Fable mushrooms and stir it all together until everything is coated in sauce – these are your crispy chilli Fable mushrooms

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chilli Fable mushrooms with the basmati rice and crispy 'seaweed' to the side

Enjoy!
