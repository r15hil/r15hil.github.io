### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a small bowl with the chopped coriander and a drizzle of olive oil, then crumble in your Greek cheese and give everything a good mix up

Transfer the breadcrumb mix to a baking tray and put in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden, then allow to cool – this is your Greek cheese crumb

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add a drizzle of vegetable oil, your smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Drain and rinse your black beans

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans, a pinch of salt and 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[195ml] </span>[250ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil

Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the beans are beginning to soften

### Step 4

While the beans are cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Cut the lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into 2 wedges per person

Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and roughly chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 5

Combine your chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with your mayo, a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water in a small bowl – this is your garlic mayo

Combine the drained sweetcorn, chopped cherry tomatoes, sliced spring onion and the juice of half the lime wedges with a pinch of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil in a separate bowl – this is your corn salsa

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1636030656535-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1636030673800-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the black beans are beginning to break down, remove them from the heat and mash them into a semi-smooth paste, then add a knob of butter – these are your refried beans

Tip: If your beans are looking a little dry, add a splash of water

### Step 8

Top each warmed tortilla with the refried beans, corn salsa and Greek cheese crumb – these are your beany tacos

Drizzle with the garlic mayo and garnish with the remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!
