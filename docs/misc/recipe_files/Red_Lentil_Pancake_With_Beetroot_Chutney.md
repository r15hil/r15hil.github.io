### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the rinsed lentils to a heatproof bowl, cover them boiled water (just enough to cover them) and set aside for 15-20 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 2

While the lentils are softening, drain the beetroot in a sieve over the sink then grate and squeeze out any excess water

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

### Step 3

Add the grated beetroot to a medium sized pot with the chopped tomatoes, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tamarind paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of salt and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your beetroot chutney

### Step 4

While the chutney is cooking, drain and rinse the chickpeas

Add the drained chickpeas to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half the curry powder and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until crisp – these are your crispy curried chickpeas

### Step 5

Add the carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a large bowl with the sliced shallot, cider vinegar, ginger & garlic paste and chopped mint

Season with a generous pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and mix it all together – this is your ginger slaw

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1678466423289-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once softened, drain the soaked lentils

Add the drained lentils to a food processor with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and the remaining curry powder and blitz until smooth

Once smooth, transfer the lentil mixture to a bowl with half the chopped coriander and nigella seeds and mix until fully combined – this is your batter

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1678466427876-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, pour exactly 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1/4]</span> of the batter into the pan and tilt it in a circular motion so that the mixture spreads evenly over the base and cook for 3-4 min on each side<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until set

Transfer to a plate and cover with tin foil then repeat for the final 1 <span class="text-danger">[3] </span>pancake<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your red lentil pancakes

### Step 8

Serve the red lentil pancakes topped with the beetroot chutney, ginger slaw and crispy curried chickpeas

Drizzle the cultured coconut and garnish with the remaining coriander

Enjoy!
