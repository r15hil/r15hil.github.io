### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped garlic & ginger in a bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pork patties, press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Reduce the heat to medium-high, flip each patty and cook for a further 5 min or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

While the patties are cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Combine your rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a large bowl

Add your mooli slaw mix, chopped coriander and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your zingy slaw

### Step 6

Add your ciabatta[s] to a separate baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty

Carefully slice them in half before serving

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1684228939759-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine your mayo with your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

### Step 8

Spread each ciabatta base with a little sriracha mayo, then top with the pork burger, a handful of zingy slaw and a ciabatta lid – this is your fiery Vietnamese-style pork bánh-mì burger

Serve the fiery Vietnamese-style pork bánh-mì burger with the chips, remaining zingy slaw and remaining sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!
