## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain your tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the drained tofu into cubes


### Step 3

Once the pan is very hot, add the tofu cubes and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 4

While the tofu is cooking, add your mangetout to a large bowl and cover them in boiled water until fully submerged

Set aside to soften

In a small bowl combine your soy sauce, maple syrup and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your teriyaki glaze


### Step 5

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 6

Add the teriyaki glaze and half the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has coated the tofu nicely – this is your teriyaki tofu


### Step 7

Drain the softened mangetout and return to the bowl

Then add your toasted sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame greens

### Step 8

Serve the teriyaki tofu with the cooked rice and the sesame greens on the side

Garnish with the remaining spring onion

Enjoy!
