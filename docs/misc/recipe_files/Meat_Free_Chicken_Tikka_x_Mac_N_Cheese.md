## Ingredients

- 1 tsp garam masala
- 80g cheddar
- 1 gem lettuce
- 40g natural yoghurt
- 1 tomato
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1/2 tbsp curry powder
- 160g meat-free chick'n
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 150g macaroni
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add the macaroni to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the cooked macaroni reserving a cup of starchy pasta water and set aside until later, reserve the pot


### Step 2

While the macaroni is cooking, add the meat-free chicken bites to a large bowl with half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the natural yoghurt

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining natural yoghurt for another recipe!

Add the ground paprika, ground turmeric, garam masala, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then set aside – this is your meat-free chicken tikka


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Finley grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and chopped garlic with the curry powder and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the shallot – this is your roux


### Step 5

Gradually whisk 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, then cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once thickened, add 3/4 of the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), vegetable stock mix and a generous grind of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your curried béchamel sauce


### Step 6

Add the drained macaroni to the curried béchamel sauce – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry


### Step 7

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to an oven-proof dish and top with the remaining grated cheese, meat-free chicken tikka and nigella seeds

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your meat-free chicken tikka x mac 'n' cheese

Meanwhile, wash the gem lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Roughly chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

### Step 8

Season the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt then serve to the side

Enjoy!
