## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Finely slice 1/2 your red chilli[es] into rounds and set them aside for garnish

Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften and brown


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half, separating the tips from the stems

Sliced your sugar snap peas in half

Once the aubergine has softened, add your Thai green curry paste, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped ginger to the pan with the aubergine and cook for 2 min


### Step 5

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water

Add the juice of 1/2 your lime[s], your lime leaves and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix to combine – this is your aromatic stock


### Step 6

Add the aromatic stock to the pan with the Tenderstem broccoli stems and halved sugar snap peas, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 min

Add the Tenderstem broccoli tips and cook for 2 min further or until everything's tender with a slight bite and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your Thai green vegetable curry


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Thai green vegetable curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the roasted peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
