### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into wedges

### Step 2

Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Turn the wedges halfway through cooking to make sure they are browned all over!

Add the chopped parsley, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your chimichurri

Tip: Add a splash more olive oil if it looks a little dry!

Once the steak[s] is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar in a large bowl

Once ready to serve, add the salad and the halved tomatoes to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad

### Step 8

Once rested, slice the steak[s] on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak with the sweet potato wedges and tomato salad to the side

Drizzle the chimichurri all over the steak

Enjoy!
