## Ingredients

- 100g seedless grapes
- 2 truffle flavoured extra virgin olive oil sachets (16ml)
- 100g crème fraîche
- 35g Italian hard cheese
- 60g brie
- 70g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 2.5g cracked black pepper
- 190g linguine
- 50g rocket
- 3 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and half<span class="text-danger"> </span>of the truffle oil


### Step 2

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to turn very slightly golden

Once done, transfer to kitchen paper (use a fork to get them out of the oil) and set aside

Season with a pinch of salt – these are your truffled garlic crisps

Reserve the pan and the oil


### Step 3

Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 7-9 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

While the linguine is cooking, chop the brie into small pieces

Peel the Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Crumble the remaining Italian hard cheese


### Step 5

Chop the seedless grapes in half

Combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing


### Step 6

Once the linguine is cooked, return the reserved pan and oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the cracked black pepper and cook for 30 secs

Add 90ml <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water with the grated Italian hard cheese (and any crumbled Italian hard cheese), chopped brie and crème fraîche and cook for 2-3 min or until everything's melted and a cheese sauce has formed


### Step 7

Add the drained linguine with a generous pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your cheesy brie, black pepper & truffle linguine

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy brie, black pepper & truffle linguine topped with the cheese shavings and truffled garlic crisps

Drizzle the remaining truffle oil all over and season with a grind of black pepper

Toss the rocket and grapes together and drizzle with the balsamic dressing

Enjoy!
