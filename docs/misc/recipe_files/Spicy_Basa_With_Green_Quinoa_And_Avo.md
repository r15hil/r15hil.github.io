## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 15ml soy sauce
- 185g canned black beans
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 1 avocado
- 130g quinoa
- 10g coriander
- 80g baby leaf spinach
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 spring onions
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving


### Step 2

Add the smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice and soy sauce to a plate with a generous grind of pepper and mix it together to form a paste

Add the basa fillets to the paste and turn until well coated


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your spicy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Trim, then slice the spring onions

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 5

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach, chopped garlic and half of the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), half the sliced spring onions and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) to a food processor

Add the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt then blitz until smooth – this is your zingy spinach dressing


### Step 6

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways


### Step 7

Drain and rinse the black beans

Once the quinoa is cooked, add the drained black beans and a dollop of the zingy spinach dressing and stir it all together – this is your green quinoa

### Step 8

Serve the spicy basa over the green quinoa with the sliced avocado to the side

Drizzle over the remaining zingy spinach dressing

Garnish with the reserved sliced spring onions, chilli rounds and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
