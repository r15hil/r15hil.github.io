### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, wash, then trim the base from your pak choi, then separate the individual leaves and discard the base

Trim your spring onions, then cut each spring onion into thirds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Combine your soy sauce, hoisin sauce and honey to a bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your sticky sauce

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your basa fillet[s] and cook for an initial 3-4 min on one side

### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves, spring onion thirds and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until both have softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and your toasted sesame oil and cook for 1 min further – this is your sesame pak choi & spring onions

### Step 6

After 3-4 min turn the basa fillet[s] and add the sticky sauce to the pan

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the basa is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a sticky consistency – this is your sticky Chinese-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Add your black sesame seeds to the basmati rice and fluff with a fork – this is your sesame rice

### Step 8

Serve the sticky Chinese-style basa over the sesame rice and drizzle with any remaining sticky sauce

Serve the sesame pak choi & spring onions to the side

Enjoy!
