## Instructions


### Step 1

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and set aside


### Step 4

Once golden, add the chopped pepper to the pan with the meat-free chick'n

Add your ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min further or until the pepper is beginning to soften


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce with your toasted sesame oil and honey in a bowl – this is your stir-fry sauce


### Step 6

Once the meat-free chick'n is warmed through, rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water, then add to the pan and cook for 30 secs


### Step 7

Add the drained noodles with the stir-fry sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further, stirring until the sauce sticks to the noodles – this is your simply delicious meat-free chick'n stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Serve the simply delicious meat-free chick'n stir-fry
