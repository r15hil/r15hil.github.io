Once the rice is almost cooked, add the asparagus tips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until bright green and tender with a bite – these are your roasted asparagus tips

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] and the grated cheese and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your asparagus & chicken risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Drizzle with some olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
