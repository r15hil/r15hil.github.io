## Description

This wholesome dish is bursting with flavour. It’s influenced by fattoush, a Levantine salad with a tangy dressing that’s traditionally soaked up with torn bread – but here with tasty sumac pitta chips! There’s plenty of protein from spicy roasted chickpeas, paired with a cooling garlic and dill yoghurt.
