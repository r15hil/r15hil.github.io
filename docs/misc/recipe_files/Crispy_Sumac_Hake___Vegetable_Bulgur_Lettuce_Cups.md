## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Gem lettuce
- Tomato x2
- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- Hake fillets (2pcs)
- Ground sumac (1tsp)
- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Bulgur wheat (130g)
- Parsley & dill (10g)
- Shallot
- Garlic clove
- Red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 230°C/ 210°C (fan)/ gas 7, then deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the pepper strips, tomato wedges and garlic (skin on) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground coriander, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt


### Step 2

Boil a kettle, then put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the pepper is charred

Whilst the vegetables are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely then, add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle– this is your quick-pickled shallot

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, remove 3 outer leaves for per person and set aside, then shred the inner core


### Step 3

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks, then finely chop your dill

Add your bulgur wheat and your vegetable stock mix to a pot with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour with half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt in a large bowl

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Pat the chopped hake dry with kitchen paper, then add to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the chopped hake is fully coated


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side, or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy sumac hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Whilst the hake is cooking, add the chopped dill to a small bowl with your mayo and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your dill mayo


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are cooked, remove the tray from the oven and carefully remove the skin[s] from your roasted garlic (this will be hot!), then chop roughly

Fluff the drained bulgur with a fork

Combine the roasted vegetables and chopped roasted garlic with the cooked bulgur, then add the chopped parsley and stir everything together – this is your roasted vegetable bulgur

### Step 8

Load the lettuce leaves with the roasted vegetable bulgur, shredded lettuce, and the crispy sumac hake

Drizzle over the dill mayo and top with quick-pickled shallot

Sprinkle the remaining ground sumac all over

Enjoy!
