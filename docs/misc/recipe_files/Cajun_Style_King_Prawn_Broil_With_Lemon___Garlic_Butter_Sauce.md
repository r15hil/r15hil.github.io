### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Zest the lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half
