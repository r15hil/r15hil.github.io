## Ingredients

- 1 Sriracha hot chilli sauce sachet (8ml)
- 1 soy sauce sachet (15ml)
- 1 rice vinegar sachet (30ml)
- 1 fish sauce sachet (15ml)
- 320g British chicken thighs
- 1 fresh lemongrass
- 130g basmati rice
- 125g radishes
- 5g mint
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 lime
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high


Slice the radishes (as finely as you can)


Add the sliced radish to a bowl with the rice vinegar and a small splash of cold water


Mix it together and set aside to pickle


### Step 2

<span class="text-highlight">Remove</span> the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of the lemongrass and set aside for later


Chop the softer inner core roughly


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop the ginger


Peel and roughly chop the garlic


Peel and roughly chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Add the chopped lemongrass, ginger, garlic and onion to a food processor with the fish sauce, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a very generous grind of pepper


Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and whizz until a paste has formed – this is your marinade


### Step 4

Cut the chicken thighs into large pieces


Combine the chicken with the marinade and set aside


### Step 5

Add the basmati rice, outer lemongrass layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Add the chicken and any remaining marinade to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Put the tray under the grill for 10 min, turning the tray once half way, until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Vietnamese-style lemongrass chicken


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the Sriracha hot chilli sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the soy sauce, remaining lime juice, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil – this is your dipping sauce


Pick the mint leaves from their stalks and chop them roughly, discard the stalks


Tip: Once the chicken is cooked, add any juices from the tray to the dipping sauce!

### Step 8

Serve the Vietnamese-style lemongrass chicken with the pickled radishes<span class="text-highlight">, cooked rice</span> and dipping sauce to the side


Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Garnish with the chopped mint


Enjoy!
