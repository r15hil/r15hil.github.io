## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine your toasted sesame oil and half of your tamari soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar, ground coriander, a knob of butter and a grind of black pepper – this is your sesame marinade

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] in half then add it to the sesame marinade


### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into quarters

Add the pepper quarters, with hollow of the pepper facing up to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and top each quarter with the marinated chicken

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet sesame chicken breast & charred green pepper


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Add the basmati rice, hoisin sauce, Chinese rice wine, ginger & garlic paste and the remaining tamari soy sauce to the dish and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add your chicken stock mix with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the rice is cooked, stir the spinach through until wilted and give everything a good mix up – this is your hoisin rice

### Step 8

Serve the sweet sesame chicken breast & charred pepper over the hoisin rice

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and drizzle over any remaining juices from the chicken

Dig in!
