### Step 2

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 6-7 min

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 3

While the pasta is cooking, melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and chopped garlic and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

### Step 4

Gradually whisk 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce

Add your vegetable stock mix and half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) to the béchamel sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheese sauce

### Step 5

Remove the pot from the heat and stir your garden veg mix and drained farfalle through the cheese sauce with the drained tuna and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>reserved starchy pasta water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tuna pasta mix

### Step 6

Add your panko breadcrumbs and remaining grated cheese to a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy crunchy topping

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1697645679453-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Top the tuna pasta mix evenly with the cheesy crunchy topping

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your creamy tuna pasta bake

### Step 8

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the creamy tuna pasta bake

Enjoy!
