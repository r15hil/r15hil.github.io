- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C / 425&deg;F/ Gas 7&nbsp;


Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice into rounds


Trim, then slice the&nbsp;courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Add the leek and courgette to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;then put the tray in the oven for an initial 10-15 min or until step 3


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Add the wheat berries to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)


Cook over a high heat for 10-12 min


Once cooked, drain and set aside


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Meanwhile, place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces


Remove the tray of vegetables from the oven and add the chicken


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and return the tray to the oven for 15 min or until everything's cooked&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, re-boil a kettle


Chop the&nbsp;parsley&nbsp;finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Add the&nbsp;chopped parsley&nbsp;to a pestle &amp; mortar with the&nbsp;capers, 2 tbsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]&nbsp;</span>warm water&nbsp;and a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt


Grind to a paste, then add 1 tbsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]&nbsp;</span>olive oil&nbsp;and mix to combine &ndash; this is your&nbsp;salsa verde&nbsp;


### Step 5

Cut the&nbsp;green beans&nbsp;in half&nbsp;


Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;


Dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in 500ml<span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 sec or until fragrant&nbsp;


Add the chicken stock,&nbsp;wholegrain mustard and the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 7

Once boiling, add the green beans to the broth and cook for 2 min or until tender&nbsp;


Add the drained wheat berries&nbsp;and the roasted vegetables&nbsp;to the pan


Season with a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;and give everything a gentle mix up &ndash; this is your&nbsp;wheat berry broth&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Slice the chicken finely and cut the remaining lemon into wedges


Serve the&nbsp;wheat berry broth in bowls topped with the sliced chicken


Drizzle the salsa verde over the chicken and garnish with a wedge of lemon&nbsp;


Enjoy!
