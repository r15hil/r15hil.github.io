## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised – this is your caramelised onion


### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper, remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside and chop the inner core[s] into wedges

Grate your mature cheddar style block[s]

Combine the grated cheeze with your cornflour and a pinch of salt in a pot and mix until the cheeze is fully coated

Add your mustard ketchup and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk to the pot and set aside for later – this is your cheeze sauce base


### Step 4

Combine your meat-free patty[ies] and your ground smoked paprika in a bowl with your Henderson's Relish and a pinch of salt

Mix until combined, then divide and shape them into 2 meatballs per person (clean hands is the best way!)

Cover the meatballs with a sheet of baking paper and roll the meatballs out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your patties


### Step 5

Once the onion is caramelised, transfer to a plate (reserve the pan!) and set aside until serving

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties, press them down very firmly with a spatula and cook for 2-3 min on each side, pressing down continuously, or until slightly charred – these are your plant-based smashed patties


### Step 6

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] with the fries from the oven and add the brioche halves

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Heat the pot with your cheeze sauce base over a medium heat

Cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheeze has melted and thickened – this is your cheeze sauce

### Step 8

Build your burger by topping the warmed brioche base with your tomato ketchup, a lettuce leaf, 2 plant-based smashed patties, a dollop of cheeze sauce, the caramelised onion and the warmed brioche lid – this is your plant-based smashed patty burger

Serve the lettuce wedges and fries to the side, drizzle over the remaining cheeze sauce and top with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
