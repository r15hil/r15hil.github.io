### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pierce your sweet potato[es] with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 5-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the softened sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the skin is crispy

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely (including the stalks)

Boil half a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once the onion is starting to soften, add your lean beef mince to the pan with the chopped garlic and cook for 4 min further, or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further

Add the drained black beans, beef stock and chopped tomatoes and cook over a low heat for 15-20 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)– this is your lean chilli con carne

Mix the juice of half your lime[s] with your smashed avocado
