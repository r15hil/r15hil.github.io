## Ingredients

- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- British chicken breast strips (250g)
- British chicken breast strips (125g) x0
- Red Thai curry paste (20g)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Carrot
- Soy sauce (8ml) x2
- Red chilli
- Lime
- Roasted peanuts (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, boil a kettle then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips and cook for 2 min on each side or until golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and add your soy sauce – this is your coconut stock

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 3

Once the chicken is browned, add your red Thai curry paste and chopped ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock with a pinch of sugar and cook, covered, for a further 5 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the stock has thickened – this is your Thai-style coconut sauce


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your cucumber into disks, then slice each individual cucumber disk into matchsticks

Cut your lime[s] in half

Add the grated carrot and cucumber matchsticks to a large bowl

Add the juice of half your lime[s], your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt to the bowl and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your cucumber & carrot salad


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your roasted peanuts coarsely


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, reduce the heat to low and transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling'

Squeeze juice of the remaining lime into the Thai-style coconut sauce

Return the pulled chicken to the Thai-style coconut sauce and mix until the chicken is fully coated in sauce – this is your Thai-style coconut chicken


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed

### Step 8

To build, divide the cucumber & carrot salad between the warmed tortillas

Top with the Thai-style coconut chicken – these are your zingy Thai-style coconut chicken wraps

Garnish with the chopped chilli (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped roasted peanuts

Enjoy!
