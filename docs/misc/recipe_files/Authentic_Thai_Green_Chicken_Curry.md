## Ingredients

- 2 dried kaffir lime leaves
- 
- 1 flecked coconut cream sachet (50g)
- 10g fresh coriander
- 
- 4 British chicken thigh fillets
- 130g basmati rice
- 
- 
- 
- 1 lime 
- 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the basmati rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut the chicken thigh fillets into thin strips 


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the chicken strips and cook them for 5-7 min or until golden 


Once done, transfer the golden chicken to a plate and keep the pan for later


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, discarding the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut into small bite-size pieces 


Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic 


Slice the sugar snap peas in half lengthways


Boil a kettle


### Step 4

Return the pan to a high heat


Once hot, add the chopped aubergine with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until everything's browned slightly


### Step 5

Meanwhile, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly 


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Combine the coconut cream with 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> boiled water - this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Once the aubergine has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the Thai green curry paste and chopped garlic 


Cook for 1 min, then return the golden chicken to the pan with the coconut stock, kaffir lime leaves and fish sauce 


Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 5-6 min, then add the sliced sugar snaps and cook for 1 min further or until tender with a bite


### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lime into wedges


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!) 


Trim, then slice the spring onions finely 


Once cooked, stir through 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk (this loosens the curry slightly and adds extra creaminess!) and the chopped coriander - this is your Thai green chicken curry

### Step 8

Serve the Thai green chicken curry over the cooked rice 


Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Garnish with the spring onion, coriander leaves and a wedge of lime and enjoy!
