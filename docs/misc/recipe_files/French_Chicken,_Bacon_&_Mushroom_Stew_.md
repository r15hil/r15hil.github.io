# French Chicken, Bacon & Mushroom Stew 

NOTICE: All of these recipes have been retrieved from the Gousto API. I do not claim ownership of any recipes in these files. These recipes are provided for informational purposes only, based on publicly available data from Gousto.

## Description

This dish is inspired by the classic Coq au Vin, combining chicken and smoked bacon, braised in a full-bodied sauce with caramelised shallot, leek and baby chestnut mushrooms. You'll swap the more traditional red wine with Shaoxing wine, to give the dish a lighter feel without losing flavour. Served over parsley mash. C'est d√©licieux!
