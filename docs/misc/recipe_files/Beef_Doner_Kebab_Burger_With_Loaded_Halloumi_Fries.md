## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and grate half your red onion[s], then finely slice the remaining red onion

Combine the sliced onion and red wine vinegar in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> boiled water – this is your quick-pickled onion


### Step 2

Add the grated onion and beef mince to a bowl with your ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a pinch of salt and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)


### Step 3

Cut 2 A3 size sheets of non-stick baking paper

Put the beef mixture between the two sheets and using a rolling pin, roll it out until approx. the thickness of a pound coin

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Peel off the top baking sheet and transfer the rolled beef to a large baking tray (or two!) then add the tray[s] to the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Slice half your tomatoes<span class="text-danger"> </span>thinly, then chop the remaining tomato[es] roughly

Slice your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>outer leaf per person from the lettuce and set aside, shred the inner core[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Slice your halloumi into chips

Add the remaining ground smoked paprika to a plate with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour

Add the halloumi chips to the plate and turn several times until fully coated in the flour mix

Combine your roasted garlic paste, natural yoghurt and chopped coriander in a small bowl – this is your garlic sauce


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crispy – these are your halloumi fries

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Once golden, transfer the halloumi fries to kitchen paper to drain off any excess oil


### Step 7

Once the beef is nearly ready, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut side up, and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Once the beef has browned, remove from the oven and pat dry with kitchen paper

Slice the browned beef into long strips – this is your beef doner meat

### Step 8

Fill the brioche bun with beef doner meat, a gem leaf, sliced tomato, some quick-pickled onion and garlic sauce – this is your beef doner kebab burger

Top the halloumi fries with your mustard ketchup, sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the remaining garlic sauce and quick-pickled onion – these are your loaded halloumi fries

Serve the shredded lettuce with the chopped tomato and drizzle over the remaining pickling liquid and enjoy!
