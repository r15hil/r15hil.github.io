Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your waxy potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until starting to brown

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of pepper

Squeeze the halved tomatoes together with the torn ciabatta so that the juice soaks into the ciabatta – this is your marinated ciabatta

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 15 min or until the potatoes and the marinated ciabatta is golden and crispy – these are your roasted potatoes and tomato & chorizo croutons

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don’t burn!
