## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 2 tomatoes
- 20g mint sauce
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 2 plain naans
- 4 Proper Porker sausages
- 2 white potatoes
- 10g coriander
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Chop the tomatoes into wedges


### Step 2

Line a baking tray with tin foil (or two!)

Add the chopped potatoes and tomato wedges to one side of the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Sprinkle over the ground coriander with a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 3

Add the sausages to the other side of the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through


### Step 4

While the sausages and potatoes are in the oven, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 5

Add most of the chopped coriander (save a little for later!), the chopped garlic and the chopped ginger (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a small bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up

Add the white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of sugar and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney


### Step 6

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and combine it with the remaining chopped coriander – this is your shallot salad

Combine the mayo and mint sauce with a splash of cold water in a small bowl– this is your mint mayo

When your sausages are almost ready, add the naans to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot


### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 8

Mix the roasted tomatoes and potatoes together on the tray and slice the cooked sausages in half lengthways on a clean chopping board

Top the warmed naan with the halved sausages and a fried egg, then dollop over the mint mayo and shallot salad

Serve the roasted tomatoes & potatoes to the side and drizzle the coriander chutney all over

Enjoy!
