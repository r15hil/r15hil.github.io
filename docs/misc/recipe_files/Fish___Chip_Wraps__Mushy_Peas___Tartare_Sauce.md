## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (30ml)
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 6 plain tortillas
- 2 white potatoes
- 160g blanched peas
- 5g dill
- 200g haddock bites
- 15g capers
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are in the oven, slice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon to a bowl with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up until the lemon and oil have combined – this is your lemon & olive oil mix


### Step 3

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Coat the haddock bites in the lemon & olive oil mix, then roll them on the plate of breadcrumbs to coat everything evenly


### Step 4

Add the breadcrumbed haddock bites to a tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the fish is cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, slice the remaining lemon into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wedges

Chop the dill roughly


### Step 5

Add the blanched peas to a bowl and microwave for 1 min, or until hot and cooked with a bite

Add the cooked peas to a food processor along with a knob of butter, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water, the chopped dill, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Pulse until blitzed but not smooth – these are your mushy peas


### Step 6

Chop the capers roughly

Add the chopped capers to a bowl with the mayo and a generous grind of black pepper

Squeeze in the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and stir it all together – this is your tartare sauce


### Step 7

Add the tortilla wraps to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

### Step 8

Spread a dollop of mushy peas on the base of each warmed tortilla

Divide the chips and crispy haddock bites evenly between them

Spoon over the tartare sauce

Enjoy!
