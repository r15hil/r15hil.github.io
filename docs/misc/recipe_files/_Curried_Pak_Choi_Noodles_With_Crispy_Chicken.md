## Ingredients

- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 200g pak choi
- 2 fine egg noodle nests
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 4 tbsp cornflour
- 80g baby leaf spinach
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 2 garlic cloves
- 8ml soy sauce
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Add the diced chicken thigh to a bowl with the soy sauce and mix everything together

Add the cornflour and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

Set the bowl aside for later


### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and half the dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened


### Step 4

While the garlic and ginger is softening, dissolve the chicken stock mix and creamed coconut in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the curry powder to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the coconut stock with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil

Once boiling, turn the heat down to very low and cook for 7-8 min – this is your curry sauce


### Step 5

While the sauce is cooking, heat a separate pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash then cut the pak choi in half, separating the white bases and green tops

Set the green pak choi tops aside and cut the white pak choi bases into bite-sized pieces

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Increase the heat to medium-high for the curry sauce and add the fine egg noodles

Stir the noodles for 10 secs to separate them, then add the spinach and all of the pak choi to the pan with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the noodles are tender and sauce has slightly reduced – these are your curried pak choi noodles

### Step 8

Chop the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the curried pak choi noodles in bowls and top with the crispy chicken

Tear the coriander all over and garnish with a lime wedge and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
