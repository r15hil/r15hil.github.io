## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel your red onion[s] and slice into rings, 1 per person, then dice the remaining onion’

Add the onion rings and red wine vinegar to a shallow bowl and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled red onion rings


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened


### Step 3

Chop your coriander as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>cold water and the chopped coriander – this is your herby mayo


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the chopped garlic and your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce, then cook for a further 8-10 min or until the pork mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to crisp – this is your smoky lean pork mince


### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then separate the outer lettuce leaves and finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain and finely dice your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa


### Step 6

Add the tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Drain the quick-pickled red onion rings and discard the vinegar

### Step 8

Top your warmed tortillas with a dollop of herby mayo and the lettuce leaves

Spoon over the smoky lean pork mince, top with pineapple salsa and garnish with the quick-pickled red onion rings – these are your smoky lean pork, pineapple & red onion tacos

Enjoy!
