## Ingredients

- 0 mayonnaise
- 1 basa fillet
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 160g blanched peas
- 2 carrots
- 5g chives
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives with your panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt in a small bowl

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and stir it together until all of the breadcrumbs are coated in the oil – this is your chive crumb


### Step 3

Add your basa fillet[s] to a separate baking tray (or two!) and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Top the fish evenly with the chive crumb and press it into the fish using the back of a spoon

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your breaded fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

While the fish is cooking, combine a squeeze of lemon juice with your mayo in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemony mayo

Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons to a pot with a lid, with plenty of boiling water over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3 min


### Step 6

Add your blanched peas and cook for 2 min further or until everything's tender

Once done, drain the vegetables and return them to the pot with a knob of butter

Keep covered until serving


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the breaded fish with the sweet potato chips, vegetables and lemony mayo to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and enjoy!
