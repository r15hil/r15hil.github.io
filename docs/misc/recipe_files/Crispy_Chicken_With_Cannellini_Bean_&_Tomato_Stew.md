### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chopped shallot and garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Once softened add the potato cubes with a knob of butter and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the potato is beginning to brown

### Step 5

Add the drained cannellini beans to the pan with your cherry tomatoes

Add the chicken stock and spinach with a very generous crack of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, stirring occasionally for 16-17 min or until the potato is tender and the sauce has thickened – this is your cannellini bean & tomato stew

### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

Once browned, turn the chicken and cook for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Add half the chopped basil to the stew (save the rest for garnish!) and stir to combine

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and leave to rest for a min before carefully slicing

### Step 8

Serve the cannellini bean & tomato stew and top with the sliced crispy chicken

Sprinkle over the remaining chopped basil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
