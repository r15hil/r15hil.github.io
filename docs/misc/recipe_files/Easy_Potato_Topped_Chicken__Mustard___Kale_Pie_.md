## Description

This potato-topped chicken casserole is as easy as pie to prep. You'll combine diced chicken, soft cheese and shredded kale in an oven-proof dish and top the lot with grated potato and cheese. Pop it in the oven to bubble away until it's crisp, golden and very tempting! (Gluten-free, suitable for coeliacs).
