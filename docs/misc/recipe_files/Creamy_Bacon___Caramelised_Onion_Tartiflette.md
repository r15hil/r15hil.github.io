### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sprinkle them with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened

### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the streaky bacon into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp

Once crisp, transfer to kitchen paper, set aside and reserve the pan

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened and caramelised

Tip: Add a splash of oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

### Step 4

Chop the Rablochoix in half, then slice finely

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour, 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk and the double cream, bring to the boil and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the crispy bacon – this is your tartiflette sauce

### Step 5

Layer half the softened potatoes in an oven-proof dish

Dot half the sliced cheese over the potatoes (cover any gaps!), then pour over half the tartiflette sauce

Top with the remaining potatoes, pour over the remaining sauce and top with the remaining cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until bubbling and cooked through

### Step 6

While the tartiflette is cooking, slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely, add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in oven for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp

Chop the cornichons and parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped cornichons and parsley with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your cornichon salsa

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1604489347278-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Tear the little gem lettuce into bite-sized pieces, give them a wash and add to a serving bowl

Combine the white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Once the bread has crisped, divide the cornichon salsa between the ciabatta slices – these are your cornichon croutons

### Step 8

Serve the tartiflette with the cornichon croutons and salad to the side

Drizzle the dressing all over the salad

Let everyone dig in!
