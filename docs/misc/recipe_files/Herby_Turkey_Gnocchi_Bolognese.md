## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the turkey mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Add the gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the gnocchi


### Step 4

Add the Marmite to the pan with the dried oregano, dried basil, dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Add the finely chopped tomatoes with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until the turkey has cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency

Note: Please make sure you cook your turkey mince thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through the drained gnocchi – this is your herby turkey gnocchi bolognese


### Step 7

Tear the basil leaves over the herby turkey gnocchi bolognese

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Set the herby turkey gnocchi bolognese in the centre of the table, ready to share

Top with the grated Italian hard cheese and rocket and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
