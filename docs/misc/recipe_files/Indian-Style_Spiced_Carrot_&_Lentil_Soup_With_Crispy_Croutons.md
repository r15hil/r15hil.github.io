Top, tail and roughly chop your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 2

Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot with a pinch of salt, and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 3

Once the onion has started to soften, add your garam masala, ground turmeric, chopped ginger, red lentils and half the chopped chilli<span class="text-danger"> </span>(can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your<span class="text-danger"> </span>vegetable stock mix in 1.2L <span class="text-purple">[1.5L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2L]</span> boiled water

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized cubes

Place on a baking tray (or two!) and add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 5-6 min or until crispy – these are your crispy croutons

### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish later!)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut into wedges

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Once the lentils and carrots are tender, pulse with a (stick) blender (or food processor) until it has thickened, whilst keeping some of the vegetables chunky

Add the spinach and chopped coriander to the pot and cook for 2-3 min until wilted

Once wilted, add the juice of half your lime wedges – this is your Indian-style spiced carrot & lentil soup

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style spiced carrot & lentil soup in a bowl, and spoon your cultured coconut over the top

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserved coriander leaves, nigella seeds, crispy croutons and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
