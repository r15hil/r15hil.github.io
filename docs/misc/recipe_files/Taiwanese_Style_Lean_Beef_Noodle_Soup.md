## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 11g beef stock mix
- 2 fine egg noodle nests
- 2 tomatoes
- 250g British lean beef mince (<5% fat)
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
-  30ml soy sauce
- 1 star anise
- 25g honey
- 150g spring greens
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef mince with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until browned all over

Once browned, add the honey, half the soy sauce and half the five-spice (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until crispy (no pink meat!)


### Step 2

Transfer the cooked lean beef mince to a bowl and reserve the pan

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-7 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Wash the spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper  

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 4

Add the fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain and return to the bowl until serving


### Step 5

Reboil a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped tomatoes and garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min

Add the remaining five-spice, the star anise and a generous grind of pepper and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Dissolve the beef stock mix and the remaining soy sauce in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water – this is your beef stock


### Step 7

Once everything's fragrant, add the beef stock to the pan with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the sliced spring greens stir it all together and cook for 2 min further or until bright green and wilted

Once wilted, add the cooked lean beef mince and give everything a good mix up – this is your Taiwanese-style Beef broth

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Divide the drained noodles between 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> bowls and top with your Taiwanese-style beef broth

Tip: Watch out for the star anise and discard

Tear the basil leaves all over and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
