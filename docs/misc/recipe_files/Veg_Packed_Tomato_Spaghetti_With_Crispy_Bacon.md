## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrots


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crispy

Once crispy, transfer the bacon to kitchen paper and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the bacon is done, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and grated carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the diced pepper and chopped garlic with the dried oregano and cook for a further 3-4 min or until fragrant and softened


### Step 5

While the vegetables are cooking, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Once the veg has softened, add the tomato stock to the pan with the chopped tomatoes and a good grind of pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 8-10 min or until starting to thicken

Once thickened, add the drained spaghetti to the sauce with a splash of starchy water and cook for a final 1-2 min or until fully combined – this is your veg-packed tomato spaghetti


### Step 7

Add your red wine vinegar to a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of sugar and mix to combine

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

Break the crispy bacon into small pieces

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed tomato spaghetti

Sprinkle the crispy bacon pieces over the spaghetti and serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
