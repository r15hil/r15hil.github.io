- 1 rice vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 1 soy sauce sachet (15ml)

- 1 roasted garlic paste sachet (15g)
- 300g steamed white basmati rice

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, tear the chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for 5 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: Try not to stir the mushrooms too often, as this will stop them from caramelising!


### Step 3

While the mushrooms are cooking, cut the pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops

Cut the white base into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Combine the cornflour, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sriracha chilli sauce, rice vinegar and 80ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water

Whisk until smooth – this is your stir-fry sauce


### Step 5

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have softened, add the roasted garlic paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and pak choi to the pan and cook for 1 min further

Add the stir-fry sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 1 min or until the sauce is thickened – this is your hoisin pak choi & mushroom stir-fry


### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with half the sesame oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the ginger paste and steamed white basmati rice with a generous pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

Add the peanuts and remaining sesame oil to the rice, roughly tear in the coriander and stir it all together – this is your coriander rice

### Step 8

Serve the hoisin pak choi & mushroom stir-fry with the coriander rice to the side

Enjoy!
