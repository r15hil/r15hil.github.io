### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray and sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano, drizzle over a little olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give the chicken a good mix up until coated in the herbs

### Step 2

Put the tray (or two!) in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

### Step 4

Whilst the onion is cooking, add the conchiglie to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the conchiglie, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Once the garlic is fragrant, wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan with the ground paprika and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted

Cut the sun-dried tomatoes in half

### Step 7

Add the drained conchiglie to the pan with the chicken stock mix, soft cheese, half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), sliced chicken and the halved sun-dried tomatoes

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato free range chicken pasta

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato free range chicken pasta and sprinkle with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
