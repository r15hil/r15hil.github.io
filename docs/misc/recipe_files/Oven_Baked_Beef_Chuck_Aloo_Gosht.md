### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced beef and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

### Step 4

Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped onion and chopped tomatoes to the dish with the chopped potatoes and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your curry powder with your garam masala and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up

### Step 5

Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml] </span>boiled water with your tomato paste, ginger & garlic paste and your beef stock mix

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 55 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through – this is your beef chuck aloo gosht

Once the aloo gosht has had 30 min, reboil the kettle

Add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with a generous pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Dollop your natural yoghurt over the beef chuck aloo gosht and drizzle on your mango chutney

Scatter over the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the baked rice to the side

Dig in!
