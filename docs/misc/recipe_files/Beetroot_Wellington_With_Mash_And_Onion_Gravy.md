### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Chop your chestnut mushrooms very finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

### Step 2

Meanwhile, halve your Chantenay carrots (no need to peel!) and set them aside for later

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

### Step 3

Once done, add the cooked mushrooms (reserve the pan!) to a bowl with the chopped spinach, panko breadcrumbs, soy sauce and dried sage and give everything a good mix up – this is your mushroom stuffing

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person

### Step 4

Fill the middle of the pastry square[s] with the mushroom stuffing

Drain and chop half your beetroot[s] in half, then cut the remaining beetroot into wedges

Add the halved beetroot to the pastry square[s] and carefully wrap the pastry over the beetroot and push the edges together to form a loose seal

Use a fork to press down on the seal to bind together and brush with a little olive oil – this is your beetroot wellington

### Step 5

Add the beetroot wellington[s] to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Cut the remaining beetroot into wedges and add to the other side of the tray[s] with the halved carrots

Drizzle them with a little olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the carrots are tender

### Step 6

While the wellington is cooking, reboil a full kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 7

Dissolve your onion marmalade, Marmite and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Return the mushroom pan to a medium heat with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter (or olive oil!)

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until a sandy paste remains

Gradually pour in the stock, stirring frequently, and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy

### Step 8

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth

Serve the beetroot wellington with the mash and roasted carrot & beetroot to the side

Pour over the onion gravy

Enjoy!
