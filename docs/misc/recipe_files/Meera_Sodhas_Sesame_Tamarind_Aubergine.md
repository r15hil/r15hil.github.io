## Description

"The people of Andhra Pradesh love their pungent, spicy and sour flavours, as well as cooking vegetables in rich pastes made of sesame seeds, poppy seeds or peanuts. This dish is typical of the region and uses tamarind for sourness and sesame seeds for rich creaminess. I’ve borrowed the cracked wheat from Andhra’s neighbouring state Hyderabad."
