## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot, then keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ground cinnamon, ground cumin and curry powder and cook for 30 secs

Add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min, then add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 2 min


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Add the chopped sweet potato and lamb mince to the pan and cook for 5 min or until the lamb has browned and the sweet potato is starting to colour

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, then add the stock to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 10 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender and the lamb mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (some some leaves for garnish!)


### Step 6

Once the sweet potato is tender, remove the lid from the pan and cook until the liquid has reduced by half


### Step 7

Once reduced, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your natural yoghurt and chopped coriander – this is your spiced lamb & sweet potato curry

Fluff the brown rice with a fork and season with a small pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8

Serve the spiced lamb & sweet potato curry over the brown rice and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
