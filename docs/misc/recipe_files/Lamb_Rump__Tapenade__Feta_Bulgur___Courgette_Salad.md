## Ingredients

- 1 courgette
- 100g Greek feta cheese
- 325g British lamb rump
- 30g pitted black olives
- 10g parsley
- 15g capers
- 1 garlic clove
- 30g sultanas
- 1/2 lemon
- 75g bulgur wheat

## Instructions


### Step 1

Make the tapenade


Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6.


Peel and roughly chop the garlic.


Add the black olives, capers, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt to a food processor and blitz until smooth – this is your tapenade.


### Step 2

Seal the lamb


Pat the lamb rump dry with kitchen paper and season all over with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat.


Once hot, add the lamb and cook for 4-5 minutes or until golden all over.


### Step 3

Cook the bulgur wheat


While the lamb is cooking, add the bulgur wheat and sultanas to a pot with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat.


Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15-18 minutes or until all the water is absorbed and the bulgur is tender with a slight bite.


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving.


### Step 4

Roast the lamb


Transfer the sealed lamb to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the lamb is pink and blushing.


Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a plate and set aside to rest in a warm place for 5 minutes.


### Step 5

Prep the ingredients


Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks.


Crumble the feta.


Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half.


### Step 6

Make the courgette salad


Peel the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of courgette 'ribbons'.


Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt. 


Add the courgette ribbons and stir it all together – this is your courgette salad.


### Step 7

Finish the bulgur and slice the lamb


Once the bulgur is cooked, stir through the crumbled feta and chopped parsley and give everything a good mix up – this is your feta bulgur.


Slice the rested lamb finely.

### Step 8

Serve up!


Serve the sliced lamb with the feta bulgur and courgette salad to the side.


Spoon the tapenade over everything. 


Enjoy!
