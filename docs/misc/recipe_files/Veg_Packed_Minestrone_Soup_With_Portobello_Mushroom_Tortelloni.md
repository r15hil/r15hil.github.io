## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a medium sized pot (with a matching lid) over a medium heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the leek is beginning to soften


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 4

Once softened, add the drained cannellini beans, grated carrot, sliced garlic and your dried oregano to the pot with the leek and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Combine your vegetable stock mix and chopped tomatoes with 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pot and bring to a boil over a high heat

Grate your Italian hard cheese


### Step 7

Once boiling, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to the pot and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the tortellini is cooked with a slight bite – this is your veg-packed minestrone soup with portobello mushroom tortelloni

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed minestrone soup with portobello mushroom tortelloni in a bowl topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Tear over your basil and garnish with a little olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
