### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add 80ml<span class="text-danger"> [160ml]</span> milk to a bowl with half the cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add the chicken thighs to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later

Tip: This will help to tenderise your chicken!

### Step 3

Slice the cucumber finely into discs

Add the cucumber discs and the remaining cider vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – these are your quick-pickled cucumbers

### Step 4

Heat a small pot with 10g <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add the sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together until fully combined with a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce

### Step 5

Slice the gluten free brioche buns in half

Peel and grate the garlic

Add the mayo to a small bowl with the dried oregano, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style dip

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1679316394787-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Discard all the excess marinade from the chicken

Add the ground smoked paprika, cornflour and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>gluten<span class="text-danger"> </span>free<span class="text-danger"> </span>flour to the bowl with the marinated chicken

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1679316403773-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 7-8 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread a little of the ranch-style dip on the base of the warmed brioche halves, top with a handful of the quick-pickled cucumber and the fried chicken, then drizzle the buffalo sauce over the top

Top with the warmed brioche bun lids and serve the fries with the remaining quick-pickled cucumber and ranch-style dip to the side

Enjoy!
