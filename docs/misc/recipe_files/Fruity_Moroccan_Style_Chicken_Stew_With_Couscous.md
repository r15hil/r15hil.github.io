## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the pan with your ras el hanout and cook for 4 min


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[400ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl and pour over the vegetable stock

Cover with a tea towel and set aside to soften until serving


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add your roasted garlic paste to the pan with your finely chopped tomatoes, diced apricots, sultanas, chopped tomato and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil and cook for a further 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fruity Moroccan-style chicken stew


### Step 7

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] – this is your lemony couscous

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the fruity Moroccan-style chicken stew with the lemony couscous to the side

Garnish with your flaked almonds and a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
