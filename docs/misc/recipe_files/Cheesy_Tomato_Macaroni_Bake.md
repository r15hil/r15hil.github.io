## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the macaroni, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>starchy pasta water

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!


### Step 3

While the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the shallot has softened


### Step 4

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and dried oregano to the pan with your tomato paste and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock mix to the pan with the reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 7-8 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your tomato pasta sauce


### Step 6

While the sauce is thickening, tear your mozzarella into bite-sized pieces and add to some kitchen paper

Press down on the torn mozzarella with another piece of kitchen paper to squeeze out as much liquid as you can

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the halved cherry tomatoes and a small drizzle of olive oil in a bowl with a grind of pepper


### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the drained macaroni to an oven-proof dish

Add the tomato pasta sauce and mix it all together

Top with the torn mozzarella, grated cheddar cheese and halved cherry tomatoes

Put the dish under the grill for 8-10 min or until all the cheese is melted and golden – this is your cheesy tomato macaroni bake

### Step 8

To serve, leave the cheesy tomato macaroni bake to stand for 5 min before digging in (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!
