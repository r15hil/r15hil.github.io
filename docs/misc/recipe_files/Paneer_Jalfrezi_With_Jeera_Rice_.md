### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

### Step 4

Heat a pot with a lid with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once melted, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1 min or until starting to sizzle

Once sizzling, add your basmati rice, stirring to coat the grains in the butter and oil

### Step 5

Once the grains are coated, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your jeera rice

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the cubed paneer, sliced pepper and tomato wedges to the pan

Cook for 5-6 min further or until the paneer is golden and the pepper is starting to soften, turning the paneer occasionally for even colouring

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1583501920067-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan looks a little dry

Add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your paneer jalfrezi

### Step 8

Serve the paneer jalfrezi over the jeera rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
