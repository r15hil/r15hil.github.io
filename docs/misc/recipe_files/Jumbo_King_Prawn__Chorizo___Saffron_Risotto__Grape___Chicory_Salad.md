## Ingredients

- 100g seedless grapes
- 1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 160g arborio rice
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 100g chicory
- 100g British diced chorizo
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 248g jumbo king prawns
- 5g parsley
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 pinch of saffron
- 2 brown onions
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Start cooking the chorizo


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat.


Once hot, add the diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 minutes or until starting to crisp.


Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the brown <span class="text-highlight">onions</span>.


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic. Boil a kettle.


### Step 2

Prepare your saffron stock 


Once the chorizo is starting to crisp, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 5-6 minutes further or until the onion has softened.


Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 800ml <span class="text-danger">[1.6L]</span> boiled water, add the saffron and set aside to infuse – this is your saffron stock.


### Step 3

Begin the risotto 


Once the onion has softened, add the <span class="text-highlight">Chinese rice </span><span class="text-highlight">wine</span> <span class="text-highlight">and</span> arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat the grains in the oil.


### Step 4

Continue to cook your saffron risotto


Add 1/3 of the saffron stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed.


Continue to add the stock a little at a time, stirring continuously for 30-35 minutes or until the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked.


Tip: add a splash more boiled water if it's looking a little dry or the rice isn't quite cooked!


### Step 5

Prepare the grape &amp; chicory salad


Meanwhile, chop the grapes in half.


Separate the chicory leaves until you're just left with the core. Cut the core into quarters.


Combine the balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and sugar and mix well until combined – this is your balsamic dressing.


### Step 6

Finish your saffron risotto


Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks.


Chop the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half.


Once the rice is cooked, add a large knob of butter, most of the chopped parsley and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon – this is your chorizo &amp; saffron risotto.


### Step 7

Cook the jumbo king prawns


Heat a separate frying pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter and drizzle of olive oil over a high heat.


Pat the jumbo king prawns dry with kitchen roll.


Once hot, add the jumbo king prawns with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes, turning frequently, or until cooked through.

### Step 8

Serve <span class="text-highlight">up!</span>


Combine the chicory, grapes and balsamic dressing and give everything a good mix up.


Serve the jumbo king prawns over the chorizo &amp; saffron risotto and spoon over any juices from the prawn pan.


Sprinkle over the remaining parsley and garnish with a lemon wedge.


Enjoy!
