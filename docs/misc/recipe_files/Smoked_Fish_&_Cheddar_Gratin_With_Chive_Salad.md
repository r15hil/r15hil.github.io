Chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into small, bite-sized pieces

Once the béchamel sauce has thickened, add the grated cheddar, chopped basa, half your wholegrain mustard and a pinch of salt and pepper

Transfer the gratin mix to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with your panko breadcrumbs

Put the dish under the grill for 2-3 min or until golden – this is your smoked fish & cheddar gratin

### Step 8

Serve the smoked fish & cheddar gratin with the chive salad to the side
