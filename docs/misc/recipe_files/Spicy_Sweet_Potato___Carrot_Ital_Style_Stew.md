## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and a pinch of brown sugar and cook for 4-5 min until softened


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, peel and chop your sweet potato[es] and potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Add the carrot discs and chopped potatoes (the sweet potato will be added later) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min until slightly softened

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Once the carrot and potatoes have slightly softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground allspice and your bay leaf[ves]

Add half of the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1 min until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped sweet potato to the pan with the coconut stock and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender and the sauce has thickened slightly


### Step 6

Once the sweet potato is tender, wash your spinach

Add the spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for a final 2 min or until the spinach is wilted – this is your spicy sweet potato & carrot Ital-style stew


### Step 7

While the spinach is wilting, add your roti[s] to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, spread the hot roti with butter alternative once it's out of the microwave

### Step 8

Serve the spicy sweet potato & carrot Ital-style stew in a bowl with the warmed roti to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
