## Ingredients

- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Red pepper
- Tomato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomatoes into quarters


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large pot (with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the the diced onion and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, add the chopped pepper and tomato quarters to a baking tray (or two!)

Add half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the vegetables have softened and are beginning to char – this is your roasted pepper & tomato


### Step 4

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Once the onion has softened, add the remaining ground smoked paprika and ground coriander to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped potatoes and vegetable stock mix to the pot with 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender – this is your smoky soup base


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and mayo with a pinch of pepper and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your garlic aioli

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are fork tender, add the roasted pepper & tomato to the smoky soup base with a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your plant-based smoky pepper & tomato soup

Place the halved ciabatta[s] in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based smoky pepper & tomato soup and top with a dollop of the garlic aioli

Spread the toasted ciabatta with a knob of butter and serve to the side

Enjoy!
