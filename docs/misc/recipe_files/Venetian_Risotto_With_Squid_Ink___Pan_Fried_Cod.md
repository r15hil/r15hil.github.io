## Description

Risòto col néro is a signature dish of Venetian cuisine. The dramatic colouring reflects the culture of the city and its relationship with the sea. The squid ink gives it a deliciously subtle flavour, perfectly paired with delicate flaky cod and zingy lemon. (Gluten-free, suitable for coeliacs.)

## Ingredients

- 20g wild rocket
- 4g squid ink
- 1 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 2 x 110g cod fillets
- 2 garlic cloves
- 160g arborio rice
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Peel and dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic


Dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced garlic and arborio rice and cook for 1-2 min or until coated in the oil and lightly toasted (this is known in Italian as tostatura!)


### Step 4

Once the rice has toasted, add the vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, then add the squid ink stirring continuously for 20-25 min or until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked with a slight bite (this is known as al denté!)


Tip: Add a splash more water and keep cooking if the rice needs more time!


### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


### Step 6

Once the rice has been cooking for 15-20 mins, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the cod fillets to the pan and cook for 4 min, carefully flipping once halfway through, then season with a pinch of salt


Tip: Your fish is cooked once it flakes easily!


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through a generous knob of butter and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon – this is your risotto with squid ink


Wash and drain the wild rocket

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


Serve the pan-fried cod over the risotto with squid ink and garnish with the washed rocket and a lemon wedge


Drizzle the rocket with a little olive oil


Buon appetito!
