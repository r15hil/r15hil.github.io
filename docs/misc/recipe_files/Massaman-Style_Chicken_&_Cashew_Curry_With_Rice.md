### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Crush your cashew nuts with a rolling pin, add them to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!)

Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife

### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until the chicken is starting to brown

### Step 4

Whilst the chicken is browning, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, fish sauce and a pinch of sugar in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[290ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Once starting to brown, add your ground coriander, crushed cardamom pod[s] and red Thai curry paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the chicken is coated in the spices

### Step 6

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 7

Add the coconut stock, chopped sweet potato and lime leaf[ves] to the pan and cook, covered, for 8-10 min until the sweet potato is almost fork-tender

Once fork-tender, add the halved green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 3-4 min further or until the beans are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your massaman-style chicken curry

### Step 8

Discard the cardamom pod[s] and lime leaf[ves] from the curry

Serve the massaman-style chicken curry with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the toasted cashews

Enjoy!
