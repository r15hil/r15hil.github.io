## Instructions


### Step 1

Lay the cucumber flat on your chopping board and use a rolling pin to bash it so that it splits and breaks up


Tip: Wear an apron and lay a tea towel over the cucumber as the juices splatter!


Cut the broken cucumber into rough, bite-size pieces


### Step 2

Boil a kettle (used in step 3)


Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic very finely


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) it very finely


Mix the cucumber, garlic, ginger, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of sugar and 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> (3 tsp)</span> salt in sieve over a bowl


### Step 3

Meanwhile, break the noodles in half and add them to a pot of boiled salted water on a high heat


When boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 6-8 min or until cooked through with a slight bite, loosening with a fork


Once cooked, drain them under cold water and set aside


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut the pepper<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into 1cm strips, scraping out the pith and seeds with a teaspoon and discarding


Cut each mushroom into wedges


### Step 5

Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the pepper and mushroom


Cook on a high heat for 8-10 min until they've started to char


Tip: This makes them smoky

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks
