### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish with half of the juices, discard the remaining juices

Cover the dish with tin foil and put it in the oven for an initial 20 min

### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your mooli slaw mix and rice vinegar to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled mooli slaw

### Step 4

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine the grated garlic with your five-spice mix, hoisin sauce, honey and soy sauce in a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and stir everything together – this is your char siu-style sauce

### Step 5

Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Pick your coriander leaves from the stalks, discard the stalks

### Step 6

After an initial 20 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork joint from the oven and discard the tin foil

Spoon the char siu-style sauce all over the joint and return it to the oven for 10-12 min further, basting it twice more until the sauce is thick and the pork is nicely glazed – this is your char siu-style pork

### Step 7

Once cooked, carefully slice the char siu pork into 3 strips per person

Pierce the bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the sliced char siu pork and top with some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo and garnish with half of your crispy onions and coriander leaves (save the rest for later!) – these are your char siu-style pork bao buns

### Step 8

Serve the char siu-style pork bao buns with the fries and remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw to the side

Load up the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo, crispy onions and coriander leaves

Enjoy!
