### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large, bite-sized pieces, then add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, remove from the oven and leave to cool for a few min

### Step 2

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 3

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 4

Slice your flat white mushrooms finely

Chop your chestnut mushrooms in half

### Step 5

Once the pepper has cooled slightly, transfer it to a food processor with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add the juice of half your lime[s] with your pumpkin seeds and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until you have a chunky sauce – this is your red pepper salsa

### Step 6

Once the onions have softened, add the sliced flat white mushrooms and halved chestnut mushrooms to the pan with your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), soy sauce and smoked paprika

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the mushrooms have started to soften – these are your chipotle mushrooms

### Step 7

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Once the rice is cooked, add the chopped coriander with a generous pinch of salt and the juice of the remaining lime and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy coriander rice

Add your tortillas to a plate and microwave for 30 secs or until warmed through

### Step 8

Assemble the warmed tortillas with some zingy coriander rice and the chipotle mushrooms

Top with the pepper salsa and soured cream

Enjoy!
