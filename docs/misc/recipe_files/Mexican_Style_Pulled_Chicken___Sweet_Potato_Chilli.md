### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and cut the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Combine the tomato paste and soy sauce with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water — this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse the black beans

### Step 4

Once the chicken has browned, add the diced shallot, ground cumin, ground allspice, half of the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1647001189354-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add the chopped sweet potato, chopped pepper, tomato stock and drained black beans to the pan and cook, covered, for an initial 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

After an initial 15-20 min, remove the lid and cook for a further 3-4 min, or until the sauce has started to thicken

### Step 6

Whilst the chilli is cooking, add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the natural yoghurt and remaining smoked paprika in a small bowl — this is your spiced yoghurt

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Stir through 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the spiced yoghurt — this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken & sweet potato chilli

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style pulled chicken & sweet potato chilli with the basmati rice and spiced yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!
