## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Heat a hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your pork loin steak[s] with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until beginning to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin


### Step 4

Combine your BBQ sauce and tomato paste in a small bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar – this is your BBQ glaze

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a large bowl with your mayo, cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and mix it all together – this is your slaw


### Step 5

Once browned, remove the pork from the dish and set aside on a clean plate

Add the chopped potatoes to the dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and crushed garlic

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and place the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min – these are your smoky potatoes


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and top with the browned pork steak

Add any remaining juices from the pork to the BBQ glaze

Brush the pork with the BBQ glaze and return the dish to the oven and cook for 13-15 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one pot BBQ pork with smoky potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the one pot BBQ pork with smoky potatoes and the slaw to the side

Dig in!
