### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, half your dried oregano (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby roast potatoes


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the egg[s] from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled egg[s], then fill a bowl of ice-cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl, set aside and reserve the pot with the water

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut in half


### Step 4

Drain your tuna

Wash your lettuce, remove the outer leaves and tear into rough pieces, then shred the inner core


### Step 5

Combine your mayo and red wine vinegar in a bowl with the remaining dried oregano, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your creamy dressing


### Step 6

Add the halved green beans to the reserved pot of water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender, then drain and set aside


### Step 7

Combine the drained tuna, lettuce leaves and shredded lettuce in a large bowl with the cooked green beans and creamy dressing

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tuna salad

### Step 8

Serve the herby roast potatoes in bowls and top with the tuna salad and a boiled egg half – this is your tuna nicoise salad

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
