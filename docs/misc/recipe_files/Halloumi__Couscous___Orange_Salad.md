### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Slice your halloumi into thin strips

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s], then add to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled carrot

### Step 3

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side until golden and crisp

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your couscous, sultanas, half of your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside to soften

### Step 5

Add the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), your honey, the juice of half your orange[s] and a generous drizzle of olive oil to a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your orange harissa dressing

### Step 6

Peel the remaining<span class="text-danger"> </span>orange and slice into segments

Chop your dill roughly, including the stalks

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1584988271238-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork – this is your harissa couscous

Add the salad, harissa couscous, quick-pickled carrot and half of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your couscous salad

### Step 8

Serve the couscous salad with the golden halloumi slices over the top

Drizzle over the orange harissa dressing and top with the orange segments and remaining chopped dill – this is your halloumi, couscous & orange salad

Enjoy!
