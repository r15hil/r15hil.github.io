Boil a kettle

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan along with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until the peppers are lightly charred

### Step 3

While the peppers are cooking, add your gluten free spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Drain your king prawns

Once the peppers are charred, add the drained king prawns along with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min

### Step 6

Add the sliced garlic, chopped tomato and a small splash of water and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes are starting to soften and the prawns are cooked through

### Step 7

Once the tomatoes are soft, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) crème fraîche, most of the chopped coriander, half your ground sumac (you'll use the rest later!) and a splash of starchy pasta water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy harissa, charred pepper & king prawn gluten free spaghetti

Tip: If it's looking a little dry add a splash more of the starchy pasta water

### Step 8

Serve the creamy harissa, charred pepper & king prawn gluten free spaghetti

Top with the remaining ground sumac, remaining chopped coriander and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
