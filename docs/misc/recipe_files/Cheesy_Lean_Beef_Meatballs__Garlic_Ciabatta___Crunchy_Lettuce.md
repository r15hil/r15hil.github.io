## Ingredients

- Gem lettuce
- British lean beef mince (<5% fat) (125g) x0
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Ciabatta x2
- British lean beef mince (<5% fat) (250g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove x3
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop half your brown onion[s]

Grate the remaining onion


### Step 2

Combine your lean beef mince, grated onion, panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape the lean beef meatball mixture into 7 into meatballs per person


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef meatballs and cook for 4 min, turning occasionally, or until they’re browned all over

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 70ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once the meatballs are browned, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min further


### Step 5

Add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock, half the balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Return the lean beef meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 6 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella and tear it into rough pieces


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the meatballs and sauce to an oven-proof dish (or individual dishes)

Top with the torn mozzarella and put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until melted and bubbling – these are your cheesy lean beef meatballs

Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing


### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half, then add to a baking tray and put in the oven for 1-2 min or until slightly toasted

Once slightly toasted, spread each slice with butter and top with the remaining garlic, then return to the oven for a further 3-4 min

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper, then tear into large bite-sized pieces

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy lean beef meatballs with the garlic ciabatta and torn lettuce to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the lettuce

Enjoy!
