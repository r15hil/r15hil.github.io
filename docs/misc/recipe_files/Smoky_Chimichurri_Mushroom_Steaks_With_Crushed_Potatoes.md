### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Peel and cut the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half, lengthways

Sprinkle the cut-sides of the shallot halves with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

### Step 3

Once hot, add the coated shallot halves (sugar-side down) to the pan with the flat white mushrooms and cook for 1 min

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!

Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[90ml]</span> cold water and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until almost all the water has evaporated

After 5-6 min, remove the lid and cook for 1 min further or until all the water has evaporated, the mushrooms are tender and the shallots are caramelised

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add the waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-5 min <span class="text-danger">[6-8 min]</span> or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 5

While the potatoes are cooking, finely chop the parsley, including the stems

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped parsley and garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) to a bowl with the dried oregano, red wine vinegar, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky chimichurri

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1633508543243-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once done, transfer the cooked mushrooms to a bowl and set the caramelised shallot halves aside for serving (reserve the pan!)

Add half the smoky chimichurri to the bowl with the mushrooms and give everything a good mix up – these are your smoky chimichurri mushroom steaks

Mix the remaining smoky chimichurri with the mayo – this is your smoky chimichurri mayo

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1633508566416-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add the pumpkin seeds and spinach, then cook for 1 min or until the spinach has wilted – this is your pumpkin seed spinach

Roughly crush the fork-tender potatoes with a fork and season with salt and pepper

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!

### Step 8

Serve the smoky chimichurri mushroom steaks with the crushed potatoes, pumpkin seed spinach, caramelised shallot halves and smoky chimichurri mayo to the side

Enjoy!
