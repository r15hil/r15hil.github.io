## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 160g fine green beans
- 32g tomato paste
- 2 tsp ground paprika
- 130g white long grain rice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 26g smooth peanut butter
- 8ml soy sauce
- 1 lime
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced brown onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened


### Step 2

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Add the peanut butter to a small bowl with the ginger & garlic paste, soy sauce, ground cumin and the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>lime wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and mix until fully combined

Gradually whisk in 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> boiled water, a little at a time, until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your peanut sauce


### Step 3

Once the onion is slightly softened, reduce the heat to low

Add the tomato paste, ground paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the long grain white rice with 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and the vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your tomato spiced rice


### Step 5

Whilst the rice is cooking, cut a large piece of tin foil approx. the size of A3 sheet of paper

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!

Add the basa fillets to the middle of the foil

Pour the peanut sauce evenly over the basa fillets


### Step 6

Scrunch the edges of the foil together around the fish to form a sealed parcel,

Add the parcel to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your West African-style peanut basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is in the oven, trim the green beans and chop in half, then add the chopped beans to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Scrunch the foil around the beans to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (Cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the beans are tender

### Step 8

Serve the West African-style peanut basa with the spiced tomato rice and cooked green beans to the side

Spoon the remaining peanut sauce from the parcel over the basa and sprinkle with the crispy fried onions

Garnish with the remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!
