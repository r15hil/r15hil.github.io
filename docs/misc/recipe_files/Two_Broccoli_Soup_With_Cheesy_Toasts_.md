## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Take some butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften


### Step 2

Heat a large pot (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Cut your broccoli (save the Tenderstem for later!) into small florets and chop the stem[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces

Peel and roughly chop your potato[es]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[1.2L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.5L] </span>boiled water


### Step 4

Once the onion and garlic have softened, add the chopped potato, broccoli stems, florets and vegetable stock to the pot

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until everything is tender and cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your Tenderstem broccoli to one side of a tray, then drizzle with olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use two trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 5 min

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Cut your ciabatta[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into 4 slices per person

Remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the sliced ciabatta to the other side, then spread the sliced ciabatta with the softened butter and top with the grated cheese

Return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven for a further 10-12 min or until everything is cooked through and the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy toasts and roasted Tenderstem broccoli


### Step 7

Once cooked, blitz the soup with a (stick) blender until smooth

Stir through your natural yoghurt and season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your broccoli soup

Chop your chives finely

### Step 8

Serve the broccoli soup in a bowl topped with the roasted Tenderstem broccoli – this is your two broccoli soup

Serve with the cheesy toasts to the side for dunking and garnish with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped chives and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
