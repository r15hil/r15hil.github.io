## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into thin wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground coriander (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Peel and cut your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half

Chop half your onion[s] into wedges

Dice the remaining onion finely


### Step 4

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes, diced onion, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice from half your lime[s] to a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salsa


### Step 5

Once the potato wedges have had 15 min, add the onion wedges to the tray and return to the oven for 10-15 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy

Drain your king prawns


### Step 6

Add the drained prawns to a bowl with the remaining ground coriander, season them with a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through


### Step 7

Add your smashed avocado to a bowl with the remaining chopped coriander, the juice of the remaining lime[s] and a little drizzle of olive oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your guac

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried king prawns over the guac with the roasted potato & onion wedges to the side

Dollop the zingy salsa over the wedges – these are your salsa wedges

Enjoy!
