Nothing says sharing food like these quesadillas. You’ll sandwich crispy tortillas with smoky chorizo, sweet potato and cheese, then balance the richness with a zingy lime and tomato salsa to serve.

## Ingredients

- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Red onion
- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g) x2
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Coriander (5g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Lime
- Tomato x2
- Sweet potato

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your sweet potato[es] into discs

Add the sweet potato discs to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] into the oven for 12-15 min or until softened


### Step 2

While the sweet potato is cooking, peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add most of the chopped onion (save the rest for later!) and diced chorizo with a crack of black pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until the onion has softened


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and ground cumin to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Once the sweet potato discs have softened, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add them to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your chorizo & sweet potato mix

Reserve the tray[s] for later


### Step 5

Divide the chorizo & sweet potato mix between your tortillas, covering only half 

Top evenly with the grated cheese and fold each tortilla over so you're left with 3 half moon-shaped sandwiches per person – these are your chorizo & sweet potato quesadillas


### Step 6

Add the chorizo & sweet potato quesadillas to the reserved tray[s], drizzling each with a little vegetable oil

Place a second baking tray on top of each tortilla baking tray to weigh it down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 10 min, or until the tortillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted


### Step 7

While the chorizo & sweet potato quesadillas are cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped tomato and chopped coriander to a bowl with the reserved chopped onion, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Add the juice of your lime[s] and stir it all together – this is your salsa

### Step 8

Once done, allow the chorizo & sweet potato quesadillas to cool slightly, then slice them into triangles

Serve the chorizo & sweet potato quesadilla triangles with the salsa to the side

Enjoy!
