## Ingredients

-  'Nduja (40g)
- Fennel seeds (1tsp)
- Aubergine
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Gnocchi (350g)
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Rocket (20g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and cut into quarters, lengthways, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until golden and tender


### Step 2

While the aubergine is roasting, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind to a fine powder

Tip: Don't have a pestle and mortar? Chop them up as finely as you can

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until it begins to release some oil

Add the chopped tomatoes and crushed fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften


### Step 4

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes are starting to soften, add the roasted aubergine and tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your spicy aubergine sauce

Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your gnocchi


### Step 6

Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Tear over the remaining 'Nduja (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), top with your grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your spicy 'Nduja & aubergine gnocchi bake


### Step 7

While the gnocchi is baking, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the balsamic dressing and gently mix together

### Step 8

Serve spicy ‘Nduja & aubergine gnocchi bake with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
