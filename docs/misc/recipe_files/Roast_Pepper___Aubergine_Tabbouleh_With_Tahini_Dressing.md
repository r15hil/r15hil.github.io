## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>then slice in half lengthways


### Step 2

Slice each aubergine half lengthways into 4 wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips


### Step 3

Add the aubergine wedges and pepper strips to a baking tray

Drizzle with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-30 min or until the aubergine is tender and the pepper has softened


### Step 4

While the aubergine and pepper are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your tahini, agave, soy sauce and 1 tbsp [<span class="text-purple">1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil into a smooth paste

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and stir it all together until a smooth and glossy dressing forms

Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside until serving – this is your tahini dressing


### Step 6

Add your cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds to a separate baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until the cashews have darkened slightly in colour, then remove and allow them to cool slightly

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Chop your parsley and mint finely, discarding the stalks


### Step 7

Chop the cooled cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds coarsely

Fluff the cooked bulgur wheat with a fork and add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Stir through the chopped cashew nuts, pumpkin seeds and herbs – this is your tabbouleh

### Step 8

Serve the roasted pepper and aubergine over the tabbouleh with the tahini dressing drizzled over

Enjoy!
