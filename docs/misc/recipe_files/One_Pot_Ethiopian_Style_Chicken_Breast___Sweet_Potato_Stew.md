## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dishes and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover with tin foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air before cooking

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot add the sliced onions, chicken breast portion[s] and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min until the chicken is lightly golden and the onion is starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small bite size chunks

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Add your baharat, garam masala and ginger & garlic paste to the dish and cook for 1 min

Add your tomato paste and chopped tomatoes with the chopped sweet potato and chicken stock

Season with a pinch of salt and of pepper and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Nestle the potatoes into the stock as much as you can!


### Step 6

Bring to boil over a high heat then cover the dish with a lid

Put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked potatoes!

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once your stew is ready, remove the dish from the oven and stir the spinach through, put the lid back on and let stand for 2-3 min until it has wilted – this is your Ethiopian-style chicken & sweet potato stew

### Step 8

Serve the Ethiopian-style chicken & sweet potato stew
