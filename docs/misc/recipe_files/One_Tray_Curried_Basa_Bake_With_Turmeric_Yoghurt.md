### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min

### Step 2

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle 2/3 of your curry powder (save the rest for later!) over the basa and rub it into both sides until evenly coated

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – this is your curried basa

Place the curried basa on top of the vegetables

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through, the potatoes are crisp and the vegetables have softened – this is your one tray curried basa bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily
