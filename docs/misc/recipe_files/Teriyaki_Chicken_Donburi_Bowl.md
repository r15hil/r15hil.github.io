## Ingredients

- 150g sushi rice
- 1 toasted sesame seed sachet (5g)
- 20g pea shoots
- 1 carrot
- 1 Chinese rice wine sachet (15ml)
- 1 soy sauce sachet (30ml)
- 3g cornflour
- 1 black sesame seed sachet (5g)
- 2 mirin sachets (30ml)
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Once the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time for fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the cornflour to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and give it a good mix up

Add the soy sauce, mirin, Chinese rice wine and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar and stir it all together – this is your teriyaki sauce


### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the teriyaki sauce and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a maple syrup-like consistency


### Step 5

Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> thinner pieces


### Step 6

Add the chicken breast pieces to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and spoon over 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> of the thickened teriyaki sauce (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Slice the cooked chicken finely

### Step 8

Top the sticky rice with the sliced chicken, grated carrot and a handful of pea shoots

Spoon the remaining teriyaki sauce over the chicken and garnish with the sliced spring onion and sesame seeds

Enjoy!
