- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 32g tomato paste
- 130g white long grain rice
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 0 ground smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp ground allspice

- 1 sweet potato

- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g] </span>butter in a pot with a matching lid over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Cook for a further 2-3 min, stirring frequently, until the roux has browned – this is your brown roux


### Step 2

Add the sliced onion to the pot with brown roux

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 3-4 min, stirring occasionally, or until starting to soften

Boil a full kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your sweet potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skin on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, Henderson’s Relish, tomato paste and a generous pinch of salt in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Creole-style stock


### Step 4

Add half the chopped garlic to the pot with your ground smoked paprika and your ground allspice

Stir everything together and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant then add the Creole-style stock with the chopped sweet potato, dried thyme, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? go easy!), and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 15-18 min or until the sweet potato is tender and the stew has thickened


### Step 5

Heat a separate pot with a matching lid over a medium heat and add a knob of butter

Once melted, add the remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice to the pot with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your garlic rice


### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is tender, add your haddock bites to the stew and gently stir it all together

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any smaller ones into bite-sized pieces

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min, or until the haddock bites are cooked through – this is your Creole-style haddock & sweet potato stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Creole-style haddock & sweet potato stew in bowls with the garlic rice in the centre

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!
