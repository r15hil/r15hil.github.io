## Ingredients

- 100g diced chorizo
- 50g soft cheese
- 190g linguine
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 80g spinach
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 2

While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min


### Step 3

Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisp


### Step 4

While the chorizo is cooking, zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Slice the remaining non-zested lemon into wedges


### Step 5

Once the chorizo is cooked, add the Chinese rice wine, soft cheese and 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water to the pan and cook for 2 min


### Step 6

Wash the spinach, then add it to the pan along with the juice of the zested lemon (reserve the wedges for garnish)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach is wilted and you are left with a loose sauce

### Step 7

Add the drained linguine to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony chorizo & spinach linguine

### Step 8

Serve the lemony chorizo & spinach linguine in shallow bowls and top with the lemon zest and a generous grind of pepper

Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
