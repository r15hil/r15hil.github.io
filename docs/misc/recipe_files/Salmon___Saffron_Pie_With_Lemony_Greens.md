### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7.


Boil a kettle


Peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces


Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr vegetable stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water


Add the saffron and set aside to infuse – this is your saffron stock

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the salmon fillets with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned on both sides and almost cooked through


Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan (and oil)

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat (add a drizzle more oil if it's looking a little dry)


Once hot, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir for 1 min or until a sandy paste remains


Add the saffron stock with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk and cook for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains


Add the Chinese rice wine and clotted cream and cook for 1 min further – this is your saffron sauce

### Step 5

Chop the chives finely


Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a large knob of butter


Mash until smooth


Add the chopped chives with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your chive mash

### Step 6

Flake the salmon into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> individual oven-proof dishes (alternatively, you can just use one larger dish)


Pour the saffron sauce all over and top with the chive mash


Sprinkle the grated Italian hard cheese over the top and put the dishes in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and bubbling - these are your salmon &amp; saffron pies

### Step 7

Whilst the pies are in the oven, <span class="text-highlight">chop the green beans in half</span>


Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat


Once hot, add the <span class="text-highlight">chopped green beans</span> and mange tout with a pinch of salt and <span class="text-highlight">cook for 5-6 min</span> or softened


Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and cover to keep warm until serving - these are your lemony greens

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


Serve the salmon &amp; saffron pie with the lemony greens to the side


Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges


Enjoy!
