## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, chop your black olives finely

Dice your tomato[es] finely

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Combine the chopped olives, basil and tomato with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt in a bowl

Stir it all together – this is your olive & basil tapenade


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your tomato paste with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water, a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar and the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!) in a separate bowl – this is your garlicky tomato sauce


### Step 5

Once the chips have been cooking for 15 min, add your meat-free patty[ies] to a separate tray (use tin foil to avoid mess)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half, then reassemble


### Step 6

Once the patty[ies] has been cooking for 10-12 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and spoon the garlicky tomato sauce over the top

Top the patty[ies] with a cheese flavour slice and add the sliced brioche bun[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheeze has melted and the brioche is warmed through


### Step 7

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl of dressing and gently mix together

### Step 8

Fill the warmed brioche bun with some olive & basil tapenade and a cheezy meat-free burger patty – this is your Italian-style plant-based burger

Serve the chips, dressed salad and any remaining olive & basil tapenade to the side

Enjoy!
