## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 25g blanched almonds
- 120g spinach
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 30g tamarind paste
- 1 cauliflower
- 1 brown onion
- 100g red lentils

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Cut the cauliflower into small florets, discard the stem and leaves


### Step 2

Add the cauliflower florets to a baking tray with the ground paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-30 min or until the cauliflower is golden and crisp – this is your spiced cauliflower


### Step 3

Whilst the cauliflower is cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>and tamarind paste in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water – this is your tamarind stock

Reboil a kettle

Wash the spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over until it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the garam masala, ground fenugreek, ground turmeric and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Meanwhile, rinse the red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils, chopped spinach and tamarind stock, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are cooked and the sauce has thickened – this is your spinach & tamarind dal


### Step 7

While the dal is cooking, add the blanched almonds to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 5 min or until they've darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, set them aside to cool before chopping roughly

### Step 8

Serve the spiced cauliflower over the spinach & tamarind dal

Sprinkle over the chopped toasted almonds

Enjoy!
