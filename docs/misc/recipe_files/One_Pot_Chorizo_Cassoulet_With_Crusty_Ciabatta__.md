## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 100g diced chorizo
- 32g tomato paste
- 2 ciabattas
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 1 white potato
- 1 carrot
- 400g canned cannellini beans
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's gets started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over high heat

Once hot add the diced chorizo and cook for 2-3 min until browned


### Step 3

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Top, tail, and slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into large discs

Crush the garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

Roughly chop the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add the tomato paste, chopped onion, crushed garlic, sliced carrot, bay leaves and chopped potato to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans


### Step 5

Add 350ml <span class="text-danger">[650ml]</span> boiled water to the casserole dish with the chicken stock mix, drained cannellini beans, red wine vinegar, smoked paprika, cherry tomatoes, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Nestle the potatoes into the stock as much as you can, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 45 min or until and the potatoes are tender – this is your chorizo cassoulet


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the chorizo cassoulet is almost done, trim, then add the green beans to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the ciabattas to the other side of the tray

Put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until the beans are tender but retaining a bite and the ciabattas are warm and crusty

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 8

To serve, remove the chorizo cassoulet dish from the oven, discard the dried bay leaves and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Serve the green beans and crusty ciabattas to the side

Tip: For extra indulgence, spread the ciabattas with a little butter before dipping

Let everyone dig in!
