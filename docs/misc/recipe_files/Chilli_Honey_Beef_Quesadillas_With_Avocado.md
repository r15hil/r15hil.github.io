## Ingredients

- 80g cheddar cheese
- 1 green chilli
- 1 avocado
- 250g British beef mince
- 1/2 white wine vinegar sachet (7.5ml)
- 1 honey pot (25g)
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once hot, add the beef mince and cook for 3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add half the chopped chilli (save the rest for later!) with the smoked paprika and cook for 2-3 min

Add the honey and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through and sticky – this is your chilli-honey beef


### Step 3

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Divide the chilli-honey beef between the tortilla wraps, covering only half of the wrap

Top evenly with the grated cheese and fold each tortilla over so you're left with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> half moon-shaped sandwiches – these are your chilli-honey beef quesadillas


### Step 5

Add the chilli-honey beef quesadillas to a baking tray (or two!)

Place a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 12 min, or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted


### Step 6

Whilst the quesadillas are in the oven, cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon and dice roughly

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 7

Combine the diced avocado with the remaining chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tangy avocado salsa

### Step 8

Chop the chilli-honey beef quesadillas in half

Serve the quesadillas with the tangy avocado salsa dolloped all over

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
