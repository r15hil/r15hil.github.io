## Ingredients

- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Ciabatta x2
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 8-10 min or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!), breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Once browned, add your tomato paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your Henderson's Relish, beef stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water

Bring to the boil and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce thickens to a gravy-like consistency – this is your sloppy joe filling


### Step 4

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half


### Step 5

Top the ciabatta bases with the sloppy joe filling and grated cheese and place a ciabatta lid on top – these are your filled ciabattas

Reserve the pan


### Step 6

Wipe the reserved pan clean (careful, it will be hot!) and return it to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the filled ciabattas and press them down very firmly with a spatula

Cook for 4-5 min on each side or until the bread is golden and the cheese has melted – this is your sloppy joe grilled cheese


### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressing

Toss the salad with the dressing – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Cut the sloppy joe grilled cheese in half and serve with the chips and dressed salad on the side

Drizzle your mayo over the chips

Enjoy!
