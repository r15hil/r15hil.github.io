Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips, onion and sliced chicken to the pan with the BBQ spice blend

Cook for 8-10 min or until the vegetables have softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky 'n' sweet BBQ chicken fajita filling

Stir it all together – this is your salsa
