- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Fresh orecchiette (250g)
- Cracked black pepper (2.5g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then cut them in half, lengthways

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a high heat

Once hot, add the halved sprouts and sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until golden

Once golden, add a splash of boiled water and cook, covered, for a further 1-2 min or until the sprouts are tender


### Step 4

Whilst the sprouts are cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 125ml <span class="text-purple">[165ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[215ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock


### Step 5

Add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Once the sprouts are tender, reduce the heat to medium, add your cracked black pepper and roasted garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy stock and cook for a further 1 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your Brussels sprouts cacio e pepe sauce


### Step 7

Add the cooked orecchiette to the sauce with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your Brussels sprouts cacio e pepe with fresh orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the Brussels sprouts cacio e pepe with fresh orecchiette and garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
