### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Add your couscous, diced apricots and ground turmeric to a heatproof bowl, season generously with salt and mix it all together

Add 130ml <span class="text-purple">[190ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[260ml]</span> boiled water to the bowl, then cover with a tea towel and set aside

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, increase the heat to high and add your diced chicken breast and cook for 6-7 min further until starting to brown

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the grated carrot to a large bowl with half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your carrot slaw

### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add your ras el hanout and a splash of cold water and cook for 4-5 min further until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken filling

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and put the plate in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until the tortillas are warmed through

### Step 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tahini, mayo, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), remaining white wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your tahini mayo

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1699976289877-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Fluff the fruity couscous with a fork

Top half of each warmed tortilla with the fruity couscous, spiced chicken filling, salad and carrot slaw

Dollop the tahini mayo over the top

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!

### Step 8

To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each loaded tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a burrito, then wrap them in tin foil to hold everything together – these are your Moroccan-style burritos

Serve the Moroccan-style burritos alongside the remaining salad and carrot slaw and enjoy!
