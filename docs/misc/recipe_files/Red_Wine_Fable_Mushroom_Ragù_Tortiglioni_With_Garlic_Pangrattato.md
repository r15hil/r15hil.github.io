### Step 3

While the veg is softening, add the tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Once browned, add the chopped garlic and dried thyme to the pan with the tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the red wine paste and vegetable stock mix with the chopped tomatoes and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 5-7 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the carrot is completely softened

### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the panko breadcrumbs and a small pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently, for 3-4 min further or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a small bowl and set aside – this is your garlic pangrattato

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained tortiglioni to the sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until the pasta is evenly coated in the sauce – this is your red wine Fable mushroom ragù tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the red wine Fable mushroom ragù tortiglioni in bowls and sprinkle the garlic pangrattato over the top

Enjoy!
