## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin


### Step 3

Add the chopped chilli, crushed garlic, your dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and ground paprika to a food processor

Add a squeeze of lemon juice with a pinch of salt and blitz until you have a coarse paste – this is your malagueta-style marinade


### Step 4

Combine your king prawns with the malagueta-style marinade in a bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)


### Step 5

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Drain your sweetcorn

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, remove them from the oven and add the drained sweetcorn

Mix everything together and return the tray to the oven for a final 12-15 min or until the sweetcorn has lightly charred and the potatoes are tender


### Step 6

Meanwhile, thread the marinated prawns onto the soaked skewers

Once the potatoes are almost done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the prawn skewers to the pan with any remaining malagueta-style marinade

Cook for 2-3 min on each side or until cooked through – these are your spicy malagueta-style king prawns


### Step 7

Combine your mayo, remaining lemon juice and carrot ribbons in a medium bowl

Add the cooked potatoes and charred sweetcorn to the bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together – this is your gaucho potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the gaucho potato salad with the spicy malagueta-style king prawns to the side

Tear your coriander over the top and drizzle over any remaining malagueta sauce

Enjoy!
