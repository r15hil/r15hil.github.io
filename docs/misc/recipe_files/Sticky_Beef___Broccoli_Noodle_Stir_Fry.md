- Five-spice mix (1tsp)
- Spring onion x2
- Broccoli
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Medium egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Garlic clove x2
- British beef mince (250g)

- Soy sauce (15ml) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel your garlic and ginger, then slice your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Chop all of these together as finely as you can

Tip: If you can't handle the heat, save some of the chilli for another recipe!

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, ginger & chilli and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your beef mince and your five-spice mix and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

While the mince is cooking, combine your cornflour with 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[125ml] </span>cold water in a bowl and give it a good whisk

Add your hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your sticky stir-fry sauce


### Step 5

Cut your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem and leaves


### Step 6

Add your medium egg noodles and broccoli florets to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil and cook over a high heat for 5-6 min or until the noodles are cooked and the broccoli is tender

Once done, drain the noodles & broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 7

Once the beef has started to brown, add the sticky stir-fry sauce to the pan with half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the beef is cooked, add the drained noodles & broccoli and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky beef & broccoli noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the sticky beef & broccoli noodle stir-fry in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
