## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Pat the pork belly dry with kitchen paper


Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below


Season with a very generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a very high heat


Once very hot, add the pork belly, fat side down and cook for 4 min or until coloured and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side&nbsp;


Once done, transfer the pork to a tin foil lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 40 min

### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and run under cold water until cooled


Once cooled, set aside for later

### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the chilli jam&nbsp;with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> soy sauce sachets (you'll use the rest later!)&nbsp;in a small bowl &ndash; this is your pork glaze


Bash the roasted peanuts with a rolling pin until they are finely crushed (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)


&nbsp;

### Step 5

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Combine the chopped ginger, rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar &ndash;&nbsp;this is your&nbsp;dressing

### Step 6

Rip the little gem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;and chop the cucumber into rough, bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely


Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Pick the coriander and mint leaves from the stalks and chop them roughly


Cut the red&nbsp;chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, de-seed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips


&nbsp;

### Step 7

Add all of the above to a large salad bowl with the cooled noodles


Once the pork has had&nbsp;40 min, remove the tray from the oven and spoon over the&nbsp;pork glaze


Sprinkle over the&nbsp;crushed peanuts and return the tray to the oven for 5-7 min (scrunch the foil edges up to stop the glaze escaping!)


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Once done, remove the pork from the oven, leave to rest for 5 min, then slice it finely


Dress the noodle salad with the dressing


Serve the sticky Asian pork over the noodle salad and drizzle with any remaining glaze&nbsp;and crushed nuts


Enjoy!&nbsp;
