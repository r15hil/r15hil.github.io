### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)

### Step 2

Add the sliced peppers and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the veg has softened and is cooked through

Once done, carefully cut off the onion root and remove the skins – this is your paprika veg

### Step 3

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with a matching lid, with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Trim then slice your spring onion[s]

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes and sliced spring onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your cherry tomato salsa

### Step 5

Cut your lime[s] in half

Zest half the lime[s]

Combine your natural yoghurt, lime zest and juice of half your lime[s] in a small bowl – this is your lime yoghurt

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 6

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water, then drain and rinse your black beans

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your tomato paste, drained black beans and your chipotle paste and stir for 1 min or until the beans are coated in the paste

### Step 7

Add the vegetable stock and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once the sauce has thickened, remove the beans from the heat

Gently crush a few of the beans with a masher and season with a generous grind of pepper – these are your refried beans

### Step 8

Serve the brown rice with the refried beans, cherry tomato salsa and paprika veg to the side

Top with a dollop of lime yoghurt and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
