## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel your garlic

Chop half of your tomato[es] roughly (save the rest for later!)

Slice half your green chilli[es] finely and set aside for later, then chop the remaining green chilli roughly


### Step 2

Add your peeled garlic and chopped tomato to a food processor with the roughly chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your ground cumin, tomato paste, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), half your coriander (you'll use the rest later), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your chilli paste


### Step 3

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to a bowl, drain away half the juices, then shred apart using two forks

Add half your chilli paste (save the rest for later!) to the shredded pork and give everything a good mix up – this is your enchilada filling

Divide the enchilada filling between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and arrange them into an oven-proof dish


### Step 4

Spoon over the remaining chilli paste

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 18-20 min or until bubbling and golden round the edges – these are your enchiladas


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the finely sliced chilli with the juice of half your lime[s] in a bowl with a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up – these are your quick-pickled chillies

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and cut into quarters, lengthways

Grate your cheddar cheese finely


### Step 6

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Chop the remaining tomato[es] finely

Chop the remaining coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the diced shallot and chopped tomato in a bowl with the chopped coriander, juice of the remaining lime[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your salsa fresca


### Step 7

After an initial 18-20 min, remove the dish from the oven and top the enchiladas with the grated cheese

Return the dish to the oven and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your pulled pork enchiladas

Drain the quick-pickled chillies, reserving the pickling liquid

Combine the reserved pickling liquid with the mayo in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your tangy mayo

### Step 8

Serve the pulled pork enchiladas and drizzle over the tangy mayo

Garnish with the quick-pickled chillies (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side and top with the salsa fresca

Enjoy!
