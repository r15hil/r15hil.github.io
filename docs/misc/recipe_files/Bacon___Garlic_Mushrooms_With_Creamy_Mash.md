## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chestnut mushrooms into quarters

Chop your smoked streaky bacon into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Line a baking tray (or two!) with a large piece of tin foil

Trim your Tenderstem broccoli, then add to the middle of the foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter

Scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel[s] and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crisp

Once done, transfer the crispy bacon to kitchen paper and set aside, reserving the pan


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for for 6-7 min or until starting to brown

Once browned, add the chopped garlic and cornflour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and crème fraîche to the pan with your chicken stock mix and 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water

Return most of the crispy bacon to the pan (save some for garnish!) and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened a little – these are your bacon & garlic mushrooms


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your creamy mash

### Step 8

Serve the bacon & garlic mushrooms over the creamy mash with the Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Garnish with the remaining crispy bacon

Enjoy!
