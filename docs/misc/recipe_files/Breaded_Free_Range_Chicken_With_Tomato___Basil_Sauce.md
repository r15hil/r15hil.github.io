## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Panko breadcrumbs (20g)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Basil (5g)
- British free range egg
- Garlic clove x2
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Rocket (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Cover your free range chicken breast portion[s] with cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until flattened slightly

Season the flattened chicken with a generous pinch of salt


### Step 4

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it into the beaten egg and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your breaded free range chicken

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to break down

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs, then add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> water with a pinch of pepper and sugar and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 7

Combine your Dijon mustard and white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your mustard dressing

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through the chopped basil and a knob of butter – this is your tomato & basil sauce

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the breaded free range chicken over the tomato & basil sauce with the crispy potatoes and salad to the side

Drizzle the mustard dressing over the salad

Enjoy!
