### Step 2

Add chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with the chopped garlic, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy garlic potatoes

### Step 4

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your cider vinegar with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 5

Once hot, add the sausage patty[ies] to the pan and cook for 5 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the patty[ies] is almost cooked through, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat, once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking (give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!)

### Step 6

Add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Carefully slice in half before serving

Add the salad to the bowl of dressing and toss until fully coated – this is your zingy salad

Season the fried egg[s] with a grind of black pepper

### Step 7

Divide your smashed avocado between the warmed ciabatta base and lid

Top the base with a handful of zingy salad, a sausage patty, a fried egg and the warmed ciabatta lid – this is your sausage, egg & avocado sandwich

### Step 8

Serve the sausage, egg & avocado sandwich with the crispy garlic potatoes and remaining zingy salad to the side

Enjoy!
