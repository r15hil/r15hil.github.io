### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Peel your carrot[s], and continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water and the miso glaze to the pan

Cook for a further 10-12 min, covered, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)
