## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Slice your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Add a pinch of salt and sugar to a bowl with a splash of boiled water and stir everything together until dissolved

Once dissolved, add your cider vinegar and sliced green chilli and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli


### Step 2

Wash and chop your lettuce roughly, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chop your coconut flakes finely


### Step 3

Drain your jumbo prawns, then pat them dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Add a handful of flour to a bowl

Crack your egg[s] into a separate bowl and beat with a fork

Combine your panko breadcrumbs and chopped coconut flakes in another bowl – these are your coconut breadcrumbs


### Step 5

Coat the jumbo prawns in the flour, tap off any excess, then add into the beaten egg and finally press into the coconut breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your breaded jumbo prawns


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the breaded jumbo prawns and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your crispy coconut jumbo prawns

Tip: Do the prawns in batches if you need to so you don't overcrowd the pan!


### Step 7

Whilst the prawns are cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Cut your lime[s] into wedges

### Step 8

To make your tacos, pile the warmed tortillas with your smashed avocado, the chopped lettuce, diced tomato and the crispy coconut jumbo prawns

Top with the quick-pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
