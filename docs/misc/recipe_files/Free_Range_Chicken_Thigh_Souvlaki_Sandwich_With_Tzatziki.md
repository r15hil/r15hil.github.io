## Ingredients

- Cumin seeds (1tsp)
- British free range skinless chicken thighs (320g)
- Cumin seeds (2tsp) x0
- Mint (5g) x0
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove
- Mint (10g)
- Skewers x2
- Tomato x2
- Shallot
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and soak your skewers in cold water (this stops them from burning whilst cooking!)

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, dried oregano and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced shallot to a large bowl with your free range chicken thighs, cumin seeds, ground smoked paprika, red wine vinegar, half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a drizzle of olive oil


### Step 3

Give everything a good mix up and season with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – these are your marinated free range chicken thighs

Thread the marinated free range chicken thighs onto the soaked skewers in a snake-like fashion – these are your marinated free range chicken thigh skewers


### Step 4

Transfer the marinated free range chicken thigh skewers to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 22-25 min or until the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your free range chicken thigh souvlaki skewers

Once cooked through, slide and slice half of the free range chicken thigh souvlaki off each skewer on a clean board


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice half of your cucumber into discs

Cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water


### Step 6

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems


### Step 7

Add the grated cucumber to a small bowl with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), most of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt – this is your tzatziki

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty, then carefully slice them in half before serving

### Step 8

To build your sandwich, fill the crusty ciabatta with the sliced free range chicken thigh souvlaki, a dollop of tzatziki, a couple of herby fries and a tomato round – this is your free range chicken thigh souvlaki sandwich

Serve the remaining herby fries to the side with the remaining free range chicken thigh souvlaki skewer, remaining tomato rounds, sliced cucumber and reserved chopped mint

Enjoy!
