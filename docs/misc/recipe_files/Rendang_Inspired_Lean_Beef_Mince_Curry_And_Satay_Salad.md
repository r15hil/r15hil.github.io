### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up into very small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

While the beef is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Wash, then cut your lettuce into wedges

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

### Step 4

Once the beef is beginning to brown, add your cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Only add a little!) with your ground turmeric and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped creamed coconut with your tamarind paste, ginger & garlic paste and half your peanut butter (you'll use the rest later!)

### Step 5

Add half your sriracha with your soy sauce, beef stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water

Cook for a further 4 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your rendang-inspired lean beef mince curry

### Step 6

While the curry is cooking, combine the remaining peanut butter with your white wine vinegar and remaining sriracha

Add a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar with a little olive oil and mix it all together – this is your satay dressing

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1705676286769-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the rendang-inspired lean beef mince curry over the cooked rice and garnish with the remaining sliced chillies (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side and drizzle over the satay dressing

Enjoy!
