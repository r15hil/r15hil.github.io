## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Gem lettuce
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x4
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp and browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine your onion marmalade, Dijon mustard and mayo in a small bowl with a pinch of pepper – this is your sweet onion mayo

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Slice your brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves, cut-side down, to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until nicely browned

Once browned, transfer them to a plate (save the pan for later!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? You might need to do this in batches!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, score your sausages by drawing the knife lengthwise along the sausage – but don't cut all the way through!

Open the cut side then press down with your hand to flatten them out to form sausage patties (clean hands is the best way!)

Peel the skins away from the back of the patties and discard


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage patties, cover with a lid and cook for 4 min on each side, until the patties have browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Press the patties down with a spatula to keep them nice and flat throughout cooking


### Step 6

Combine your red wine vinegar, dried oregano and chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) with a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your vinaigrette


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves into bite-sized pieces and add them to the bowl with the vinaigrette

Toss the lettuce leaves in the vinaigrette – this is your lettuce salad

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, top each brioche base with 2 sausage patties, a spoonful of sweet onion mayo and finish with the brioche lid

Serve the lettuce salad and wedges to the side

Enjoy!
