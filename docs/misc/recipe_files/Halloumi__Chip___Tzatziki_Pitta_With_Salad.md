### Step 2

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with the dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 3

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grate half the cucumber and slice the rest into batons

Add the chopped garlic, chopped mint and grated cucumber to a bowl with the natural yoghurt and mix it all together – this is your tzatziki

### Step 5

Slice the halloumi widthways into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> equal-sized strips

Then slice each strip in half so you are left with 8 <span class="text-danger">[16] </span>halloumi sticks

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halloumi sticks and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 7

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Fill the warmed pittas with the chips, golden halloumi sticks, cucumber batons and a handful of baby leaf salad

Top with the tzatziki and quick-pickled onions then wrap in the tin foil to hold it all together – these are your halloumi, chip & tzatziki pittas

### Step 8

Serve the halloumi, chip & tzatziki pittas with any remaining tzatziki and baby leaf salad to the side

Enjoy!
