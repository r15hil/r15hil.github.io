### Step 7

After the 5 min, add the pea shoots and most of the chopped mint (save some for garnish!)


Transfer everything to a food processor and blitz until smooth &ndash; this is your pea shoot &amp; leek soup


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Top&nbsp;the pea shoot &amp; leek soup&nbsp;with the croutons and crumbled feta
