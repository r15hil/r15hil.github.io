## Ingredients

- 150g baby leaf spinach
- 250ml single soya
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 21g wholegrain mustard
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 2 x 100g smoked basa fillets

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, reboil a kettle

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water

Add the single soya, wholegrain mustard and a generous grind of pepper and stir it all together – this is your creamy stock


### Step 3

Add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water over it until it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool


### Step 4

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the wilted spinach as much as you can and then chop it roughly

Chop the smoked basa fillets into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Add the chopped basa, chopped spinach and creamy stock to an oven-proof dish – this is your smoked basa mixture

Give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and crush them lightly with a fork

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!


### Step 7

Top the smoked basa mixture with the crushed potatoes, spread them out evenly

Put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until the potatoes are crispy and browned – this is your dairy-free smoked basa florentine bake

### Step 8

Leave the dairy-free smoked basa florentine bake to cool for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!
