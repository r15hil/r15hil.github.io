Give everything a good mix up

### Step 6

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and crush them lightly with a fork

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!

### Step 7

Top the smoked basa mixture with the crushed potatoes, spread them out evenly

Put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until the potatoes are crispy and browned – this is your dairy-free smoked basa florentine bake

### Step 8

Leave the dairy-free smoked basa florentine bake to cool for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!
