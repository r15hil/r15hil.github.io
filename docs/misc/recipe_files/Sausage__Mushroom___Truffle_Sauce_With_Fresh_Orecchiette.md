### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Once the sausage is browned, crumble in your chestnut mushrooms using your hands and cook for a further 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 5

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chopped garlic to the sausage and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your double cream and chicken stock mix and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce starts to thicken and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained orecchiette and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> reserved pasta water to the pan with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce â€“ this is your sausage & mushroom sauce with fresh orecchiette

### Step 8

Serve the sausage & mushroom sauce with fresh orecchiette and drizzle your truffle oil all over

Garnish with the salad, a little drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
