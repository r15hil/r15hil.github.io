## Ingredients

- Spring onion
- Fine egg noodle nests (2pcs)
- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Fine egg noodle nest x0
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Garlic clove
- British beef mince (250g)
- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Spinach (80g)
- Roasted peanuts (25g)
- Honey (25g)
- Canned sweetcorn (150g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] and drain your sweetcorn

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool and once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop roughly


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your roasted peanuts and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to toast

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 3

Once slightly toasted, add half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with a few generous grinds of pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until caramelised

Once caramelised, transfer the peanuts to a plate to cool into a brittle and reserve the pan – these are your honey pepper peanuts

Reboil a full kettle


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Cook for a further 4 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> starchy noodle water


### Step 6

Once the beef has browned, add 2/3 of the spring onion (save the rest for garnish!), the chopped garlic, drained sweetcorn and chopped spinach to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has softened

Once softened, add your cornflour, remaining honey and soy sauce with the reserved starchy noodle water and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Add the drained noodles and cook for a further 2-3 min or until everything's coated in sauce – this is your beef & sweetcorn stir-fry

Chop your honey pepper peanuts roughly

### Step 8

Serve the beef & sweetcorn stir-fry

Top with the remaining spring onion and chopped honey pepper peanuts

Enjoy!
