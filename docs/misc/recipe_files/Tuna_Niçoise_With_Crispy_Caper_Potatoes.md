## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 80g trimmed fine green beans
- 1 can of tuna (160g)
- 1 Dijon mustard pot (5.5g)
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 white wine vinegar sachets (30ml)
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 red gem lettuce
- 1 bag of pitted black olives (30g)
- 1 bag of capers (15g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a large pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot


### Step 3

Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Wash and chop the red gem lettuce in half widthways and discard the stem

Cut the cherry tomatoes in half

Chop the black olives roughly


### Step 4

Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray and crush them gently with a fork

Sprinkle the capers over the crushed potatoes

Drizzle everything with olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a gentle mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min, or until golden and crisp


### Step 5

While the potatoes are cooking, add the eggs to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking!)

Boil for an initial 4 min

After 4 min add the green beans and boil for a further 3-4 min or until the beans are tender

Once done, drain and run everything under cold water


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the Dijon mustard and white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your Dijon vinaigrette


### Step 7

Add the chopped red gem lettuce, halved cherry tomatoes, black olives and cooked green beans to the Dijon vinaigrette and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your dressed salad

Peel the cooled eggs and cut them into quarters

Drain the canned tuna

### Step 8

Divide the dressed salad between your serving bowls and top with the canned tuna and egg quarters

Sprinkle over the crispy caper potatoes

Enjoy!
