## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Peel and chop half your red onion[s] into wedges (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 3

Add your meat-free sausages, chopped potato, chopped sweet potato and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until the meat-free sausages are cooked through and the potatoes are golden


### Step 4

Meanwhile, finely dice the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, most of your curry powder (save a little for garnish!) and your ground smoked paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Add your tomato paste, Henderson's Relish, tomato ketchup and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick gravy-like consistency – this is your curried tomato sauce

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside


### Step 7

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the shredded kale and massage it with clean hands so that it's evenly covered in oil

Once the sausages are cooked, remove the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven and sprinkle over the kale

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 3-4 min or until the kale is cooked and slightly crispy – this is your meat-free sausage tray bake

### Step 8

Return the curried tomato sauce to a low heat to reheat gently

Serve the meat-free sausage tray bake with the curried tomato sauce drizzled all over

Sprinkle over the remaining curry powder – this is your German-style curried meat-free sausage tray bake

Enjoy!
