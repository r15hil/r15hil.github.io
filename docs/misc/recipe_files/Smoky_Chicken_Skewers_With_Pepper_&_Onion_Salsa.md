## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes

### Step 2

Soak your skewers in cold water (this stops them from burning whilst cooking!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips, sliced onion and a pinch of salt, then cook for 2 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 min or until caramelised

### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut your chicken breast portion[s] into 2 strips per person, lengthways

Place the chicken strips in a large mixing bowl with your ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt, mix well to ensure the strips are coated

Thread each coated chicken strip onto a soaked skewer in a snake-like fashion and set aside

### Step 5

Once done, transfer the caramelised pepper & onion to a bowl and reserve the pan

Add half of your red wine vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) to the bowl with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir through the chopped coriander – this is your pepper & onion salsa

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1590501937217-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken skewers and cook for 4 min, turning so they brown on all sides

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, cover with a lid and cook for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your smoky chicken skewers

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1590501942862-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whilst the chicken is cooking, combine your mayo with the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl – this is your spicy mayo

### Step 8

Serve the smoky chicken skewers with the crispy potatoes, pepper & onion salsa and spicy mayo to the side

Enjoy!
