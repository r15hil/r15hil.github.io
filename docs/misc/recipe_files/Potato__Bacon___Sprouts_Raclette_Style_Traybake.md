## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a large, oven-proof dish (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the dish[es] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then cut in half

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your cider vinegar and mix it all together, then set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot


### Step 4

Add the grated cheese and chopped garlic to a pot with your cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk and a generous grind of black pepper and gently cook over a medium-low heat, stirring frequently

Cook for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your cheese sauce


### Step 5

After the initial 20 min, remove the dish[es] from the oven and add the halved Brussels sprouts and your bacon lardons

Drizzle with vegetable oil and return the dish[es] to the oven for a further 15 min or until the vegetables are cooked through and golden – this is your potato, bacon & sprouts traybake


### Step 6

Once the vegetables are golden, remove the dish[es] from the oven and pour the cheese sauce all over

Turn the grill on high and put the dish[es] under the grill for 5-6 min or until everything is golden and bubbling – this is your potato, bacon & sprouts raclette-style traybake


### Step 7

While the vegetables are cooking, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the salad and quick-pickled shallots in a bowl and mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled salad

### Step 8

Serve the potato, bacon & sprouts raclette-style traybake with the quick-pickled salad to the side

Enjoy!
