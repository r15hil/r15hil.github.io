## Ingredients

- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 x 125g British chicken breast fillets
- 2 fine egg noodle nests
- 50g solid coconut cream
- 15ml fish sauce
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 shallot
- 1 spring onion
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 lime
- 3 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of the lemongrass and chop the softer inner core roughly

Peel and roughly chop 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 2

Add the chopped onion, garlic and lemongrass to a food processor with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, ground turmeric, ground cinnamon and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and blitz into a smooth paste – this is your Khao Soi curry paste


### Step 3

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ Gas 4

Cut the chicken breasts into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice the remaining red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl and squeeze over the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime and set aside to pickle – this is your pickled shallot


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion and chopped chicken and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion has started to soften

Once the onion has started to soften, add the Khao Soi curry paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped coconut cream in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, then add the fish sauce and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken Khao Soi curry


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, reboil a kettle

Add the fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles then set aside to soak

After 1 min, remove approx. 1/4 of the noodles and transfer them to kitchen paper to dry – these are your partly soaked noodles

After 3 min further, drain the remaining soaked noodles, and set aside until serving


### Step 7

Add the partly soaked noodles to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy noodles

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Add the drained noodles to bowls and top with the chicken Khao Soi curry

Top with the pickled shallot, sliced spring onion and the crispy noodles

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
