## Ingredients

- Smoked sea salt flakes (1g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Double cream (80ml)
- Haddock bites (100g) x0
- Haddock bites (200g)
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato x2
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your tomato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 4

Melt 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter in a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk and your double cream into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 3-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 5

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Once the potatoes are tender, add the chopped haddock bites, cooked potatoes and chopped tomato to the béchamel sauce

Add a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your haddock filling


### Step 6

Transfer the haddock filling to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with the grated cheese and a grind of pepper

Put the dish[es] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until bubbling and golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your haddock smokie

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the haddock smokie is nearly ready, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once the haddock smokie is ready, remove the dish[es] from the oven and top with your smoked sea salt flakes

### Step 8

Serve the haddock smokie with the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!
