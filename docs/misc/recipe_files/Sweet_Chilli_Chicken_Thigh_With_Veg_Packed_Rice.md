## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the diced carrot and reduce the heat to very low, then cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 3

Combine your cornflour and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add your chicken thighs and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

While the chicken is browning, combine your honey, chilli relish and 30ml <span class="text-purple">[45ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60ml] </span>cold water in a small bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce


### Step 5

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Add the sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened


### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Once the rice is cooked, add the refreshed peas, black sesame seeds and remaining soy sauce and mix everything together – this is your veg-packed rice


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken with your toasted sesame seeds to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli chicken thigh

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed rice with the sweet chilli chicken thigh over the top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
