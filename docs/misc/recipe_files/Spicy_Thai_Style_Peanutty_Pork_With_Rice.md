## Description

Rich, spicy and nutty, this speedy stir fry has it all. You’ll pan fry pork mince before adding pepper, red onion and green beans. Simmer the lot in a spicy peanut sauce before serving with fluffy rice and extra peanuts to garnish. High in protein. Protein contributes to a growth in muscle mass.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince to the pan (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until nicely browned, breaking it up into large chunks with a wooden spoon

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into thin wedges

Trim your green beans

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Once the pork has browned, add the onion wedges to the pan with the sliced pepper and trimmed beans

Cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, or until the vegetables have softened and browned


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts


### Step 6

Combine your peanut butter with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and mix until fully combined

Add your red Thai curry paste with your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped garlic

Stir it all together – this is your peanut sauce


### Step 7

Once the vegetables have softened and browned, add the peanut sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened, the beans are tender with a bite and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy Thai-style peanutty pork

### Step 8

Serve the spicy Thai-style peanutty pork over the cooked rice

Top with the crushed peanuts

Enjoy!
