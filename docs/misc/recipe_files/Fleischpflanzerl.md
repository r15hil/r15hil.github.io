- 1 mixed salad punnet (100g)
- 5g fresh rosemary
- 1 British free range egg
- 400g potatoes
- 30g breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2 garlic cloves
- 
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 onion

## Instructions

### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks (approx. 5cm)


Add the potatoes and salt (optional) to a pot of boiling water and boil for 15 min or until you can just pierce them with a fork (finish cooking in step 6)

### Step 2

Meanwhile add the breadcrumbs to a bowl and cover with milk 


Peel the onion and chop very finely


Crush the garlic with the side of a knife, peel it and chop finely


Remove the rosemary's leaves and chop finely, discarding the stems

### Step 3

Drain the breadcrumbs and squeeze to get rid of excess liquid 


Combine the breadcrumbs, beef mince, tomato paste, oregano, garlic, half the Dijon mustard and a handful of onion to make the patty mix


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> on top and mix well


Season to your taste with salt and pepper

### Step 4

Make 6 <span class="text-danger">(12)</span> patties of equal size from the mix using your hands, flattening them so they are approx. 2-3cm thick discs


Tip: Wet your hands first to prevent the meat from sticking

### Step 5

Add 1-2 tbsp of butter or oil to a pan on a high heat


Once hot, add the patties and cook for 1 min on each side


Reduce the heat to prevent burning and cook the patties for a further 4-5 min on each side or until they are just cooked through


Set the pan aside for serving

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are done, drain them and cut into quarters


Add 1-2 tbsp of olive oil to a pan on a medium heat


Once the oil is hot, add the potatoes and cook for 10 min or until browned on all sides


Sprinkle with rosemary and season to your taste with salt and pepper

### Step 7

Place the lettuce in a bowl and add 1-2 tbsp of olive oil


Season to your taste with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Arrange the patties and potatoes on plates
