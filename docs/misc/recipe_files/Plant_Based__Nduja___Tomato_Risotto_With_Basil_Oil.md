### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop into bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, set aside for later and reserve the pan

### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Whilst the onion is softening, add the chopped courgette and your cherry tomatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until softened

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and your plant based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

### Step 6

Add the tomato stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks, then grind the chopped basil with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste and add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with the olive oil

### Step 7

Once cooked, stir the roasted veg through the risotto with your umami seasoning, a small knob of butter and a grind of black pepper – this is your plant-based 'Nduja & tomato risotto

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based 'Nduja & tomato risotto topped with the toasted pine nuts

Drizzle the basil oil over the top

Enjoy!
