## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 1 x 300g British baby gammon joint
- 25g honey
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Chop the waxy potatoes into bite-sized pieces


Cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)


### Step 2

Add the onion wedges and chopped potatoes to a baking tray and add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt


Give everything a good mix up and push to one side of the tray


### Step 3

Cut out a large sheet of tin foil, place the gammon in the middle and scrunch up the edges so that any cooking juices can be collected


Add the gammon to the other side of the tray


Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the potatoes are starting to brown


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine the wholegrain mustard and honey in a bowl – this is your honey mustard glaze


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are starting to brown, spoon the honey mustard glaze over the gammon and cook for 15 min further or until the gammon is cooked through and the glaze is sticky


Tip: keep the gammon cooking juices as these will make your dressing!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice the cherry tomatoes in half


Add a drizzle of olive oil to the gammon cooking juices so that it resembles a dressing-like consistency


### Step 7

Slice the gammon finely


Tip: tear each piece of sliced gammon in half to create an interesting texture!


Carefully cut off the onion root and remove the skins


Add the cherry tomatoes, crispy potatoes, lamb's lettuce, onion petals, gammon and the cooking juices to a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your warm honey mustard gammon &amp; tomato salad

### Step 8

Serve the warm honey mustard gammon &amp; tomato salad


Enjoy!
