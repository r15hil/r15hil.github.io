### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges and slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the onion wedges and halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

After an initial 2-3 min, add the spinach to the pan with the basa and cook, covered, for a further 2 min or until the spinach has started to wilt and the basa is cooked through â€“ this your curried basa, cherry tomato & spinach soup

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the medium egg noodles in a bowl and pour over the curried basa, cherry tomato & spinach soup

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
