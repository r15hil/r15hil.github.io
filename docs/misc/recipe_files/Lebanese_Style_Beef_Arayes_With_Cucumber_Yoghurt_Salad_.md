### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-16 min or until the wedges are slightly golden

### Step 2

While the wedges are in the oven, cut your wholemeal pitta[s] in half

Slice the pitta halves open carefully with a knife, so you create a pocket – these are your pitta pockets

Tip: Don't worry if you tear the bread a little!

### Step 3

Peel and grate your garlic

Peel and finely slice half your shallot[s]

Dice the remaining shallot finely

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stems (save a few leaves for garnish)

### Step 4

Combine your beef mince in a bowl with half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!), the diced shallot and chopped parsley

Add your beef stock mix and baharat with your pomegranate molasses and mix thoroughly until fully combined – this is your arayes mixture

Divide the arayes mixture equally between the pitta pockets

Close the pitta pockets and press down firmly – these are your beef arayes

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef arayes, cut side down to the pan and cook for 2 min or until lightly browned

Once lightly browned, cook the arayes on each side for 1 min or until golden

### Step 6

Once lightly browned, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push the wedges to one side

Add the browned arayes to the other side and return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-14 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Lebanese-style beef arayes

### Step 7

Meanwhile, bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Combine the smashed cucumber with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), sliced shallot and natural yoghurt in a bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a crack of black pepper – this is your cucumber yoghurt salad

### Step 8

Serve the Lebanese-style beef arayes with the wedges and cucumber yoghurt salad to the side

Garnish with the reserved parsley

Enjoy!
