## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped


### Step 3

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add your chopped potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 4

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into rings

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Once the chorizo has started to crisp, add the sliced onion, sliced pepper and sliced garlic with your bay leaf[ves], tomato paste, red wine paste and 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your chorizo al vino


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!), a knob of butter and a small pinch of salt and pepper – these are your parsley potatoes


### Step 7

Combine the roasted garlic paste (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and mayo in a bowl with a splash of cold water and season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your roasted garlic mayo

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve your chorizo al vino with the parsley potatoes and salad to the side

Dress your salad with your white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Drizzle the roasted garlic mayo all over

Enjoy!
