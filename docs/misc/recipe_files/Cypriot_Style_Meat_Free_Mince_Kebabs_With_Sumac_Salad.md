### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel your red onion[s] and slice half very finely

Finely dice (or grate) the remaining red onion

Chop half your parsley finely, including the stalks (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!), diced onion, chopped garlic, chopped parsley, dried oregano and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

### Step 3

Divide the meat-free mince mixture and roll into 3 small sausage shapes per person – these are your Cypriot-style meat-free mince kebabs

Lightly oil a baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil and add the Cypriot-style meat-free mince kebabs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the kebabs are cooked through and browned

### Step 4

Whilst the kebabs are cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice roughly on a diagonal

Dice your tomato[es]

Roughly tear the remaining parsley

### Step 5

Add your wholemeal pitta to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your chilli pitta

### Step 6

Roll your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 7

Add the sliced cucumber, diced tomato, sliced onion and torn parsley to a large bowl

Add your natural yoghurt with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of half the lemon[s], half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and cut the chilli pitta in half

### Step 8

Serve the Cypriot-style meat-free mince kebabs with the sumac salad and warmed chilli pitta to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining ground sumac and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
