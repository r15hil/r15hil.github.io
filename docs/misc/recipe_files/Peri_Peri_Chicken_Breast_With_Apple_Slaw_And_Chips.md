## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


### Step 3

Combine your tomato paste, dried oregano, white wine vinegar, chopped garlic, chipotle paste and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] in a bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt, then mix to combine – this is your peri peri sauce


### Step 4

Add half of the peri peri sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate bowl with your chicken breast portion[s] and mix well until fully coated

Transfer the coated chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, combine the remaining peri peri sauce with your mayo – this is your perinaise


### Step 6

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your apple[s] (skin on) into matchsticks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely, keeping the whites and greens separate


### Step 7

Combine the grated carrot, apple matchsticks, sliced spring onion whites and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>of the perinaise (save the rest for later!) in a bowl – this is your apple slaw

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Slice the peri peri chicken finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced peri peri chicken with the chips, apple slaw and remaining perinaise to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion greens and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
