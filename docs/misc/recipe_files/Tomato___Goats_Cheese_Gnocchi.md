### Step 7

Add the drained gnocchi to the pan with a small splash of starchy cooking water and the chopped basil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the gnocchi – this is your tomato gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the tomato gnocchi

Crumble your goats' cheese all over the gnocchi and top with your salad

Drizzle with some olive oil, season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
