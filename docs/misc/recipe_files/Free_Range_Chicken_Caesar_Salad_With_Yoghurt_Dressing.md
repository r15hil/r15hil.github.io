## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)

- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Italian hard cheese (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 2

Add the free range chicken breast portion[s] and red onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano over the chicken

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the onion wedges are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, rip your ciabatta[s] into rough bite-sized pieces

Add the torn ciabatta to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy – these are your croutons


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Shave half of your Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese finely


### Step 5

Combine the chopped shallot, chopped garlic (don’t like raw garlic? Use half!), Dijon mustard, natural yoghurt and half the grated Italian hard cheese (you’ll use the rest later!) with your white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your yoghurt Caesar dressing


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and tear into rough bite-sized pieces

Once everything's cooked, separate the red onion wedges into petals

Add the torn lettuce, remaining grated Italian hard cheese, croutons and red onion petals to a large mixing bowl

Add the yoghurt Caesar dressing and give everything a good mix until evenly coated in the dressing


### Step 7

Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced chicken over the salad – this is your free range chicken Caesar salad with yoghurt dressing

### Step 8

Serve the free range chicken Caesar salad with yoghurt dressing topped with the Italian hard cheese shavings and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
