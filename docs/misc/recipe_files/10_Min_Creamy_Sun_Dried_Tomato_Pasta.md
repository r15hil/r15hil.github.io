## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 80g coconut yoghurt
- 120g quick cook amorini

- 1 bag of pine nuts (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pine nuts and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, transfer them to a bowl and set aside for later


### Step 3

Whilst the pine nuts are toasting, halve the cherry tomatoes


### Step 4

Dissolve the sun-dried tomato paste and coconut yoghurt in 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>boiled water – this is your sun-dried tomato stock


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium-high heat

Add the sun-dried tomato stock, halved cherry tomatoes, quick-cook amorini and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for an initial 2 min


### Step 6

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Wash the baby leaf spinach


### Step 7

Add the drained cannellini beans and washed spinach to the pan and stir it all together

Cook, covered, for 3 min further or until the pasta is cooked through – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato pasta

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato pasta and garnish with the pine nuts

Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
