## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a full kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a drizzle of olive oil and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the macaroni and save 120ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[135ml]</span> [150ml]</span> starchy pasta water (save the pot for later!)


### Step 3

Meanwhile, combine the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, tomato ketchup, tomato paste, pomegranate molasses and half of your mustard ketchup (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> brown sugar in a bowl

Add 25ml <span class="text-purple">[40ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [50ml]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your Kansas-style BBQ sauce


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Season your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 5

While the chicken is browning, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a knob of butter and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until you have a sandy paste

Add your soft cheese, remaining mustard ketchup, drained macaroni and most of the grated cheddar cheese (save enough for the topping!)

Add the starchy pasta water, give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cheesy macaroni


### Step 6

Transfer the cheesy macaroni to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with the remaining grated cheddar

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is the daddy mac 'n' cheese

Tip: The cheese sauce will thicken in the oven!


### Step 7

Add the Kansas-style BBQ sauce to the pan with the browned chicken, give everything a good mix up and increase the heat to high

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened to a jam like consistency

Transfer the Kansas-style BBQ chicken to a baking tray lined with tin foil, layer any remaining sauce over the chicken and put it in the oven for 12-14 min until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 8

Once done, slice the Kansas-style BBQ chicken on a clean chopping board

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop into wedges

Serve the sliced Kansas-style BBQ chicken with the daddy mac 'n' cheese and lettuce wedges to the side

Add a little drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper to the lettuce wedges and enjoy!
