## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a small pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until cooked through and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully


### Step 3

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 4

Wash, then chop your radishes in half

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!


### Step 5

Combine your rice vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a medium bowl with the chopped radish and cucumber – this is your quick-pickled veg

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways


### Step 6

Combine the juice of your orange[s] in a bowl with your cornflour, then add your soy sauce, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a pinch of salt and 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>cold water – this is your ponzu-style sauce

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the ponzu-style sauce and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a syrup-like consistency, then set aside to cool – this is your ponzu-style glaze


### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your toasted sesame seeds

Give everything a good mix up, then return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a further 2-3 min – this is your sesame sweet potato

Combine your mayo and miso paste in a bowl with a small splash of pickling liquid from the quick-pickled veg – this is your miso mayo

### Step 8

Serve the cooked sushi rice and layer over the shredded lettuce, sliced avocado, sesame sweet potato and quick-pickled veg

Drizzle over the ponzu-style glaze and miso mayo

Enjoy!
