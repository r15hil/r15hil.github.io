### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 2

Wash your leek[s] carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the sliced leek to the pan

Add a couple of splashes of water, your Chinese rice wine, half of the chopped garlic and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with a lid and cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a baking paper-lined baking tray with the grated cheese, remaining chopped garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until golden – this is your cheesy crumb

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Transfer the pulled chicken back to the pan

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through your crème fraîche

Add the drained linguine with a splash of the starchy pasta water and the chicken stock mix

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy chicken linguine

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken linguine in bowls and sprinkle the cheesy crumb all over the top

Garnish with the chopped basil and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
