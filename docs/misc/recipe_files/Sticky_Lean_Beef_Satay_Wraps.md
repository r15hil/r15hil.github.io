## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Spoon off and discard any excess fat that may come out of the meat


### Step 3

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)


### Step 4

Once the lean beef mince has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste, honey, Chinese rice wine, half your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until the lean beef mince has caramelised and is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky lean beef


### Step 5

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice into batons


### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Combine your peanut butter, red chilli relish, remaining soy sauce, the juice of your lime[s], a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your satay sauce

### Step 8

Divide the sticky lean beef between the warmed tortillas and top with the grated carrot and cucumber batons

Drizzle over the satay sauce and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
