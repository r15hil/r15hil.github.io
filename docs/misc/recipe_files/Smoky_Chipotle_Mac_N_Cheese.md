### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced peppers and cook, covered, for 4-5 min

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for a further 4-5 min

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 7 min or until it's cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the macaroni, reserving 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span>[300ml]</span> of starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste, drained macaroni, crème fraîche, grated cheese and vegetable stock to the pan

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chipotle mac 'n' cheese

### Step 7

Transfer the chipotle mac 'n' cheese to an oven-proof dish

Top with the smoky breadcrumbs and put the dish in the oven for 10 min or until bubbling and crispy

Tip: Use individual oven dishes for fancy presentation!

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Remove the smoky chipotle mac 'n' cheese from the oven and leave to stand until cooled slightly (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the smoky chipotle mac 'n' cheese 

Enjoy!
