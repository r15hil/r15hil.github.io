Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

### Step 2

Cut 2<span class="text-danger"> [4] </span>pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the chopped peppers to the middle with the crushed garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the pepper to form 1<span class="text-danger"> [2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the pepper has softened

### Step 3

Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine, reserving 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> starchy pasta water

### Step 4

While the peppers are in the oven, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add the flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl and reserve the pan

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper, then blitz until you have a coarse paste – this is your roasted red pepper sauce

### Step 7

Return the courgettes to the heat and once hot, add the roasted red pepper sauce, vegetable stock mix and pitted black olives to the pan with the drained linguine

Add the reserved starchy pasta water and a generous crack of black pepper, then give everything a good mix up and cook for 2 min further – this is your saucy roasted red pepper & olive linguine

### Step 8

Serve the saucy roasted red pepper & olive linguine in bowls
