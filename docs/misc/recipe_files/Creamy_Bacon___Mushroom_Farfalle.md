## Ingredients

- Crème fraîche (80g)
- British bacon lardons (50g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- British bacon lardons (100g)
- Garlic clove
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Farfalle (200g)
- Farfalle (100g) x0
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and sliced mushrooms and cook for 6-8 min or until the bacon is cooked through and crisp, then transfer to a plate (reserve the pan and any juices for later!) – these are your crispy lardons & mushrooms


### Step 3

While the lardons and mushrooms are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any cooking juices and a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant and softened


### Step 6

While the onion is softening, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the cooked farfalle and crispy lardons & mushrooms to the pan and stir it all together


### Step 7

Add the chicken stock with your crème fraîche and a generous grind of black pepper and give it a good mix up until everything is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy bacon & mushroom farfalle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy bacon & mushroom farfalle and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
