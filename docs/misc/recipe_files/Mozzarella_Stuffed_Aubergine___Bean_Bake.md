## Ingredients

- 20g rocket
- 32g tomato paste
- 390g cannellini beans
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 210g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 10g basil
- 125g mozzarella
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 aubergines
- 30g pumpkin seeds
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail and slice the aubergines lengthways into roughly 1cm thick slices

Chop any leftover pieces of aubergine roughly


### Step 2

Add the aubergine slices to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle each with olive oil and season with salt and pepper (save the roughly chopped aubergine for later!)

Tip: Try to spread the aubergine slices out as much as you can!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 18-20 min or until the aubergine slices are tender

Once cooked, remove from the oven and set aside to cool


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml] </span>boiled water and add the dried oregano, balsamic vinegar and tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Wash the rocket, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, any roughly chopped aubergine and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Add the tomato stock, chopped tomatoes and drained cannellini beans and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened slightly


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop the basil roughly, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the aubergine slices are cool enough to handle, sprinkle over some chopped basil (save the rest for later!) and add a few pieces of torn mozzarella at one end of each slice

Roll up the loaded aubergine slices so the filling is encased – these are your mozzarella-stuffed aubergine rolls


### Step 7

Add the tomato & bean sauce to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Push the mozzarella-stuffed aubergine rolls into the sauce and sprinkle over the pumpkin seeds and any remaining chopped basil

Put the dish<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until bubbling – this is your mozzarella-stuffed aubergine & bean bake

### Step 8

Serve the mozzarella-stuffed aubergine & bean bake with the rocket to the side

Enjoy!
