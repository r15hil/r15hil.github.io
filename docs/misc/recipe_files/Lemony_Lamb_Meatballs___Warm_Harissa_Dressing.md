### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard the watery seeds

Slice the cucumber finely and add it to a sieve over the sink

Season with a generous pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up and set aside until later – this is your salted cucumber

### Step 2

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 3

Meanwhile, zest your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Add the lemon zest, chopped garlic, lamb mince, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the mixture and roll them into 6 meatballs per person

### Step 5

Add the meatballs to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your lemony lamb meatballs

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl – this is your harissa dressing

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the lemony lamb meatballs from the oven and add them to the bowl of harissa dressing

Gently mix the meatballs into the dressing until fully coated – these are your dressed lamb meatballs

Rinse the salted cucumber under cold running water and shake off any excess liquid

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the bulgur wheat with your natural yoghurt to the side (spread the yoghurt out with the back of a spoon)

Top with the salted cucumber and dressed lamb meatballs

Drizzle over any remaining dressing, garnish with the chopped herbs and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
