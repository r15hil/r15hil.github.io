### Step 1

Boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of sugar and salt and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give it a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice blend

### Step 5

Peel and grate your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with your soft cheese and grated garlic – this is your creamy garlic stock

### Step 6

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir it into the sauce around the chicken, so the flour soaks up the juices, then add the creamy garlic stock

### Step 7

Drain and rinse your sweetcorn and butter beans and add them to the pan

Roughly tear half of your basil (save some for garnish!) into the pan and season with a generous crack of black pepper and a pinch of salt

Mix everything together and cook covered, stirring occasionally, for 12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Cajun-style chicken breast & sweetcorn casserole

### Step 8

Serve the Cajun-style chicken breast & sweetcorn casserole in a bowl

Tear the remaining basil over the top and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
