## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix
- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp dried sage
- 160g Chantenay carrots
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 x British chicken breast portions
- 8g Marmite
- 120g shredded spring greens
- 25g honey
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the potatoes and Chantenay carrots to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim and finely chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Dissolve half the chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Add a knob of butter to a large bowl with the chopped garlic, chopped spring onion, dried sage, panko breadcrumbs and chicken stock and stir it all together, then set aside to absorb – this is your stuffing mixture


### Step 3

Divide the stuffing mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> stuffing balls and add them to a baking tray with the chicken breast portions

Drizzle the chicken with olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, heat a small pan with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Dissolve the remaining chicken stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>boiled water and add to the pan with the Marmite

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your gravy


### Step 5

Remove the tray of potatoes and Chantenay carrots from the oven and drizzle the honey over the carrots

Return the tray to the oven and cook for 3-4 min further until the potatoes are crisp and the carrots are tender – these are your roast potatoes and honey-roasted carrots


### Step 6

Wash the shredded spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the shredded spring greens and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Season with a pinch of salt – these are your buttery greens

### Step 8

Serve the cooked chicken with the roast potatoes, honey-roasted carrots, stuffing balls and buttery greens to the side

Pour the gravy all over and enjoy!
