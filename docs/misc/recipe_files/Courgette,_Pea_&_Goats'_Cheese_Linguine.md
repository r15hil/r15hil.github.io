Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Serve the courgette, pea & goats' cheese linguine and crumble over the remaining goats' cheese

Serve the salad to the side and season with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint, lemon wedge and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
