### Step 2

Heat a pot (with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, creamed coconut and red Thai curry paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Thai stock

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your basmati rice and the Thai stock to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your red Thai curry rice

### Step 5

Combine your soy sauce and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with the chopped basil, chopped garlic and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your chilli & basil dressing

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your cod fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season them with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add the cod fillet[s] to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Combine the grated carrot and half the chilli & basil dressing (save the rest for later!) in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your carrot salad

### Step 8

Serve the cooked cod over the red Thai curry rice and drizzle over the remaining chilli & basil dressing

Serve the carrot salad to the side

Enjoy!
