## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife, then remove the skins and chop roughly

Add the chopped garlic to the dish with your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Add your chicken stock mix with your chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 5

Once boiling, add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar to the dish with your farfalle


### Step 6

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the pasta has been cooking for 25 min, remove the dish from the oven

Stir through your grated Italian hard cheese with a knob of butter – this is your oven baked spicy bacon arrabbiata farfalle

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To serve, tear your basil leaves into the oven baked spicy bacon arrabbiata farfalle

Garnish with the salad and season with a grind of pepper

Dig in!
