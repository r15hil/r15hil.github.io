### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Peel the garlic<span class="text-highlight">,&nbsp;then peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces </span>


<span class="text-highlight">Add the potatoes and&nbsp;peeled&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;to a pot of plenty of&nbsp;boiled water with a pinch of salt&nbsp;</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return them to the pot</span>


### Step 2

Meanwhile, re-boil a kettle


Roll each piece of pork tenderloin in 2 rashers of smoked streaky bacon


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the wrapped pork&nbsp;to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until browned&nbsp;


Tip: turn the pork very gently so the bacon doesn't fall off&nbsp;


### Step 4

Once browned, transfer the pork&nbsp;to an oiled baking tray (reserve the pan for step 7!)&nbsp;


Drizzle the honey over the pork &nbsp;and put in the oven for 7-9<span class="text-highlight"> min</span> or until cooked through&nbsp;


Once done, remove from the oven and leave to rest until serving

### Step 5

Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up &amp; slice into thin strips


Add the sliced spring greens to a pot of plenty of boiling water with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender


Once tender, drain and set aside until serving


### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk and a large knob of butter


Mash until smooth


### Step 7

Pour away most of the&nbsp;oil from the pork tenderloin&nbsp;pan, leaving around 1 tsp<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;in the pan


Return the pan to a medium heat and add the clotted cream, wholegrain mustard and a generous grind of black pepper


Cook for 1 min, whisking&nbsp;until fully combined &ndash; this is your&nbsp;wholegrain mustard sauce&nbsp;

### Step 8

Slice the pork tenderloin pieces in half


Serve the&nbsp;pork tenderloin over the wholegrain mustard sauce with the mashed potato and spring greens to the side&nbsp;


Enjoy!
