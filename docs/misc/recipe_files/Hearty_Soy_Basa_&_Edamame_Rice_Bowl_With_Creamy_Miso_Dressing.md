### Step 5

Add the remaining soy sauce and remaining rice vinegar to a large bowl with a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of sugar and salt

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until lightly charred and cooked through – this is your soy basa

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked and the green beans are tender, add the edamame beans to the pot with a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your edamame rice

### Step 8

Serve the edamame rice, topped with the soy basa

Drizzle with the creamy miso dressing and top with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
