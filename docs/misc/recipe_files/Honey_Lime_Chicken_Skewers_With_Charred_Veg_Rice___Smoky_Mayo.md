### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, soak the skewers in water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Peel and cut the red onion <span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 3

Combine the honey with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime in a bowl

Add the ground coriander, half the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your zesty marinade

Chop the chicken thighs into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken thighs, chopped green pepper and onion wedges to the zesty marinade and give everything a good mix up

### Step 4

Thread the marinated chicken onto the soaked skewers

Add the marinated pepper and onion wedges to tin foil-lined tray and place in the oven for 12-14 min or until slightly charred – this is your charred veg

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the mayo to a small bowl with the remaining lime juice and the remaining smoked paprika

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky mayo

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken skewers and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked though (no pink meat!) – these are your honey-lime chicken skewers

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1644935069277-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, stir the vegetable stock mix and charred veg through the basmati rice – this is your charred veg rice

### Step 8

Serve the honey-lime chicken skewers over the charred veg rice with the smoky mayo to the side

Enjoy!
