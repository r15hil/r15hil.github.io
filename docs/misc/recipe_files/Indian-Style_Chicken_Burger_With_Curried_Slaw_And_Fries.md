### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until starting to crisp – these are your paprika fries

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your chicken thighs to a bowl with your ground cumin, garam masala and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

### Step 4

Once browned, transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken

### Step 6

Once the fries have been in the oven for an initial 25 min, move them to one side of the tray[s] and add your ciabatta[s] to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the ciabatta is hot and toasted

Carefully slice the toasted ciabatta[s] in half before serving

Serve the paprika fries and remaining curried slaw to the side

Enjoy!
