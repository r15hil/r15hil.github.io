### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, stir the arborio rice into the pan, making sure the grains of rice are coated in oil

Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until it has evaporated

Reduce the heat to medium-low

### Step 4

Add 1/3 of the creamy stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed into the rice

Continue to add the remaining creamy stock, a ladle at a time, stirring more or less continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto

Tear the smoked mackerel into small, rough pieces (watch out for small bones!)

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon

Season very generously with pepper (use much more than you normally would!) – this is your dairy-free smoked mackerel & lemon risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Serve the dairy-free smoked mackerel & lemon risotto in bowls topped with a handful of pea shoots and a lemon wedge

Drizzle the pea shoots with olive oil

Enjoy!
