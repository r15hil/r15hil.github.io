## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your plant based 'Nduja and the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[275ml]</span> boiled water, your vegetable stock mix and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Bring to the boil, then cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large pot of boiled water over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Break your lasagne sheets into medium-sized pieces and add them to the boiling water, stirring to separate the pasta pieces – this is your torn lasagne

Cook for 4-5 min, stirring from time to time to prevent the pasta from sticking, then drain the cooked lasagne


### Step 5

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the sauce has thickened, add the spinach and cook for 1 min or until wilted

Once wilted, add the cooked lasagne with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Drizzle over your double cream, then sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese with a grind of pepper

Put the lid on and cook for a final 2 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your torn veggie ‘Nduja lasagne


### Step 7

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the torn veggie ‘Nduja lasagne and sprinkle over the chopped parsley

Serve the salad to the side with a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!
