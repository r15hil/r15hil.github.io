## Ingredients

- Lemon
- British skin-on chicken thighs (160g) x0
- Tomato
- British skin-on chicken thighs (320g)
- Courgette
- Mini cosberg lettuce
- Green tomato chutney (20g)
- Pumpkin seeds (15g)
- Yellow pepper
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the grill to high

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] on a diagonal

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips


### Step 2

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Slice your tomato[es] into wedges


### Step 3

Add the courgette slices, pepper strips, tomato wedges and onion wedges to a large tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] under the grill for 8-10 min or until softened and charred – these are your grilled vegetables


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, then pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them with a generous pinch of salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for an initial 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

Once browned, reduce heat to medium-high then turn the chicken thighs and cook them for a further 8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

In a small bowl, combine your green tomato chutney with the juice of half your lemon[s], 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your green tomato dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Once the chicken thighs are cooked, transfer them to a clean board and slice into strips – this is your sliced crispy chicken


### Step 7

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Divide the shredded lettuce evenly

### Step 8

Top the shredded lettuce with the grilled vegetables

Serve the sliced crispy chicken over the vegetables

Drizzle everything with the green tomato dressing and garnish with your pumpkin seeds and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
