## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 1 tomato
- 300g sweet potatoes
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 
- 1 tbsp chipotle paste
- 300g potatoes
- 50g stilton cheese
- 1 mayonnaise sachet 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Wash and cut the white potatoes into 3cm cubes


Add them to a large pot with a matching lid on a high heat with enough (salted) boiled water to cover by 2 inches


### Step 2

Bring the water to a boil on a high heat and boil the potatoes with a lid on for 8 min


Meanwhile, wash and cut the sweet potatoes into 3cm cubes


Set aside a mixing bowl large enough to fit both the white and sweet potatoes for step 4


### Step 3

Add the sweet potatoes to the pot after 8 min and boil both uncovered for a further 5 min, to soften slightly


Meanwhile, crumble the blue cheese into a bowl with the vinegar and mash together into a rough paste


Mix in the mayonnaise, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> (2 tbsp)</span> of milk and pepper to taste


This is your blue cheese dressing


### Step 4

Drain the white and sweet potatoes in a sieve and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle, then shake dry


Add both to the mixing bowl and coat them in the chipotle paste and then in 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(8 tbsp)</span> of flour, before crushing them gently with a potato masher


Season with salt and pepper, shape into 4 <span class="text-danger">(8)</span> patties &amp; dust in flour to seal


### Step 5

Heat a large non-stick frying pan with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(4 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil on a high heat


When hot, add the cakes and cook on each side for 3 min until golden brown


Tip: Press the cakes down slightly with a spatula (or similar) after turning to flatten them into an even shape&nbsp;


### Step 6

Once browned, transfer the cakes to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and season with salt and pepper to your taste


Put it in the oven for 10-15 min, or until the cakes are crispy&nbsp;


Add the pecans to a separate baking dish and put them in the oven for 5 min, or until darkened slightly in colour&nbsp;


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash and shred the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Roughly chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">(es)&nbsp;</span>


Roughly chop (or bash up in a bowl with a rolling pin) the cooled pecans&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the crispy cakes over the lettuce and tomato with the blue cheese dressing drizzled over


Scatter with toasted pecans&nbsp;


Enjoy!
