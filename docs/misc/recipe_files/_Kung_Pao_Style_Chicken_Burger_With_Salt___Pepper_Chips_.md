Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your salt & pepper chips

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden

Transfer the chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Kung Pao-style chicken

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel and chop the orange[s] into small pieces, discard the peel

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with the shredded lettuce, orange pieces, your mayo and a pinch of salt then mix well – this is your zingy slaw

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to the chip tray[s], and return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

To build, pile a spoonful of zingy slaw onto each warmed brioche base, then add the Kung Pao-style chicken and top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your Kung Pao-style chicken burger

Serve the salt & pepper chips and remaining zingy slaw to the side

Garnish the chips with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
