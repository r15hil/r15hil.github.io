## Ingredients

- 1 Chinese style pancakes
- 1 pak choi
- 1 udon noodles
- 0 agave nectar
- 1 Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms
- 1 Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms
- 1 five-spice mix
- 1 soy sauce
- 1 dried chilli flakes
- 1 ginger & garlic paste
- 1 hoisin sauce
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 hoisin sauce
- 1 cucumber
- 1 spring greens
- 3 spring onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your chilli flakes to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[11/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your chilli oil

Trim, then slice your spring onions in half, then into thin strips

Slice your cucumber in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds with a spoon then slice into matchsticks, discard the seeds


### Step 2

Meanwhile, bash your Fable pulled mushrooms with a rolling pin to break them up

Add the bashed Fable pulled mushrooms to an oven-proof dish with your five-spice mix, half your soy sauce and 120ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [195ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 18 min or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the mushrooms are slightly crisp


### Step 3

Re-boil a kettle

While the fable mushrooms are in the oven, wash, then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base[s] and green tops

Add your hoisin sauce to a small bowl with a tiny splash of cold water to loosen it


### Step 4

Wash your spring greens, then rip the leaves off, discard the tough stalks, and layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to a large baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[11/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a large drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Set aside for later


### Step 5

Add your udon noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soak for 4-5 min

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving 80ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>of<span class="text-danger"> </span>starchy noodle water

Combine the remaining soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and reserved starchy noodle water with a pinch of sugar – this is your soy stock


### Step 6

When the fable have 8 min left, remove the dish from the oven and stir through the agave, then return the dish to the oven along with the sliced spring greens for 7-8 min or until crispy – this is your 'seaweed' & five-spice fable mushrooms

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pak choi white base[s] and cook for a 1-2 min or until slightly softened


### Step 7

Once slightly softened, increase the heat to high and add the soy stock and cook for 1 min further, then add the drained udon noodles to the pan with the pak choi green tops

Cook for 2-3 min or until the noodles are coated in sauce – these are your Shanghai-style noodles

Place the Chinese-style pancakes (still in their bag) in the microwave and heat for 30 secs

### Step 8

Stir half the five-spice fable mushrooms through the noodles

Serve the remaining five-spice fable mushrooms with the cucumber matchsticks and sliced spring onions in your steamed pancakes with hoisin sauce

Serve the Shanghai-style noodles in a bowl with the chilli oil drizzled over and the 'seaweed' to the side – this is your Chinese banquet with 5-spice fable mushrooms and noodles

Enjoy!
