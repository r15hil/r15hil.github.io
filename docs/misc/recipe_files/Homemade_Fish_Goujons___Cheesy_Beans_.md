## Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Slice your basa fillet[s] in half lengthways

Slice each half into 2 pieces (roughly the size and shape of fish fingers) so that you are left with 4 basa strips per person

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a small bowl

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix together (this will make your breadcrumbs golden!)

### Step 4

Season the basa strips with a pinch of salt, then coat them in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

Add the breaded fish strips to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 14-15 min or until cooked through and golden – these are your homemade fish goujons

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 5

Whilst the fish goujons are cooking, boil half a kettle

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with your chopped tomatoes, Henderson’s Relish, vegetable stock, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – these are your beans

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1648027885430-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whilst the beans are thickening, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

Serve the homemade fish goujons with the beans and potato wedges to the side

Top the beans with the remaining grated cheese and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
