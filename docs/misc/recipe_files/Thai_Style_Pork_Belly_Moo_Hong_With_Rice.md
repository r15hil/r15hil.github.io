- British pork belly (300g)
- Rice vinegar (15ml)

- White long grain rice (130g)
- Fresh root ginger (15g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and heat a dry large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a medium heat (make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil)

Once hot, add your coriander seeds, cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant (careful they don’t burn!), then set aside (reserve the pan!)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Chop your pork belly into bite-sized pieces

Return the hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pork belly with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until browned on all sides


### Step 3

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Add the toasted coriander seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind to a fine powder

Add the crushed garlic, chopped ginger and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pestle & mortar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Grind to a paste - this is your coriander & garlic paste


### Step 5

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs


### Step 6

Once your pork belly has browned, add the coriander & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your cornflour, ketjap manis, rice vinegar, star anise, chopped carrot and chopped onion with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[500ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil then put in the oven, covered, for an initial 15 min


### Step 7

Once the pork has been cooking for an initial 15 min, add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

### Step 8

Serve your Thai-style pork belly moo hong with the baked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the reserved chopped coriander

Enjoy!
