## Ingredients

- 120g meat-free bacon rashers
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 160g blanched peas
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 5g mint
- 50g pea shoots

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Add the waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-5 min <span class="text-danger">[6-8 min]</span> or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large-wide based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free bacon and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crispy


### Step 4

While the meat-free bacon is cooking, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Combine the Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, chopped mint, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl

Season generously with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Dijon & mint dressing


### Step 6

Once the bacon is done, remove it from the pan and chop it roughly

Return the pan to a medium heat with the blanched peas and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are done, cut any larger ones in half

Add the cooked potatoes, warmed peas, crispy bacon and half of the pea shoots (save the rest to garnish on top!) to the Dijon & mint dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your plant-based bacon, potato & pea salad

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based bacon, potato & pea salad and top with the remaining pea shoots

Enjoy!
