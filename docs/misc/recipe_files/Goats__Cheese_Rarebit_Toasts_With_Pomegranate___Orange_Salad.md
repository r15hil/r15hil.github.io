### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add your wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate[s], then slice into quarters

Add the pomegranate quarters to a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and return to the large bowl

### Step 3

Cut the top and bottom off your orange[s], then cut the skin away from the flesh and discard the skin

Slice the orange flesh into rounds

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Combine the chopped thyme leaves and honey in a small bowl – this is your thyme honey

Add the goats' cheese mixture to a pot with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and bring to a boil over a medium heat

Add your pumpkin seeds to the other side of the baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until everything is toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!
