### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Slice the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a knob of butter and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil


### Step 2

Once the butter has melted, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the leek and dried dill with a pinch of salt


Cook for 2-3 min or until slightly browned


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the linguine to a large pot of boiling water over a high heat with a big pinch of salt


Cook for 7-8 min or until partially cooked (the linguine will finish cooking later on)


Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Add the garlic to the leek and cook for 1 min, then remove the pan from the heat


### Step 5

Top and tail the runner beans and cut into bite-size pieces


Chop the chives finely&nbsp;


Grate the cheese


### Step 6

Add the runner beans to the linguine and cook for a further 1 min or until the beans are just cooked but retaining colour and a slight crunch


Reserve a ladle of starchy pasta water, then drain the pasta and beans


Meanwhile, return the leek pan to a medium heat


### Step 7

Add the spinach and half the chives to the leek and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted slightly, mixing through to combine


Remove the pan from the heat, add the drained linguine, clotted cream and half the cheese

### Step 8

Stir everything together, adding 2-3 tbsp starchy pasta water to loosen it


Season the linguine generously with salt and pepper, scatter over the remaining chives and cheese and drizzle with olive oil


Enjoy!
