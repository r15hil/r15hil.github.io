## Ingredients

- Crispy onions (15g)
- Bread Roll x2
- Meatless Farm sausages (6pcs)
- Rocket (20g)
- Mustard ketchup (20g) x2
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- White potato x3
- Cider vinegar (30ml)
- Sweet pepper relish (20g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up


### Step 2

Add your meat-free sausages to the other side of the tray[s]

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use two trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are crispy and the sausages are cooked through


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon and discard

Dice half the deseeded cucumber very finely (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]


### Step 4

Combine the diced cucumber, chopped shallot and cider vinegar with your sweet pepper relish, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar, your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt in a small bowl

Set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber relish


### Step 5

Slice the remaining deseeded cucumber finely


### Step 6

Once the sausages and chips have had 20 min, put your bread roll[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and crusty

Once done, carefully slice in half


### Step 7

Drain the quick-pickled cucumber relish

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Fill the warmed bread roll with the meat-free sausages, mustard ketchup and quick-pickled cucumber relish, then top with your crispy onions

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Top the salad with the sliced cucumber and drizzle with some olive oil

Enjoy!
