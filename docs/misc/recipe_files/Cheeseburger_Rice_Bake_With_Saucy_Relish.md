## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(you'll use the rest later!)

Roughly chop half your tomato[es] (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion, beef mince, ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the beef mince is starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once slightly browned, add the chopped tomato and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the tomato has softened – this is your spiced beef


### Step 3

Transfer the spiced beef to an oven-proof dish

Add your chicken stock mix, white long grain rice and a pinch of salt with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cover tightly with tin foil, and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice and beef are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dice your cucumber

Dice the remaining red onion finely

Add the diced cucumber and diced red onion to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled onion & cucumber


### Step 5

Grate your cheddar cheese

Dice the remaining tomato

Combine your mustard ketchup, mayo and tomato ketchup in a small bowl – this is your sauce


### Step 6

Once the rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and discard the foil

Top the cooked rice with the grated cheese and return it to the oven for a further 5 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your 'cheeseburger' rice bake


### Step 7

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> pickling liquid from the quick pickled onion & cucumber to the sauce, discard the remaining liquid

Mix everything together – this is your burger sauce

Combine the diced tomato with the drained quick pickled onion & cucumber – this is your tomato relish

### Step 8

Serve the 'cheeseburger' rice bake with some of the burger sauce drizzled all over

Top with the tomato relish

Combine the remaining burger sauce with any remaining tomato relish and serve to the side – this is your saucy relish

Enjoy!
