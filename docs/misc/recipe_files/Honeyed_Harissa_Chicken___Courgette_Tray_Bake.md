### Step 3

Combine the harissa paste and honey in a bowl and stir to combine – this is your honey harissa marinade

Coat the chicken thighs in half the marinade and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min

### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

While the chicken is in the oven, drain and rinse the chickpeas

Combine the drained chickpeas, chopped garlic and ras el hanout in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up until the chickpeas are fully coated – these are your spiced chickpeas

### Step 5

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Combine most of the chopped mint (save some for garnish!) and natural yoghurt in a bowl with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper – this is your mint yoghurt

### Step 7

Meanwhile, cut the plain naans in half on the diagonal

Add the naan halves to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil then sprinkle the ground paprika over the top

Then with your hands (or the back of a spoon) rub the spice all over so the top is fully coated in paprika

Put the paprika-spiced bread into the oven for the final 5 min until warmed through and a little crispy

### Step 8

Serve the honeyed harissa chicken and roasted vegetables with the mint yoghurt dolloped over the top and the paprika-spiced bread to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped mint

Enjoy!
