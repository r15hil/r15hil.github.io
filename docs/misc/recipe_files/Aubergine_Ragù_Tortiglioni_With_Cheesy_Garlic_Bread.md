### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk on, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern and add the aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the flesh has softened

### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks 

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Add the chopped parsley, half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your cheesy garlic mixture

### Step 3

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water and return to the pot

### Step 4

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften and caramelise

### Step 5

Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened aubergine flesh out of the skins with a spoon, pulling it apart as you go – this is your pulled aubergine

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily, then discard the skins and reserve the tray[s]!

Once the onion has started to soften, add the pulled aubergine, remaining chopped garlic, your ground smoked paprika and soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2 min until fragrant

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1684229774712-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, Henderson's Relish and a pinch of sugar and stir for 30 secs

Add your vegetable stock mix with a splash of starchy pasta water and cook for 4-5 min until the sauce has the consistency of bolognese – this is your aubergine ragù

Tip: Add another splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1684229781817-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the ragù is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] into 3 slices per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>and add the slices to the reserved baking tray[s]

Top each ciabatta slice with a spoonful of the cheesy garlic mixture and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until all the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy garlic bread

Stir the tortiglioni through the aubergine ragù – this is your aubergine ragù tortiglioni

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine ragù tortiglioni with the cheesy garlic bread to the side

Tear over your basil leaves and top with the reserved grated cheese

Enjoy!
