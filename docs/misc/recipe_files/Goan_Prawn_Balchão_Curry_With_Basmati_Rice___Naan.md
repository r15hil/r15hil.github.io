## Description

This dry-style curry draws influence from the region's 450-year Portuguese colonial rule. Balchão refers to the use of vinegar as a way of preserving fish and meat, and it's what gives this curry its mouthwatering hot and sour flavour. Serve over basmati rice with a warm naan to the side.
