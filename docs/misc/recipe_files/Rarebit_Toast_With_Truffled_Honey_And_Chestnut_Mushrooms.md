### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until browned

Once browned, transfer the cooked mushrooms to a plate (reserve the pan!)

### Step 3

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a baking tray, cut-side down, with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray under the grill for 4-5 min or until toasted and golden

Once toasted, turn the ciabatta halves over and return them to the grill for 2 min further or until lightly toasted, then remove from the grill and set aside

### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your cornflour and grated cheese to a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your cornfloured cheese

### Step 5

Mix your honey and truffle oil in a bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your truffled honey

Chop your tomatoes roughly

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Set the washed salad and chopped tomatoes aside until serving

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat with the cornfloured cheese, soft cheese and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk

Cook for 3 min or until melted and thickened

Once thickened, add your wholegrain mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!), Henderson's Relish and a pinch of salt and pepper, then remove the pan from the heat – this is your rarebit sauce

### Step 7

Once the ciabatta halves are lightly toasted, spoon the rarebit sauce all over them

Tip: Make sure to spread the sauce to the edges of the ciabatta to stop the corners burning!

Add the cooked mushrooms to the baking tray

Return the tray to the grill and cook for 3-4 min or until the rarebit sauce is lightly browned – these are your rarebit toasts

### Step 8

Serve the rarebit toasts with the chopped tomatoes and salad to the side

Top the toasts with the cooked mushrooms and truffled honey

Enjoy!
