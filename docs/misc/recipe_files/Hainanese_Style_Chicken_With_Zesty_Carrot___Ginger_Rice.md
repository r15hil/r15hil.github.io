## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) half your ginger


### Step 2

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add to an oven-proof dish with the grated carrot, chopped ginger, chicken stock mix and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up, cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your zesty carrot & ginger rice

Once cooked, remove from the oven and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, trim, then roughly chop 1/3 of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>spring onion[s]

Roughly chop the remaining ginger


### Step 4

Add the chicken breast portions to a medium sized pot (with a matching lid) with the chopped spring onion and remaining chopped ginger

Add 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil, with the lid on, over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 min (turning the chicken half way) or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), then drain – this is your Hainanese-style chicken


### Step 5

Slice your cucumber into discs

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half, then slice finely


### Step 6

Trim, then slice the remaining spring onions

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the lime[s] in half


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, sliced spring onion, chopped garlic and chopped coriander with the juice of half the lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your fragrant lime dressing

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Slice the Hainanese-style chicken and serve it over the sliced tomato and cucumber discs with the zesty carrot & ginger rice to the side

Drizzle the fragrant lime dressing over the chicken, then garnish with a lime wedge and your crispy onions

Enjoy!
