## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 30ml mayonnaise
- 0 jumbo king prawns
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 6 bao buns
- 8ml Sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 160g carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix
- 212g jumbo king prawns
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 3 white potatoes
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 25g honey
- 5g coriander
- 1 garlic clove
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your mooli slaw mix and rice vinegar to a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled mooli slaw


### Step 3

Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Pick your coriander leaves from the stalks, discard the stalks


### Step 4

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine the grated garlic, five-spice mix, hoisin sauce, honey and soy sauce in a bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and stir everything together – this is your char siu-style sauce


### Step 5

Once the fries are nearly done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain, then add your jumbo prawns to a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and mix together until the prawns are fully coated

Once hot, add the coated jumbo prawns to the pan and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until golden


### Step 6

Once the prawns are golden, add the char siu-style sauce to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened and the prawns are cooked through – these are your char siu-style jumbo prawns


### Step 7

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the char siu-style jumbo prawns and top with some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo and garnish with half of the crispy onions and coriander leaves (save the rest for later!) – these are your char siu-style jumbo prawn bao buns

### Step 8

Serve the char siu-style jumbo prawn bao buns with the fries and remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw to the side

Load up the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo, crispy onions and coriander leaves

Enjoy!
