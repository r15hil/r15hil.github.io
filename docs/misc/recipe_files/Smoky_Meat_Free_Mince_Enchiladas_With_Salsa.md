Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 3

While the onions are cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!), ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 4-6 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 5

Increase the heat to high, add the tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your smoky meat-free mince filling

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little olive oil

### Step 6

Once thickened, divide the smoky meat-free mince filling between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and arrange them into the greased oven-proof dish

Top with the grated cheese and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until the tortillas are beginning to crisp and the cheese has melted – these are your smoky meat-free mince enchiladas

### Step 7

While the enchiladas are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then stir it all together – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 8

Serve the smoky meat-free mince enchiladas topped with the tomato salsa

Enjoy!
