### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips, then add them to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle over half the dried sage (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Trim the Brussels sprouts and chop them in half, then add them to a food processor and blitz for 30 secs or until finely shredded

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Slice them finely instead!

Add the shredded sprouts to a colander and pour boiled water all over them until bright green and wilted, then set aside to steam dry

### Step 3

Slice the baby button mushrooms finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms with the smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened – these are your 'bacon' mushrooms

### Step 4

Add the 'bacon' mushrooms, wilted sprouts, mayo and mustard ketchup to a large bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your sprout slaw

### Step 5

Reboil a kettle

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Add the ultimate vegan burger patties to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Whilst the patties are cooking, the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2320.-step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil to a pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs until a sandy paste has formed

Add the vegetable stock with the Marmite and remaining dried sage and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally, until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your gravy

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2320.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the patties are cooked, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice – these are your cheesy vegan patties

Add the brioche buns to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through

Cut the warmed brioche buns in half

### Step 8

Fill each brioche bun with a cheesy vegan patty and a spoonful of sprout slaw

Serve any remaining slaw to the side with the chunky chips and gravy for dipping

Enjoy!
