## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion is starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water

Add your fish sauce and a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and ground paprika to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your red Thai curry paste and halved green beans to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the green beans are slightly tender

Chop your cod fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Once the green beans are slightly tender, add the coconut stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your Thai red curry

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and top the Thai red curry with your chopped cod and a pinch of salt

Cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Thai red cod curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Thai red cod curry over the cooked rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
