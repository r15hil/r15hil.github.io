### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layers of the lemongrass and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core[s] finely

### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice, outer lemongrass layers and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving - this is your lemongrass rice

### Step 3

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the remaining

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 4

Add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), lime zest, chopped lemongrass, crushed garlic and the chopped ginger to a pestle & mortar

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and grind to a paste – this is your tom yum paste

Tip: Don’t have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!

Slice your baby button mushrooms finely

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your tom yum paste, cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1714736013830-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the tomato wedges and sliced mushrooms

Add the chopped creamed coconut to the pan with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>boiled water, your fish sauce, lime leaf[ves] and vegetable stock mix

Add a squeeze of lime juice and give everything a good mix up

Drain and add your king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your creamy king prawn tom yum

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the creamy king prawn tom yum with the lemongrass rice

Garnish with a lime wedge and the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
