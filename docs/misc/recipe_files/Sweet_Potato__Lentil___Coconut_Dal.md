### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) your ginger

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half of the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato and the remaining sliced onion to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until tender and golden (keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn!) – this is your roasted sweet potato & onion

### Step 4

While the sweet potato is roasting, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and creamed coconut in 450ml <span class="text-purple">[585ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[765ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1457.-step-5-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the rinsed red lentils and your green lentils (no need to drain!) to the pan

Add the coconut stock and cook, stirring frequently, for 15-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the lentils are tender

### Step 7

While the lentils are cooking, pick your coriander leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Once the lentils are cooked, stir through half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and add a squeeze of lemon juice – this is your coconut dal

Tip: Add more boiled water to loosen the dal if it's looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Top the coconut dal with the roasted sweet potato & onion

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander, your nigella seeds and a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
