## Description

Japanese flavours are often deep, salty, sweet and hot but always balanced. This dish elevates aubergine to the next level. Once scored, its spongy surface absorbs the miso marinade and turns it into a glaze when baked.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp toasted sesame oil 
- 10g fresh coriander
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 1/2 tsp fiery chilli flakes
- 1 spring onion
- 1 tbsp white rice vinegar 
- 2 soy sauce sachets (16ml)
- 1 aubergine 
- 1 red pepper
- 2 tbsp white miso paste
- 3 wheat noodle nests 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C /200°C (fan)/425°F/Gas 7 


Boil a kettle


Cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways 


Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin


### Step 2

Combine the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), miso paste, honey, soy sauce and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water until smooth - this is your miso dressing


### Step 3

Add the aubergine halves to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Spoon 1 tbsp of miso dressing over each aubergine half, cut-side up (you'll use the rest later)


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the aubergines are tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the peppers and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and slightly charred


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the wheat noodles to a pot of boiling water and cook for 4-6 min or until tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and add the noodles to the pan with the charred peppers, stir and remove from the heat


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the remaining miso dressing with the sesame oil and rice vinegar - stir to combine


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks 


Trim and chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 7

Add the spring onion, most of the coriander (reserve some for garnish) and most of the miso dressing to the noodles and stir to combine

### Step 8

Serve the miso-glazed aubergine over the noodles 


Drizzle the remaining miso dressing over 


Garnish with the remaining coriander 


Enjoy!
