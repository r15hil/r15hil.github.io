## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Chop your chicken breast strips<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the diced onion, your curry powder and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 2 min or until the onion is starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim, then cut your green beans in half


### Step 4

Add the chopped chicken to the pan and cook for 2 min

Stir in your chicken stock mix and add your tomato paste

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if the pan looks a little dry


### Step 5

Cook for 2 min further or until the chicken is starting to brown

Once brown, add your basmati rice to the pan and stir to coat the grains in the spice and oil


### Step 6

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the halved green beans and your sultanas


### Step 7

Give everything a good mix, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice is not cooked or the mixture is a little dry

### Step 8

Once done, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your chicken biryani

Serve the chicken biryani with a dollop of your natural yoghurt over the top

Enjoy!
