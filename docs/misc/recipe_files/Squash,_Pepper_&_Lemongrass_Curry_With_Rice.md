### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and golden

### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Boil a kettle

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a big pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 5 min, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 4

Meanwhile, place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and your garlic, then finely chop (or grate) both

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut it down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (save for later!) and chop the soft inner core[s] finely

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1632300795931-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[450ml]</span> cold water and the outer lemongrass layers and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1632300801589-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped lemongrass core, curry powder and nigella seeds to the pan with the onion and cook for 2 min

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1632300806820-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[400ml] </span>boiled water, the softened creamed coconut and the vegetable stock mix to the pan along with your mangetout

Mix well and cook, covered for a further 5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the mangetout are tender

Once thickened, add the roasted butternut squash cubes to the pan – this is your squash, pepper & lemongrass curry

### Step 8

Stir half of the chopped coriander through the squash, pepper & lemongrass curry and serve over the lemongrass rice (discard the outer lemongrass layers!)

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
