### Step 7

Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish and top with the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sausage & pepper chilli con carne pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve the sausage & pepper chilli con carne pasta bake with the chopped coriander and reserved diced onion sprinkled over the top

Season with a grind of black pepper
