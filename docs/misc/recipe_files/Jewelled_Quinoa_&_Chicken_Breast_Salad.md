### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water, then add it to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml [500ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender, then remove from the heat

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken breast portions and cook on each side for 3 min

### Step 5

Add the blanched almonds to a separate tray, drizzle them with a little olive oil and place them in the oven for 5 min or until slightly darkened in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, remove from the oven and sprinkle with salt

Leave them to cool on the tray

Drain the soaked cranberries

Finely slice the cooked chicken breast portions
