Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with vegetable oil and add your ground coriander and cumin seeds

Season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the sweet potato is tender

Chop your cherry tomatoes<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Once the sweet potato is tender, divide them between your tortillas, covering only half, and crush down gently with the back of a spoon (this will help the tortillas stick together)

Crumble your Greek cheese over the crushed sweet potato and add the sliced spring onion

Roll the tortillas tightly to form a cigar shape – these are your sweet potato & Greek cheese taquitos
