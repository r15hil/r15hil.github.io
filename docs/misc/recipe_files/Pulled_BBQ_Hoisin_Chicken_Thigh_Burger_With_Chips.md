## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> boiled water, then add your tomato paste, tomato ketchup, hoisin sauce, Dijon mustard, Henderson's Relish, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your BBQ hoisin sauce


### Step 2

Add your chicken thighs to an oven-proof dish and cover them with the BBQ hoisin sauce

Put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and cider vinegar with a generous pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your creamy dressing


### Step 5

Wash, then cut your lettuce into quarters, lengthways and pat dry with kitchen paper

Use the remaining time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

Once everything's done, remove the BBQ hoisin chicken thigh from the oven

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the sliced brioche to a baking tray, cut-side down and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Transfer the cooked chicken thigh from the dish to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as pulling

Return the pulled chicken thigh to the dish and give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled BBQ hoisin chicken thigh

### Step 8

To build, fill the warmed brioche bun with the pulled BBQ hoisin chicken thigh and a drizzle of the creamy dressing (save the rest for the salad!) – this is your pulled BBQ hoisin chicken thigh burger

Serve with the lettuce wedges and chips to the side

Drizzle the remaining creamy dressing over the lettuce

Enjoy!
