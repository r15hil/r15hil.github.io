### Step 1

Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready


Skim through these steps


Wash your fruit and veg


Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!


Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the medium egg noodles to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water


### Step 4

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Cut the sugar snap peas in half


### Step 5

Add the sliced sugar snap peas to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 6

Add the black bean sauce to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce has warmed through and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 7

Once the noodles are done, stir them through the black bean sauce – this is your chicken &amp; black bean noodle stir fry


Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the chicken &amp; black bean noodle stir fry in bowls


Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and sliced spring onion


Enjoy!
