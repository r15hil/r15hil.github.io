## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough chunks

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 5

Reduce the heat to medium

Add the chopped onion and chopped pepper to the dish with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour, the crushed garlic, black beans, your ground smoked paprika, bay leaf[ves] and ground cumin and give everything a good mix up

Add 700ml <span class="text-purple">[820ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water, your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and red wine paste and stir it all together


### Step 6

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 50 min or until the sauce is thickened and rich – this is your Cuban-style Fable mushroom & pepper stew

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the stew has been cooking for 30 min, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 8

To serve, tear your coriander and sprinkle all over the Cuban-style Fable mushroom & pepper stew

Serve with the cooked rice to the side

Dig in!
