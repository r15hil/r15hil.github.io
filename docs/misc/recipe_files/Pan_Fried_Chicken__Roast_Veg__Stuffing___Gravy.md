## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s], then top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] into small bite-sized pieces

Dice your potatoes (skins on), then crush 3/4 of your garlic cloves with the side of your knife (keeping the skins on)


### Step 2

Add the chopped carrot, parsnip, potato and crushed garlic to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the vegetables are tender and browned

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your remaining garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped shallot and garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until the shallot has softened, then add your dried sage and cook for a further 30 sec – this is your sage & onion butter


### Step 4

Dissolve half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [220ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Combine the chicken stock, panko breadcrumbs and the sage & onion butter in a bowl and set aside to cool and absorb the liquid

Meanwhile, place your hand flat onto your chicken breast portion[s]

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces


### Step 5

Return the pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4 min on each side or until browned on both sides

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to the baking tray with the vegetables for the last 10-12 min of cooking time


### Step 6

Reboil a kettle

Meanwhile, divide the sage & onion stuffing into 2 per person and shape into stuffing balls

Add the stuffing balls to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 10-12 min or until they're browned


### Step 7

Meanwhile, reduce the pan to a medium heat, then dissolve your remaining chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir for 30 secs

Stir in the chicken stock and Henderson's Relish and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the gravy has thickened

Once cooked, remove the chicken and slice finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken and gravy with the roast vegetables and sage & onion stuffing balls

Enjoy!
