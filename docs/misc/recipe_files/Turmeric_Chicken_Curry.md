### Step 1

Add the rice and 350ml [700ml] water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 3

Split open the cardamom pods, removing the black inner seeds

Grind them slightly in a pestle and mortar, and heat a dry pan over a medium-low heat

Once warm, add the cardamom seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and turmeric

Toast the spices for 30 seconds, then add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the pan

Add in the chicken stock mix, ground almonds and half [all] of the honey (you'll use the rest later)
