### Step 3

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted boiled water to the boil over a high heat


Add the linguine and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through but with a slight bite


Once&nbsp;cooked, reserve approx.&nbsp;175ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span>&nbsp;starchy pasta water, then drain and return the pasta to the pot

### Step 5

Meanwhile,&nbsp;stir the brown sauce and&nbsp;tomato paste into the reserved starchy pasta water with a large pinch of both&nbsp;salt and sugar


Stir to dissolve &ndash; this is your stock


Tip: pasta water is full of starch which helps your sauce stick to the linguine

### Step 6

Stir the stock into the beef, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce has a rag&ugrave;-like consistency (approx. 3-6 min)


Once done, stir in the drained linguine


Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper if needed
