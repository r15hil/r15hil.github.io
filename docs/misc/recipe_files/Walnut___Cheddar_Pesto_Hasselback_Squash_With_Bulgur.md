### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel the butternut squash<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and cut in half using a sharp knife

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard

### Step 2

Cut narrow slices (about 1cm in width) into the butternut squash halves, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base

Transfer the butternut squash halves to a baking tray and drizzle generously with olive oil and a big pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 40-45 min or until the butternut squash is soft – this is your hasselback butternut squash

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the walnuts and toast for 3-4 min, or until they've darkened in colour slightly

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the basil coarsely (including the stalks)

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Crumble the cheddar into small pieces

Transfer the toasted walnuts to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop the walnuts with a knife, then add to a pestle & mortar!

### Step 6

Add the chopped basil, chopped garlic and crumbled cheddar to the food processor with the toasted walnuts (or a pestle & mortar)

Add the red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper, and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz together to form a coarse purée – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto

### Step 7

Cut the cherry tomatoes in half

Fluff the cooked bulgur then stir through the halved cherry tomatoes and half of the walnut & cheddar pesto (reserve the rest for garnish!) – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto bulgur

Wash the rocket, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the hasselback butternut squash over the walnut & cheddar pesto bulgur and rocket

Dot the remaining walnut & cheddar pesto all over

Enjoy!
