### Step 2

Add the beef mince, chopped ginger, coriander stems, fish sauce and half the red curry paste in a mixing bowl


Mix thoroughly until everything is fully combined (use clean hands!)


Divide the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and shape into balls

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the Thai rice noodles to a pot of salted boiled water (enough to cover them) on a high heat


Boil for 4-6 min, or until they're cooked through but with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and rinse them briefly under cold water, shaking off the excess water before returning them to the pot

Combine the toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, lime juice and remaining red curry paste and mix together thoroughly - this is your Thai dressing

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely&nbsp;

Tip: use tongs to turn them regularly for even cooking

### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the&nbsp;drained Thai rice noodles to a medium heat&nbsp;


Add the Thai dressing and cook the noodles for 1 min or until they've warmed through


Once warmed, remove them from the heat and stir in the chopped spring onion, coriander leaves and roasted peanuts


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the cooked meatballs over the Thai noodles with any remaining pan juice spooned over&nbsp;


Enjoy!
