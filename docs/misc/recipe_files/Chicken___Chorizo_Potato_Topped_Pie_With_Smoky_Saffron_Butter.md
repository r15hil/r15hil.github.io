### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, add them to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once fork-tender, drain and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then crush the seasoned potatoes lightly with a fork – these are your crushed potatoes

### Step 2

Trim your green beans

### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until golden

### Step 5

Once golden, add the diced onion and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add half your ground smoked paprika and 2/3 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1715959348918-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the creamy stock with a grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & chorizo pie filling

Transfer the chicken & chorizo pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the crushed potatoes (reserve the pot!)

Put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden – this is your chicken & chorizo potato-topped pie

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1715959352878-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add the green beans to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them), then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Add the remaining chopped garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter to a bowl and put in the microwave for 30 secs or until melted

Once melted, combine with the remaining ground smoked paprika and your saffron – this is your smoky saffron butter

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & chorizo potato-topped pie with the green beans to the side

Drizzle over the smoky saffron butter and garnish with the chopped parsley
