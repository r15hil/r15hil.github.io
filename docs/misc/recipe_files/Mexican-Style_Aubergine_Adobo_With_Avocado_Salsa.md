### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and discard the stem[s]

### Step 2

Heat a medium-sized pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, crushed garlic and chilli halves (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot

Cook for 6-7 min or until the vegetables are starting to brown

### Step 3

Meanwhile, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop lengthways into wedges

Add the aubergine wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and golden

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 4

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 5

Once the veg has browned, add your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped tomatoes, dried oregano, ground cumin, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and vegetable stock to the pot and cook for 5 min further or until the onion has softened

Once softened, remove the pot from the heat and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Return the pot to a medium-high heat and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce begins to thicken – this is your Mexican-style adobo sauce

### Step 6

Chop your tomato[es] finely, then chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1680015719051-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine the diced avocado, chopped tomato and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) in a bowl

Add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up – this is your avocado salsa

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the Mexican-style adobo sauce with the roasted aubergine wedges on top and the cooked rice and avocado salsa to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
