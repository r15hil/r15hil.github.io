## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into quarters, then finely slice 1/4 of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>onion quarter[s] and set aside for serving


### Step 3

Chop your ginger in half

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Slice your lemongrass in half lengthways


### Step 4

Add the onion quarters to the dish with the halved lemongrass, crushed garlic and ginger halves


### Step 5

Add your red Thai curry paste and your chicken stock mix

Add 600ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> [1.2L] </span>boiled water with your creamed coconut and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 6

Add your diced chicken breast and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min

Meanwhile, trim your green beans, then chop them into thirds and set aside for later

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped green beans and medium egg noodles

Tip: Nestle the noodles into the sauce for even cooking!

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the noodles are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one-pot Thai red chicken breast noodle soup

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

### Step 8

To serve, top the one-pot Thai red chicken breast noodle soup with the sliced onion and chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Tip: Watch out for the ginger halves and discard them!

Tear over your coriander leaves

Dig in!
