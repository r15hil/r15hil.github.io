## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a dry pan (preferably non-stick) on a high heat


Once hot, add the gammon joint<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> &amp; cook until browned on all sides (approx. 5 min total time)


Tip: Trim off any fat for a leaner meal


### Step 2

Meanwhile, line a baking tray with tin foil


Transfer the seared gammon to the centre of the lined tray (reserve the pan for step 5)


Season with plenty of pepper and place in the oven for an initial 15 min until the gammon is releasing its juices


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (with skin) into equal 3cm chunks


Peel and cut the carrots into 3cm chunks, discarding the root ends


Add the potatoes, carrots and salt (optional) to a pot, cover with cold water by 4cm and place over a high heat to boil


### Step 4

Once the gammon has had the initial 15 min, flip the gammon and lay the pineapple rings around (discard the juice)


Return the tray of gammon and pineapple to the oven for an additional 20-25 min, or until the gammon is hot throughout


Once the potato and carrot pot is boiling, cook for 5-7 min


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Return the gammon pan to a medium heat and melt 30g <span class="text-danger">(60g)</span> of butter


Once melted, stir in 30g <span class="text-danger">(60g)</span> of flour and the chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min - this is your roux


### Step 6

Whisk in 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> of milk gradually and throw in the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">(ves)</span>


Cook for 5 min, stirring constantly, or until a smooth, thick sauce remains


Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely (including the stalks)


### Step 7

Once the vegetables are tender, drain and cover


Once the sauce has thickened, add the parsley, remove from the heat and lightly season with pepper

### Step 8

Rest the cooked gammon for 3-4 min


Slice the gammon thinly and serve with the pineapple rings over the top with the vegetables and parsely sauce to the side


Enjoy!
