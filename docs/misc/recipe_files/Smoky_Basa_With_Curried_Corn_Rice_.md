### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low, cover and cook for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Meanwhile,&nbsp;add the smoked basa to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Place the fish under the grill for 7-10 min or until cooked through


Tip: the fish is cooked when it puffs up slightly, turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the rice has cooked, remove it from the heat


Tip: add a splash or two of water if it looks too dry


Add a large knob of butter and season very generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Stir the chopped coriander through - this is your buttered corn rice
