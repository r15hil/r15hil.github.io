## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Melt a knob of butter in a pot with a lid over a medium heat

Once melted, add the crushed cardamom pods and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice and cook for 1 min further, then add 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add your garam masala, ground cumin, vegetable stock mix, chopped garlic and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min


### Step 5

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Add the chopped tomato[es], tomato paste, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook over a medium heat for 4 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency

Once thickened, add your spinach and cook for a further 5-6 min or until it's wilted


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

Heat a second large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped paneer and cook for 3-5 min, turning occasionally until it's golden on all sides


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the golden paneer to the curry sauce and give everything a good mix up

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through your natural yoghurt – this is your spinach & paneer curry

### Step 8

Serve the spinach & paneer curry over the cardamom rice, discard the cardamom pods

Enjoy!
