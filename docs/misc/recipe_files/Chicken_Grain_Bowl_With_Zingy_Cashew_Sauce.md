## Ingredients

- 0 British chicken breast portion
- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 0 bulgur wheat
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 160g blanched peas
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 80g spinach
- 10g coriander & mint
- 25g cashew nuts
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Add your cashew nuts to a small bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soften


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop half of your garlic clove[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(save the other half for later!)

Cut your lime[s] in half


### Step 3

Season your chicken breast portion[s] on both sides with salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat


### Step 4

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped garlic and a couple of splashes of water to the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, add your bulgur wheat, chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to medium then cook, covered, for 7-9 min or until almost all the water has absorbed

Once done, remove the pot from the heat, fluff with a fork and set aside until later


### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain the soaked cashews and add them to a food processor with most of the mint leaves (save a few for garnish!), coriander, the juice of the lime[s],<span class="text-danger"> </span>a handful of spinach (you'll use the rest later!) and the remaining garlic

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> cold water, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your zingy cashew sauce


### Step 7

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Stir the refreshed peas, remaining spinach and half of the zingy cashew sauce (save the rest for later!) through the cooked bulgur – this is your spinach & pea bulgur

Slice the cooked chicken on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken over the spinach & pea bulgur

Drizzle over the remaining zingy cashew sauce

Season with a grind of black pepper

Garnish with the remaining mint leaves

Enjoy!
