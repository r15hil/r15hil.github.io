### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Carefully chop the sweetcorn cobettes into thirds with a sharp knife, so you end up with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> rounds

Chop the waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the sweetcorn rounds and chopped potatoes to the pan with half the oregano, half the cumin, half the paprika and half the ground coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potatoes have begun to soften – this is your Cajun-style boil

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the beef mince to a bowl with the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining oregano, cumin, paprika and ground coriander

Season with a generous pinch of salt, then using clean hands give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Roll the burger mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>meatballs and press down with your hands to form patties – these are your Cajun-style beef patties

### Step 4

Wash the gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then pat dry with kitchen paper and remove 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> leaves and set aside, then chop the core into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges

Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) then roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Once softened, add the Cajun-style boil to a baking tray with any remaining liquid (reserve the pan) and put in the oven for 20-25 min or until lightly browned – this is your tray baked Cajun-style boil

Meanwhile, combine the lime zest with half the mayo (you'll use the rest later!), the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a small drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and whisk everything together – this is your zesty lime mayo

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1650385155939-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the Cajun-style beef patties to one side of a separate baking tray lined with baking paper (or tin foil)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Slice the brioche buns in half and once the patties have 3 min left add the brioche halves to the other side of the baking tray, cut side up, until warmed through and toasted

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1650385159614-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Drain the king prawns

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil, once hot, add the drained king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Once cooked, stir through half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) with the juice of the remaining lime – these are your coriander prawns

### Step 8

Spread each toasted brioche base with the zesty lime mayo, then top with the coriander prawns, a lettuce leaf, Cajun-style beef patty and a toasted brioche lid – this is your surf 'n' turf beef burger

Serve the surf 'n' turf beef burger with the tray baked Cajun-style boil and gem wedges to the side, dollop the remaining mayo all over and sprinkle over the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
