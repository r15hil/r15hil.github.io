Finely slice the remaining red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the chestnut mushrooms into quarters

Drain and rinse the black beans

### Step 3

Heat a medium sized pot with a lid over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and half the chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, add the ground smoked paprika, drained black beans, soy sauce and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the beans are very soft

### Step 4

Brush the tortillas with a little olive oil on each side and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the tortillas to a baking tray and place a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tortillas are golden and crisp – these are crispy tortillas

### Step 5

Heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 5-6 min or until tender – these are you smoky mushrooms

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly

Add the diced avocado to a large bowl with half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!), the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your avocado salsa

### Step 7

Once the black beans have softened, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash them to a coarse paste – these are your refried beans

Combine the remaining chopped garlic and yoghurt in a small bowl – this is your garlic yoghurt

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

To build your tostadas, top the crispy tortillas with the refried beans, smoky mushrooms, avocado salsa, quick-pickled red onion and garlic yoghurt

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
