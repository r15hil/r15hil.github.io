## Description

Blue cheese dressing is an American classic. Salty, tangy and creamy at once - it's bound to transform any salad. We've topped crisp little gem lettuce with sliced chicken, candied pecans, baby plum tomatoes and toasty oregano croutons (and smothered the lot in a mild blue cheese dressing of course) Say cheeeese!
