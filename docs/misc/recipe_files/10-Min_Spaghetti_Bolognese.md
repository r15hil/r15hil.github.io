### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over the highest heat

Trim, then chop the spring onions roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed!)

### Step 3

Once hot, add the beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

Add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the quick cook spaghetti for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the quick cook spaghetti and return it to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil

Tear the chestnut mushrooms into the pan

Add the chopped spring onion, roasted garlic paste and dried oregano and give everything a good mix up

### Step 6

Add the tomato frito with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> water and the soy sauce and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef bolognese

### Step 7

While the beef mince is cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

Top the beef bolognese with the grated cheddar, tear the basil leaves over, season with a grind of pepper and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
