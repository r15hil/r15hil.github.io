### Step 6

Slightly scrunch the edges of the paper around the filling and then add the Thai-style curry stock evenly between each parcel

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper around the fish to form a sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17 min or until the fish is cooked through and the veg has softened – this is your Thai-style hake & veg

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style hake & veg with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Enjoy!
