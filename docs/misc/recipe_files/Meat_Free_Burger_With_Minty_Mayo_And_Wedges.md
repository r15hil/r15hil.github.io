## Ingredients

- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Mint sauce (20g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Ciabatta x2
- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Rice vinegar (15ml) x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Rice vinegar (30ml)
- Tomato
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season generously with salt, then put them in the oven for 30-40 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your vegan burger patty[ies] to a bowl with the chopped garlic, Henderson's Relish and a large pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up

Divide the mixture shape into 1 thin patty per person and refrigerate


### Step 3

Peel your cucumber, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Squeeze out the excess liquid from the cucumber ribbons (over the sink is the easiest place) and place them in a bowl

Tip: You want to get rid of the excess liquid so that the cucumber absorbs the pickling vinegar


### Step 4

Add your rice vinegar to a small pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, remove from the heat and combine the vinegar mix and cucumber ribbons in a bowl

Set them aside to pickle until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 5

Place your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min to warm through


### Step 6

Combine your mayo and mint sauce in a small mixing bowl with a large drizzle of olive oil – this is your minty mayo

Slice your tomato[es]


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the refrigerated patty[ies] and cook for 5 min on each side or until cooked through and nicely charred

Carefully cut the warmed ciabatta in half

### Step 8

To assemble, layer your ciabatta base with a pile of quick-pickled cucumber, a patty, sliced tomato and a generous dollop of minty mayo topped with the ciabatta lid – this is your meat-free burger

Serve the meat-free burger with the wedges and any remaining minty mayo to the side

Enjoy!
