### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes

Crush your garlic (skins on) with the side of a knife

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the butter has melted, add the crushed garlic and cubed potatoes to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise

### Step 3

Once the potatoes have caramelised, add them to a tray (save the pan for later!) and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your parmentier potatoes

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need 2 trays!

### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and dice your shallot[s] as finely as you can

Chop your capers roughly

Add the chopped shallot and capers to a bowl with your clotted cream, Dijon mustard and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your bistro butter

### Step 5

Add your flat white mushroom[s] to a separate baking tray and top with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10-15 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, halve your cherry tomatoes

### Step 6

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, rub with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add your steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

### Step 7

Once the mushroom has started to soften, add the halved cherry tomatoes (cut side up) to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the tomatoes have warmed through

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the rested steak with the parmentier potatoes, roasted mushroom, cherry tomatoes and salad to the side

Spoon the bistro butter over the steak

Enjoy!
