## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


### Step 3

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Discard the outer green pod[s] and add the cardamom seeds to a pestle & mortar with your yellow mustard seeds and a pinch of salt and roughly bash until you end up with a coarse powder – this is your spice mix

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and chopped green beans with your ground turmeric, curry powder and spice mix and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix and gluten free soy sauce with your tomato paste and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 5

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium high and add the drained chickpeas

Remove your pineapple from the can (save the juice!) and chop roughly into bite-sized pieces

Add the reserved pineapple juice to the pan


### Step 6

Add the chopped pineapple and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your Sri Lankan-style pineapple & chickpea curry


### Step 7

While the curry is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style pineapple & chickpea curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!
