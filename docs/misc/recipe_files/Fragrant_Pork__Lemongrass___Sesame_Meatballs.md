### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ 475°F/ Gas 9


Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut it<span class="text-danger"> [them]</span> down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly


Peel and roughly chop the garlic


Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop

### Step 2

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, de-seed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly


Combine the chopped lemongrass innards, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped chilli <span class="text-highlight">(can't</span> handle the heat? Go easy!) and chop everything together until you are left with a finely chopped mixture – this is your aromatic mix

### Step 3

Add the pork mince to a bowl with the panko breadcrumbs, half of the soy sauce and the aromatic mix and give everything a good mix up 


Divide the pork mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and shape into meatballs


Spread the toasted sesame seeds over a large board and roll the meatballs into the seeds to lightly coat them – these are your pork &amp; sesame meatballs

### Step 4

Add the outer lemongrass layers to a pot (with a lid) with the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat 


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

<span class="text-highlight">While the rice is cooking, heat</span> a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat 


Once hot, add the pork &amp; sesame meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, or until they're browned all over

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut the broccoli into quarters, lengthways, then cut each quarter again, so you end up with 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span><span class="text-danger"> </span>broccoli wedges


Add the broccoli wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt 


Transfer the browned meatballs (keep the pan!) to the tray with the broccoli and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until the broccoli is crispy<span class="text-highlight"> – this is your charred broccoli </span>

### Step 7

<span class="text-highlight">While the meatballs are cooking, combine</span> the honey with the remaining soy sauce – this is your honey-soy dressing 


Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium heat 


Once hot, add the honey-soy dressing and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Once cooked, remove the lemongrass from the rice and fluff it with a fork 


Serve the pork &amp; sesame meatballs over <span class="text-highlight">the basmati rice </span>with the charred broccoli to the side


Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Drizzle the warm honey-soy dressing over and enjoy!
