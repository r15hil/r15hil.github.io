## Ingredients

- Cornflour (4tbsp)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Brioche style buns (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Tomato
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crispy


### Step 2

While the fries are in the oven, cut your chicken breast portion[s] into strips

Add the chicken strips, soy sauce and ground smoked paprika to a bowl and give everything a good mix up then set aside

Add your cornflour and dried oregano to a shallow plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix well – this is your herby flour mix


### Step 3

Remove the chicken strips from the bowl and firmly press each one into the herby flour mix, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – these are your coated chicken strips


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken strips and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy fried chicken


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Dice your tomato[es] finely


### Step 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic with your mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic mayo

Tip: Don't like raw garlic? Go easy!

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing

### Step 8

Spread the warmed brioche base with the garlic mayo, then pile up the shredded lettuce and crispy fried chicken, topping with the warmed brioche lid

Serve the fries, diced tomato and remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the salad dressing over the tomato and lettuce

Enjoy!
