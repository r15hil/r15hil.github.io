## Ingredients

- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Red onion
- Beef stock mix (11g)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Garlic clove
- British beef mince (250g)
- Farfalle (200g)
- Farfalle (100g) x0

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and grate half your red onion[s] (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 2

Add your beef mince, grated onion and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!), divide the beef mixture and shape into 3 meatballs per person


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside (reserve the pan!), these will finish cooking in the sauce later


### Step 4

Peel and finely slice the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 6

Once the onion has started to soften, add your chopped tomatoes and beef stock mix to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

Return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tomato sauce & beef meatballs


### Step 7

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle

### Step 8

Serve the farfalle topped with the tomato sauce & beef meatballs

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
