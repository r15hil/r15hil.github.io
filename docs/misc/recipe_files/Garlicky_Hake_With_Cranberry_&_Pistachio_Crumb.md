### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop finely

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped rosemary, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden brown and crispy – these are your crispy rosemary potatoes

### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] into batons

### Step 3

Add the carrot batons and chopped thyme to a tin foil-lined tray with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest for later!) and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a small pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your soy sauce, Hendersons' Relish and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock

### Step 4

Heat a pot with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter over a medium heat and cook for 1 min or until melted

Once melted, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until a sandy paste remains

Gradually whisk in the stock and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your gravy

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your hake fillet[s] with your ground sumac, remaining garlic and a grind of pepper and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your garlicky hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Chop your cranberries and pistachios roughly

Once the carrot batons have softened, transfer them to one side of the baking tray and top with a small knob of butter then sprinkle over 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Add the chopped pistachios and chopped cranberries to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for a final 3-4 min or until the pistachios are slightly golden – this is your cranberry & pistachio crumb

Tip: Watch the pistachios like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 7

Once the carrot batons are cooked, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Mix the wilted spinach and caramelised carrot batons together – this is your buttery veg

### Step 8

Serve the garlicky hake with the cranberry & pistachio crumb sprinkled over the top and the crispy rosemary potatoes and buttery veg to the side

Pour the gravy all over

Enjoy!
