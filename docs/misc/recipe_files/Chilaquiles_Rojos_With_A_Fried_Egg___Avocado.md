## Ingredients

- Tomato x2
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Dried ancho chilli
- Plain tortillas (6pcs)
- Avocado
- Coriander (5g)
- British free range egg x2
- Shallot
- Garlic clove
- Lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Add your dried ancho chilli[es] to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soak

Stack your tortillas and slice them into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a large bowl with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until coated


### Step 2

Add the oiled triangles to a baking tray (make sure they don't overlap!) and put the tray in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 3

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel your garlic

Peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Drain the ancho chilli[es] and discard the stalk[s]


### Step 4

Add the ancho chilli[es] to a food processor with the chopped tomato, peeled garlic, shallot and coriander (save some leaves for a garnish!)

Add the juice of half your lime[s] with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of sugar, salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your rojos sauce


### Step 5

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!


### Step 7

Once the tortillas are crisp, return them all to the baking tray[s] and top with the rojos sauce

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through – these are your chilaquiles rojos

### Step 8

Serve the chilaquiles rojos topped with the sliced avocado and a fried egg

Crumble over your Greek cheese and season with a pinch of pepper

Serve with a lime wedge and the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
