## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar 
- 1 tbsp Italian balsamic vinegar
- 50g baby leaf mixed salad
- 135g British dry cured smoked streaky bacon
- 200g conchiglie
- 125g baby plum tomatoes
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 40g Italian hard cheese
- 125g fresh mozzarella 
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard 

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 350&deg;F/ Gas 4


Boil a kettle


Add the baby plum&nbsp;tomatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and sugar


Put them in the oven to slow-roast until serving (approx. 30 min)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the&nbsp;conchiglie&nbsp;to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the&nbsp;conchiglie&nbsp;for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the&nbsp;conchiglie, reserving 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> of the&nbsp;starchy pasta water


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the&nbsp;streaky bacon&nbsp;into small, bite-size pieces


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat and once hot, add 2/3 of the chopped&nbsp;bacon (save the rest for later!)


Cook for 3-4 min or until crisped, then transfer to kitchen paper and set aside (keep the pan!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel the&nbsp;garlic


Grate the&nbsp;Italian hard cheese


Grate the&nbsp;cheddar&nbsp;


Drain, pat dry and rip the&nbsp;mozzarella&nbsp;into small, bite-size pieces


### Step 5

Return the&nbsp;pan to a medium heat and once hot, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter


Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;flour&nbsp;and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms - this is your roux


Gradually whisk 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;milk&nbsp;into the roux and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains - this is your&nbsp;b&eacute;chamel sauce&nbsp;


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate the&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;into the&nbsp;b&eacute;chamel sauce&nbsp;and season with a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and&nbsp;pepper&nbsp;


Once thickened, add the&nbsp;Italian hard cheese,&nbsp;cheddar,&nbsp;wholegrain mustard,&nbsp;crispy bacon and&nbsp;drained conchigle&nbsp;with a few splashes of&nbsp;starchy pasta water&nbsp;to loosen the mixture


Tip: you want your sauce to be quite loose as it will continue to thicken in the oven!


### Step 7

Remove the slow roasted tomatoes from the oven and set them aside until serving


Increase the oven temperature to&nbsp;240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Transfer the&nbsp;cheesy pasta&nbsp;to an oven-proof dish, then top with the ripped mozzarella, panko breadcrumbs&nbsp;and the remaining chopped bacon, drizzle with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until it's golden

### Step 8

Meanwhile, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;- this is your&nbsp;balsamic dressing


Gently toss the&nbsp;baby leaf&nbsp;mixed&nbsp;salad with the slow roasted tomatoes&nbsp;and drizzle with the balsamic dressing when you're ready to serve


Enjoy!&nbsp;
