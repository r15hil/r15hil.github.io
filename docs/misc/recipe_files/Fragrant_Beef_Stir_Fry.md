## Description

"This fantastic recipe is a true Friday favourite, and cooks quicker than any takeaway delivery service! The stir-fry is made extra special with the addition of some sesame oil and shaoxing wine at the very end. This glosses the dish and ensures that all the ingredients are at their most flavourful.
