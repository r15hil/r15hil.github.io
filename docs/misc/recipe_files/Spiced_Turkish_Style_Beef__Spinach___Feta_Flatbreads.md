## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]


### Step 3

Once the mince has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add half the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Combine the diced tomato and the remaining diced onion in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together and set aside – this is your tomato salad


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic and ground cumin to the pan with the ground coriander, smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste, beef stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 5

Once boiling, wash your spinach, then add it to the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced beef filling


### Step 6

Divide the spiced beef filling between your tortillas (make sure to only cover one half of the tortilla with the filling!)

Break your feta up into small pieces on the top of the filling

Fold each tortilla over so you're left with 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>half moon-shaped sandwiches per person – these are your spiced Turkish-style beef, spinach & feta flatbreads


### Step 7

Add the spiced Turkish-style beef, spinach & feta flatbreads to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two)

Place a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12 min, or until the flatbreads are slightly browned and the cheese has melted

### Step 8

Serve the spiced Turkish-style beef, spinach & feta flatbreads with the tomato salad to the side

Enjoy!
