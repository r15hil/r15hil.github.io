## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 30g white miso paste
- 4 tbsp cornflour
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 2 gluten free brioche buns
- 20g chipotle paste 
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 15ml red wine vinegar
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Cut the gluten free brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the halved brioche, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Reserve the pan


### Step 3

Place your hand flat onto each chicken breast<span class="text-danger"> </span>portion

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces

Add the cornflour to a shallow bowl

Add the chicken breasts to the cornflour and coat well


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the shredded red cabbage, mayo and red wine vinegar in a separate bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your red cabbage slaw

Trim, then slice the spring onions finely


### Step 6

Once done, transfer the chicken to kitchen paper and wipe the pan clean

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the miso paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a splash of water

Whisk until fully combined and cook for 2 min or until thickened and warmed through


### Step 7

Once thickened, return the cooked chicken to the pan and turn until fully coated – this is your miso-chipotle chicken

### Step 8

Assemble the toasted brioche buns with some of the red cabbage slaw, the miso-chipotle chicken and sliced spring onion

Serve the chips and any remaining red cabbage slaw to the side

Enjoy!
