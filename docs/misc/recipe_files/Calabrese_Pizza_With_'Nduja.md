## Description

Calabria is known for its love of fiery chillies, so it’s no surprise their popular ‘Nduja sausage sizzles with vibrant spicy flavour. Top our flame-baked pizza base with sweet pointed pepper, fresh red chilli and 'Nduja to taste that Calabrian heat at home.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce

Tear your ‘Nduja into small bite-sized pieces

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the Calabrese pizza with 'Nduja with the salad to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad and season the pizza with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
