## Description

In this dish the chicken is marinated in balsamic vinegar which transforms into a glossy, tangy, sticky glaze when it cooks, cutting through the sweet, piny, cheesy risotto beautifully: a flavourful, unique contrast.

## Ingredients

- 160g arborio rice
- 5g fresh rosemary
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1 leek
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 100g parsnips
- 40g Italian hard cheese
- 2 shallots
- 2 garlic cloves
- 200g British diced chicken breast

## Instructions


### Step 1

Place the diced chicken in a bowl with half the balsamic vinegar (save the rest for step 6)


Add 1-2 tbsp olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper


Mix well and leave to marinate until step 4


### Step 2

Peel and chop the parsnip<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> into small bite-size pieces, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Slice the leek<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> across into thin coins


Set the coins in a sieve and rinse under cold water to remove any grit


Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop the shallots


Strip the rosemary leaves from the stalks


Finely chop the leaves and discard the stalks


Place a large, wide-based pan over a medium-high heat


### Step 4

Once hot, add the chicken to the dry pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic


Set the chicken aside on a plate for later and add 1-2 tbsp olive oil and a knob of butter to the pan


### Step 5

Once hot, add the parsnips and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly caramelised, stirring occasionally


Meanwhile, dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in 850ml <span class="text-danger">(1.7L)</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Add the rice, shallots, garlic, leek and rosemary to the pan and stir for 2 min


Add 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> stock and the remaining balsamic vinegar


Reduce the heat to medium and stir until nearly all the stock is absorbed


### Step 7

Continue to add the stock a quarter at a time, stirring continuously for 15-20 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is tender


Tip: Stirring releases the starch from the rice and makes it creamy


Return the chicken to the pot and cook for 3-4 min or until cooked through

### Step 8

Grate in half the cheese, add another knob of butter (optional) and stir through


Taste and tweak for seasoning, adding more if necessary


Serve and grate over the remaining cheese


Enjoy!
