### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges

### Step 2

Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Meanwhile, combine your egg[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> </span>flour and 50ml <span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>[100ml]</span> milk in a jug, then whisk in your dried oregano and a pinch of salt – this is your batter

Put the batter in the fridge to rest

Strip your thyme leaves from their stalks (discard the stalks), then finely chop the thyme leaves and parsley

### Step 3

Combine the chopped herbs with your horseradish sauce and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a bowl

Add your rump steak[s] to the bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up, then set aside to marinate

Add the drained potatoes to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min

### Step 4

Top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then chop into thick batons

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife (keep the skins on!)

Once the potatoes have had 15 min, add the carrot batons and garlic to the other side of the tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 30 min further or until everything is golden and tender

### Step 5

Fill 2 holes of a muffin tray per person with a very small drizzle of vegetable oil (about 1 tsp per hole) and put it in the oven for 8 min to heat up

Tip: No muffin tray? Fill a small oven-proof dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to make one giant Yorkshire!

After 8 min, remove the muffin tray from the oven and carefully drizzle the rested batter evenly into the hot oil

Return the tray to the oven for 20 min until puffed up and golden – these are your herby Yorkshires

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, and boil a full kettle

Once very hot, add the marinated rump steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

While the steak is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1611674921219-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the steak is done, transfer to a clean board to rest

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add your beef stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your gravy

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to the reserved pot with a pinch of salt and cover with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

### Step 8

Slice the rested rump steak finely and pour any resting juices from the board into the gravy

Drizzle your truffle oil over the roast potatoes – these are your truffled roasties

Serve the sliced rump steak with the truffled roasties, herby Yorkshires, roasted carrots & garlic and Tenderstem broccoli to the side, then drizzle the gravy all over

Enjoy!
