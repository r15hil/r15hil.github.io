## Ingredients

- 70g quinoa
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 15ml rice vinegar	
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 15ml soy sauce
- 100g salmon flakes
- 25g chilli jam	
- 1 sweet potato
- 5g coriander
- 15g pumpkin seeds 
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 broccoli

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse the quinoa under cold running water, then add it to a pot with a lid with 180ml<span class="text-danger"> [360ml] </span>cold water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered


### Step 2

Peel and chop the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into large pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 4-5 min or until the sweet potato is fork tender, once done, transfer the sweet potato to a plate and mash it out flat to help it cool down, reserve the bowl


### Step 3

While the sweet potato is in the microwave, cut the broccoli into small florets and cut the stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Add the broccoli florets and chopped stem to a baking tray (use baking paper to avoid mess!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min or until tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks


### Step 5

Return the cooled sweet potato to the reserved bowl with the salmon flakes, half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and most of the chopped coriander (save a little for garnish!)

Stir everything together until the fish cake mix is fully combined

Divide the mix into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, then shape into patties – these are your herby sweet potato & salmon fish cakes


### Step 6

Remove the broccoli from the oven after 10 min

Drizzle over the remaining soy sauce and sprinkle over the sliced garlic, chopped ginger, toasted sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds

Return the tray to the oven for 5 min or until the broccoli is lightly charred


### Step 7

While the broccoli is in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the herby sweet potato & salmon fish cakes and cook for 3-4 min on each side until browned and crispy, adding more vegetable oil if needed

Combine the chilli jam, rice vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your sweet chilli dressing

### Step 8

Combine the cooked quinoa and roasted broccoli and mix it together – these are your seeded broccoli grains

Serve the herby sweet potato & salmon fish cake over the seeded broccoli grains in bowls

Drizzle the sweet chilli dressing over the top and garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
