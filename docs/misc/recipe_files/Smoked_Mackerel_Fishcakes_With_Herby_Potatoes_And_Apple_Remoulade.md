## Ingredients

- 50g soft cheese
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 10g dill & chives
- 21g wholegrain mustard 	
- 1 x 100g British smoked mackerel fillet
- 1 leek
- 1 apple
- 300g waxy potatoes

## Instructions


### Step 1

Cut the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half and wash carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice very finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add the sliced leek, a pinch of salt and 30ml<span class="text-danger"> [60ml]</span> cold water, then cook for 5 min or until the water has evaporated


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Chop the waxy potatoes (skins on) in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Peel the skin off the smoked mackerel fillet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and discard

Flake the smoked mackerel into very small, bite-sized pieces

Combine the flaked mackerel in a large bowl with the soft cheese, panko breadcrumbs and cooked leek, reserve the pan

Season with a pinch of both salt and pepper, knead well and divide the mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>then shape into patties – these are your smoked mackerel fishcakes


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a low heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the smoked mackerel fishcakes and cook for 3-4 min on each side until browned and crispy, adding more vegetable oil if needed

Tip: Flip gently and resist moving the patties so they hold their shape!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the dill finely

Chop the chives finely (keep both herbs separate)

Cut the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) into very fine matchsticks


### Step 6

Combine the mayo, wholegrain mustard, chopped dill and apple matchsticks with a pinch of pepper – this is your apple remoulade


### Step 7

Add a knob of butter, the chopped chives and a grind of pepper to the drained potatoes and give everything a good mix up – these are your herby potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the smoked mackerel fishcakes with the herby potatoes and apple remoulade to the side

Enjoy!
