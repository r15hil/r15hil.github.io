### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice on the diagonal

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and cook for 2 min or until slightly browned

### Step 3

Add your giant couscous and saffron to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the giant couscous for 8 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot – this is your saffron giant couscous

Add your vegetable stock mix and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Top with your basa fillet[s] and cook for 5 min, turning once half way or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened – this is your ras el hanout basa stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily
