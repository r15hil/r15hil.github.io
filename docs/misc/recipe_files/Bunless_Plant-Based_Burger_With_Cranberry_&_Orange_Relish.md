### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into thick chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (reserve the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges

### Step 2

While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely dice half your shallot[s]

Peel and finely slice the remaining shallot

Chop your dried cranberries roughly

Cut your orange[s] in half

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 3

Combine your white wine vinegar with your wholegrain mustard and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar and whisk together – this is your mustard vinaigrette

Combine your mayo with the truffle oil in a separate bowl – this is your truffle mayo

### Step 4

Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and put in the oven for 30 min or until crispy and golden – these are your twice cooked chips

### Step 5

While the chips are in the oven, heat the reserved pot over a medium heat with a small drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened, then add the chopped cranberries, 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water, the juice of half your orange[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix everything together and cook over a medium-low heat for 15-20 min or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your cranberry & orange relish

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the remaining orange, then cut each slice in half

Tip: Use a sharp knife to get rid of any pith!

Cut your lettuce into 2 thin wedges per person, give them a wash and pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

When the chips have 10 min left, remove them from the oven, then shake and turn them and return them to the oven until crispy and golden

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your meat-free patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on each side or until the burger is cooked through and lightly charred

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free patty with the twice cooked chips and lettuce wedges to the side

Top the lettuce wedges with the sliced orange and sliced shallot and drizzle the mustard vinaigrette over the top

Dollop the cranberry & orange relish over the patty and serve the truffle mayo to the side with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
