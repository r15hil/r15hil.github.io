## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, slice 1 lemon round per person

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Top each piece of chicken with a lemon round and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 4

Dissolve your cornflour in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[275ml]</span> boiled water

Add the chicken stock mix, soy sauce and honey and whisk until smooth

Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon – this is your lemon stock

Wash your shredded kale, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Add the shredded kale to a large baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until crispy – this is your crispy kale


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the lemon stock and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened

Once thickened, remove from the heat and stir through your toasted sesame oil – this is your lemon sauce


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board

Slice the cooked chicken finely into strips (you can add the lemon slices to your sauce!)

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken over the brown rice with the crispy kale to the side

Drizzle over the lemon sauce and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
