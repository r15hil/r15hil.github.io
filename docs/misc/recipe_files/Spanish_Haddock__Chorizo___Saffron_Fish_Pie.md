## Ingredients

- 80g trimmed fine green beans

- 4 white potatoes
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 100g British diced chorizo
- 1/2 Knorr vegetable stock cube
- 5g parsley
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 200g haddock bites
- 150g cavolo nero

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the potatoes (skins-on) into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Re boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp

Whilst the chorizo is cooking add the saffron to 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water and set aside to infuse – this is your saffron stock


### Step 4

Once the chorizo is beginning to crisp, add the sliced onion and garlic and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the onion has softened

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>Knorr vegetable stock cube and the tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the dried oregano, smoked paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the tomato stock and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened slightly

Add the haddock bites, with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon, a grind of pepper and stir it all together – this is your fish pie mix

Transfer the fish pie mix to an oven-proof dish


### Step 6

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add the saffron stock with a splash of milk and a large knob of butter

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your saffron mash

Top the fish pie mix with the saffron mash

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the mash is golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Spanish haddock, chorizo & saffron fish pie


### Step 7

Whilst the pie is in the oven, re-boil a kettle

Chop the cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Add the chopped cavolo nero and green beans to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the tender

Drain and return to the pot, then squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon over the greens - these are your lemony greens

### Step 8

Once done, remove the pie from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Serve the Spanish haddock, chorizo & saffron fish pie with the lemony greens to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
