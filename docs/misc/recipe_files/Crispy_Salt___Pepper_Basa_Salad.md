### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 3

Add your chopped basa to a bowl with half your cornflour and half of your tamari soy sauce (save the rest for later!)

Give everything a good mix up so the basa is fully coated

Add the remaining cornflour to a separate bowl

Add the basa to the bowl with the remaining cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the basa is coated

### Step 4

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Trim, then slice your spring onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil  over a medium-high heat

### Step 5

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated basa with a good grind of pepper and cook for 3-4 min on each side until golden, crispy and cooked through (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily)

Once cooked through, add the sliced spring onion, sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant – this is your crispy salt & pepper basa

### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, wash your lettuce, remove the outer leaves and set aside, then shred the inner core

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

### Step 7

Add your rice vinegar and chilli relish to a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining tamari soy sauce – this is your sweet chilli dressing

Add the cooked rice, sliced cucumber, carrot ribbons and lettuce to a large bowl with the sweet chilli dressing

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the crispy salt & pepper basa over the sweet chilli rice salad

Enjoy!
