Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 3-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite
