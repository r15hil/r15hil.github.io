### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] lengthways, so that you end up with 3 strips per person

### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the chicken breast strips and pour over your soy sauce

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika and ground allspice into the pan and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your blackened chicken

### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, drain and roughly chop your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Peel, then slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Wash your gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Dollop over the chipotle mayo

Enjoy!
