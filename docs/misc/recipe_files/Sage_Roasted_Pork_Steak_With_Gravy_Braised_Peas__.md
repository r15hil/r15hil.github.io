## Ingredients

- British pork loin steaks (300g)
- Parsnip x2
- Sage (5g)
- British pork loin steak (150g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Brown onion
- White potato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop your parsnip[s] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Strip your sage leaves from their stems and discard the stems


### Step 2

Add the chopped potato and chopped parsnip to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised

Once caramelised, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min further


### Step 5

Trim the fat from your pork loin steak[s] and season each steak with a pinch of salt and pepper

Lay the sage leaves on top of each steak then drizzle with vegetable oil


### Step 6

Once the potato and parsnip have had 15 min, add the seasoned steak and any extra sage leaves to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 13-15 min or until the pork steaks are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your sage-roasted pork steak[s]

Boil half a kettle


### Step 7

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water - this is your chicken stock

Add a knob of butter and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the caramelised onions and cook for 1 min

Add the chicken stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until reduced to a gravy-like consistency

Once reduced, add your blanched peas and cook for a final 1 min or until they're warmed through – these are your gravy-braised peas

### Step 8

Serve the roasted potato & parsnip and spoon over the gravy-braised peas

Top with the sage-roasted pork steak

Enjoy!
