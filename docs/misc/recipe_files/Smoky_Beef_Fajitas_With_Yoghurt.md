## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 250g British beef strips
- 300g chopped pepper & red onion
- 15ml soy sauce 
- 6 seeded tortillas
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp smoked paprika

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Tip: This is to warm your tortillas – alternatively, add them to a plate and pop in the microwave!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper & red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min until starting to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the seeded tortillas to 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add the tortillas to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)


### Step 3

Once the veg has softened, add the smoked paprika, ground cumin, beef strips and soy sauce

Add a grind of black pepper and sear for 1-2 min, this will prevent the beef strips from overcooking – this is your smoky beef fajita filling


### Step 4

Wash, then tear the little gem lettuce into rough pieces

### Step 5

Fill each warmed tortilla with the torn little gem lettuce and smoky beef fajita filling

Dollop over the natural yoghurt

Enjoy!
