## Ingredients

- 2 wholewheat noodle nests
- 15ml rice vinegar 
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 carrot
- 30ml soy sauce
- 80g mangetout
- 200g haddock bites
- 1 spring onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small petals

Top, tail and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin batons

Slice the mangetout in half lengthways


### Step 2

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot, cover them with boiled water until fully submerged and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain the soaked noodles and return to the pot


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the carrot batons, onion petals and halved mangetout with a pinch of salt

Cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 5

While the vegetables are cooking, combine the soy sauce and rice vinegar with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your stir-fry sauce

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 6

Once the veg has softened, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min, then transfer everything to the pot with the drained noodles, reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, then pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add the haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) with a grind of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Add the stir-fry sauce to the noodles and veg and give everything a good mix up until well combined - this is your mangetout stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the cooked haddock bites over the mangetout stir-fry

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
