- 150g fragrant basmati rice
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 250g British pork stir fry strips 
- 80g sugar snap peas
- 1 spring onion
- 1 tbsp white rice vinegar 
- 1 knob of fresh root ginger (15g)
- 3 soy sauce sachets (24ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the&nbsp;basmati rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!


Roll the&nbsp;zested lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


### Step 3

Combine&nbsp;the chopped&nbsp;ginger, lime zest, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime,&nbsp;toasted&nbsp;sesame oil, soy sauce, a splash of water and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]&nbsp;</span>sugar (preferably brown)


Mix everything together thoroughly - this is your teriyaki sauce


### Step 4

Peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice the sugar snap peas and the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> very finely


Mix the grated carrot, snap peas and spring onion together in a bowl with the rice wine vinegar and a pinch of salt&nbsp;- this is your snap pea slaw


### Step 5

Heat a&nbsp;large pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the pork&nbsp;strips with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-5 min or until it's starting to brown


### Step 6

Add the teriyaki sauce to the pan


Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has reduced to a sticky consistency - this is your pork teriyaki


Meanwhile, slice the remaining lime into wedges


### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the&nbsp;pork teriyaki from the heat and sprinkle it with the toasted&nbsp;sesame seeds


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the pork teriyaki over the cooked rice, with the snap pea slaw to the side


Garnish with the&nbsp;lime wedges


Enjoy!
