### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large bite-sized pieces

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

While the onion softens, rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has started to soften, add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, tomato paste, chopped garlic and chopped pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock and half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the chipotle paste (cooking for 2? Save the remaining for another recipe) with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 10-15 min or until starting to thicken

### Step 5

While the sauce thickens, drain and rinse the kidney beans

Once the sauce is starting to thicken, add the drained kidney beans and cook for a further 10 min or until a stew-like consistency remains – this is your beany chilli

### Step 6

While the beany chilli is cooking, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half, and cut 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> into wedges

### Step 7

Combine the smashed avocado with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt – this is your avocado salsa

### Step 8

Serve the beany chilli with the brown rice and avocado salsa to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and reserved lime wedges

Enjoy!
