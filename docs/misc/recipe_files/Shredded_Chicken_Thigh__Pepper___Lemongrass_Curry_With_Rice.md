## Instructions

### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs with a large pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side until browned

Once browned, transfer them to a tin foil-lined baking tray (save the pan!) and put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is cooking, return the pan to a medium-high heat

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a big pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 5 min, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 min further or until softened and caramelised

### Step 4

Meanwhile, place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and your garlic, then finely chop (or grate) both

Bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the soft inner core[s] finely

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/V2-545-step-5-1-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add your basmati rice, 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml] </span>cold water and the outer lemongrass layers to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/V2-545-step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped lemongrass core, curry powder and most of your nigella seeds (save the rest for garnish!) to the onion pan and cook for 2 min

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/V2-545-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the cooked chicken to the pan with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, the softened creamed coconut and the chicken stock mix

Mix well and cook, covered for a further 5 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, shred the cooked chicken apart in the pan using two forks and give everything a good mix – this is your shredded chicken thigh, pepper & lemongrass curry

### Step 8

Stir half of the chopped coriander through the shredded chicken thigh, pepper & lemongrass curry and serve with the lemongrass rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and nigella seeds

Enjoy!
