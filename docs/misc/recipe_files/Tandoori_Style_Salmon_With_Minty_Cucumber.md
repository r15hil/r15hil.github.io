## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Combine your curry powder with half your roasted garlic paste, half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt in a bowl

Add your salmon fillet[s] and combine until fully coated


### Step 3

Once hot, add the coated salmon fillet[s], skin-side down to the pan

Cook for 5-6 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your tandoori salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

While the salmon is cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and slice roughly

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 5

Add the sliced cucumber and mint leaves to a bowl with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up – this is your minty cucumber


### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add your cooked brown long grain rice and spinach with a splash of water and cook, covered for 3-4 min until warmed through – this is your brown rice & spinach


### Step 7

Combine the remaining roasted garlic paste with the remaining natural yoghurt in a bowl – this is your garlic yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori-style salmon with the brown rice & spinach and minty cucumber to the side and a dollop of garlic yoghurt on top

Sprinkle over your nigella seeds

Enjoy!
