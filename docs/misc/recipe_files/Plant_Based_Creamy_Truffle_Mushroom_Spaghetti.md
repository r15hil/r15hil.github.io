## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 3

Transfer the toasted pine nuts to a small bowl and set aside for later

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands


### Step 4

Add your roasted garlic paste to the pan with a generous pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 5

While the mushrooms are cooking, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Turn the heat down to medium-high and add your creamy single soy and vegetable stock mix to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has slightly thickened

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your plant-based creamy mushroom sauce


### Step 7

Add the cooked spaghetti to the plant-based creamy mushroom sauce and stir everything together – this is your plant-based creamy mushroom spaghetti

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based creamy mushroom spaghetti with the toasted pine nuts sprinkled over the top

Drizzle over your truffle oil – this is your plant-based creamy truffle mushroom spaghetti

Chop your chives finely over the spaghetti with scissors

Enjoy!
