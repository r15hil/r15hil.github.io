### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your black mustard seeds and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your spiced fries

### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a bowl with your garam masala, chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced chicken
