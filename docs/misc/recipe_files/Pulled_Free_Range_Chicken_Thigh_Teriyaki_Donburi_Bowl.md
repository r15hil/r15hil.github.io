## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop into thin matchsticks

Slice your cucumber[s] finely


### Step 3

Combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved

Add your red wine vinegar, ginger matchsticks and sliced cucumber and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled vegetables


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs and season them with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned on both sides

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic, tamari soy sauce, mirin, honey and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>boiled water

Cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened and is sticky in consistency


### Step 6

Whilst the sauce is thickening, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Slice your mangetout in half lengthways

Add the sliced mangetout to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften


### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mix the pulled chicken into the pan juices – this is your pulled chicken teriyaki

Drain the quick-pickled vegetables through a sieve

Drain the mangetout

### Step 8

Serve the pulled free range chicken teriyaki over the cooked rice, with the grated carrot, quick-pickled vegetables and mangetout to the side

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
