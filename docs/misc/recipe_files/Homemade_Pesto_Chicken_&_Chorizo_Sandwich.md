### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water to the pan, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, peel your garlic

Add the peeled garlic to a food processor with your basil, grated Italian hard cheese, pine nut & seed mix, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water, a pinch of salt and the juice of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s]

Blitz until well combined and smooth – this is your homemade pesto

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

### Step 4

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board (discard any liquid and reserve the pan) and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

### Step 6

Add the pulled chicken and homemade pesto in a bowl with a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your pesto chicken

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add your diced chorizo and sliced pepper and cook for 5-6 min or until crisp and beginning to char

Add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until warmed through, then carefully slice in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Separate the charred pepper from the cooked chorizo

Spread your mayo on the warmed ciabatta base with the cooked chorizo, pesto chicken and a handful of salad and top with the warmed ciabatta lid

Serve the remaining salad to the side with the charred pepper and torn mozzarella on top

Drizzle over your balsamic vinegar and serve the crispy potatoes to the side and enjoy!
