## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your nigella seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden – these are your nigella seed chips


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Chop your chicken breast strips into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add 2/3 of the chopped onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

While the onion is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, increase the heat to high, then add the chopped chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and curry powder to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Add the coconut stock, ground almonds and a pinch of sugar to the pan and cook for 6-8 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, dice your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the diced tomatoes, chopped coriander and remaining chopped onion to a bowl and mix to combine – this is your tomato & onion salad


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, stir in your natural yoghurt and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your creamy chicken korma

### Step 8

Serve your creamy chicken korma with the nigella seed chips and the tomato & onion salad to the side

Enjoy!
