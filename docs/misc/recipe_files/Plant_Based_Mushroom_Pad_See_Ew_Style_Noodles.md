Once softened, drain the noodles, reserving 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [225ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[300ml]</span> starchy noodle water


### Step 2

Meanwhile, tear your chestnut mushrooms into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the torn mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until golden brown all over


### Step 3

While the mushrooms are cooking, chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Top, tail, and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Slice each individual carrot disc into matchsticks


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, keeping the whites and greens separate

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don't have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!


### Step 5

Once the mushrooms are golden brown, add the halved Tenderstem and carrot matchsticks to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the broccoli is almost tender


### Step 6

While the vegetables are cooking, combine your vegetable stock mix and cornflour in a measuring jug

Gradually stir in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>starchy noodle water

Add your hoisin sauce, gluten free soy sauce, rice vinegar and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your hoisin stock


### Step 7

Once the broccoli is almost tender, add the chopped garlic and spring onion whites to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the hoisin stock with a pinch of pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until it begins to thicken, then add the cooked rice noodles

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the sauce is thick and coating the noodles – this is your mushroom pad see ew-style noodles

### Step 8

Serve the mushroom pad see ew-style noodles topped with the spring onion greens and crushed peanuts

Drizzle your sriracha over the top (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
