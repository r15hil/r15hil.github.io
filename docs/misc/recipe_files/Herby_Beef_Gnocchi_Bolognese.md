## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi


### Step 4

Once the beef mince has started to brown, add your Marmite to the pan with your dried oregano, dried basil, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Add your chopped tomatoes with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml] </span>boiled water, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until the beef has cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency

Note: Please make sure you cook your beef mince thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies


### Step 6

Once the sauce has thickened, add in the drained gnocchi and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby beef gnocchi bolognese


### Step 7

Tear your basil leaves over the herby beef gnocchi bolognese

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the herby beef gnocchi bolognese

Top with your grated Italian hard cheese and salad, then dig in

Enjoy!
