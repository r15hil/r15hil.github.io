## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo, roasted garlic paste, ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock, macaroni, chopped tomatoes and dried oregano to the pan

Cover with a lid and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for an initial 3 min


### Step 5

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Top, tail and grate your courgette[s]

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 6

Add the grated carrot, grated courgette and drained chickpeas to the pan and cook, covered, for 3 min further or until the macaroni is cooked with a slight bite

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once the pasta is cooked, stir through your shredded kale, most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your one-pot chorizo minestrone

Tip: If it's looking a little thick, add a splash of water

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot chorizo minestrone 

Garnish with the reserved chopped basil

Enjoy!
