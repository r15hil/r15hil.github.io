### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and sprinkle over your dried oregano, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are golden and crispy

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your halloumi in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

Add 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water to a wide-based deep pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add the halloumi half[ves] and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] finely

Peel your garlic and chop in half, discard the skin

Chop (or grate) half of the garlic finely (you'll use the rest later!)

Heat a pot with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

### Step 4

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes, chopped garlic, your ground smoked paprika and half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomato is starting to break down

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> water and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook for 5-8 min or until thickened to a chutney-like consistency – this is your smoky tomato relish

### Step 5

Once softened, drain and pat the halloumi half[ves] dry with kitchen paper (save the pan!)

Using a rolling pin, flatten the halloumi half[ves] into a similar size as the ciabatta – this is your halloumi steak[s]

### Step 6

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half, add to a separate baking tray (or two!) and drizzle with olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 4 min or until slightly crispy, then remove from the oven and leave to cool

Combine the remaining red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper– this is your dressing

Once cooled, rub the remaining garlic into the crispy ciabatta

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/865.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the potato wedges are nearly cooked, return the wide-based pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halloumi steak[s] to the pan and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden

Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and toss it in the dressing

### Step 8

To assemble, fill the garlicky ciabatta with the halloumi steak and top with the smoky tomato relish and a handful of dressed salad – this is your halloumi burger

Serve the remaining dressed salad, any remaining smoky tomato relish and the wedges to the side

Enjoy!
