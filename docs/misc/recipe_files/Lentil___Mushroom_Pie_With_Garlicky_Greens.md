## Ingredients

- Tomato paste (16g)
- Cooked black beluga lentils (250g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Shredded kale (120g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your beluga lentils to the onion with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a generous grind of pepper

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 1-2 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and soy sauce in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your vegetable stock


### Step 5

Add half the chopped garlic to the pan (save the rest for later!) with the sliced mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

Add the vegetable stock, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your lentil & mushroom pie mix

Wash your shredded kale, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden – this is your pie lid


### Step 7

Once the pastry is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter

Once hot, add the shredded kale with the remaining chopped garlic and a small splash of cold water and cook for 2-3 min or until tender – these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Serve the pie lid over the lentil & mushroom pie mix with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!
