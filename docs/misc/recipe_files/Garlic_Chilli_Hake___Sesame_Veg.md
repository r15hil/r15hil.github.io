## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake and cornflour to a bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated hake


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – this is your soy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once golden, transfer the soy hake to a plate and set aside for later, reserving the pan


### Step 4

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the carrot discs to the pan and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until the carrot is starting to soften


### Step 5

While the carrot is cooking, trim, then chop your green beans into bite-size pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 6

Combine your chilli relish and toasted sesame oil in a bowl with the remaining soy sauce, rice vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame chilli sauce


### Step 7

Once the carrot has softened, add the chopped pepper and chopped green beans to the pan with the chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until the vegetables have slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the sesame chilli sauce and soy hake and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the hake is warmed through and the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your garlic chilli hake & sesame veg

### Step 8

Serve the cooked rice and top with the garlic chilli hake & sesame veg

Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
