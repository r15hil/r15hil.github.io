## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin until it splits open

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the bashed lemongrass and diced chicken breast to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until lightly browned


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and cut into quarters lengthwise – these are your lettuce wedges

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts


### Step 4

Add your cornflour, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tamari soy sauce to a bowl with your tamarind paste, half your honey (save the rest for later!), ginger & garlic paste and 70ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[120ml]</span> cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tamarind sauce


### Step 5

Once lightly browned, add the tamarind sauce to the chicken and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop your lime[s] into wedges

Once cooked through, add generous squeeze of lime juice and mix it all together – this is your tamarind & lemongrass chicken


### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Combine the chopped peanuts and the remaining honey in a bowl with a generous squeeze of lime juice (reserve some lime for a garnish!), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil - this is your peanut & lime dressing

### Step 8

Discard the lemongrass stalk[s]

Serve the tamarind & lemongrass chicken over the cooked rice with the grated carrot and lettuce wedges to the side

Drizzle the peanut & lime dressing over the carrot and wedges

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
