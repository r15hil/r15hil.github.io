## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Cut your baby corn in half lengthways


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and curry powder and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, creamed coconut and peanut butter in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your peanut stock

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Once the onion is softened, add the halved baby corn and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 2 min or until the garlic is fragrant


### Step 6

Once lightly browned, add your mangetout, peanut stock, soy sauce, lime leaves and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 6-7 min or until the vegetables are tender


### Step 7

Once the rice is tender, add your shredded kale to the pot and cook for 3-4 min further

Once done, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving – this is your brown rice & kale

### Step 8

Once the veg is tender, squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s] into the pan – this is your vegetable satay curry

Slice the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the vegetable satay curry next to the brown rice & kale
