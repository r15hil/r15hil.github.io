### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further

Add the beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

Whilst the mince is browning, top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Once the mince has browned, add the sliced courgette to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the courgette has started to soften

### Step 5

Dissolve the beef stock mix and the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and chopped tomatoes and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your harissa beef mince ragù

### Step 6

Whilst the beef ragù is cooking, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk

Crumble in half of the Greek cheese and add half of the chopped parsley and mint (you'll use the rest later!)

Mash until smooth then taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed – this is your herby Greek cheese mash

### Step 8

Serve the herby Greek cheese mash on a plate, make a well in the centre and fill with the harissa beef mince ragù

Crumble over the remaining Greek cheese and sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
