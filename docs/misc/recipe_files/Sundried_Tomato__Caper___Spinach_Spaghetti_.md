### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Roughly chop the sun-dried tomatoes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 1-2 min

### Step 7

Add the spinach to a colander and use the remaining boiled water in your kettle to pour over it so that it starts to wilt

Add the wilted spinach to the pan with a very generous crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your sun-dried tomato, caper & spinach sauce

### Step 8

Serve the sun-dried tomato, caper & spinach sauce over the cooked spaghetti

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
