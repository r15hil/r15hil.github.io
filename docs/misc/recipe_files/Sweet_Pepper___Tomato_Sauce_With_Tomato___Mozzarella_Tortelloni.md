### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

### Step 4

Add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 5

Combine your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix, dried oregano and balsamic vinegar with 80ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[105ml]</span> [130ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 6

Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and a generous pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce thickens slightly

### Step 7

Add the drained tortelloni to the sauce with a knob of butter and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your sweet pepper & tomato tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the sweet pepper & tomato tortelloni topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the chopped basil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
