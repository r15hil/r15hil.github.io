## Description

This dish of Spanish chorizo with couscous and Moroccan spice mix, ras el hanout, is a delicious example of how Spanish cuisine has been influenced by North African ingredients.  The bright red colour and distinctive smoky flavour of traditional Spanish chorizo comes from pimento (a.k.a. smoked paprika)

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Transfer the cooked&nbsp;chorizo (use a slotted spoon if you have one) to a bowl, leaving the oil in the pan


Return&nbsp;the pan to a medium-low heat and add the red onion


### Step 4

Cook the red onion for 3 min or until starting to soften and turn translucent&nbsp;


Tip: Add more olive oil if the onion looks dry


Meanwhile, slice the cherry tomatoes in half


Add the halved tomatoes to the red onions for a further 3-5 min


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 320ml <span class="text-danger">[640ml]</span><span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>boiled water


Add the garlic, ras el hanout and bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>&nbsp;to the onion&nbsp;and stir for 1 min


### Step 6

Bring to a boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 5-10 min or until the couscous is tender and the water has absorbed


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


Once the couscous is cooked, remove the lid and add the cooked, drained lentils and chorizo


Cover&nbsp;and cook for a couple of min further to warm through, adding a few more tbsp of water to prevent drying out

### Step 8

Meanwhile, add the yoghurt to the bowl that had the cooked chorizo in (for added smokiness) with a pinch of salt and pepper


Stir&nbsp;the chopped&nbsp;parsley&nbsp;through the chorizo couscous, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and&nbsp;pepper if needed&nbsp;


Serve&nbsp;with a dollop of yoghurt and enjoy!
