### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your waxy potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Set everything aside until later

### Step 3

Pat your cod fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Season the cod fillet[s] with a generous pinch of salt

### Step 4

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat the seasoned cod in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it into the beaten egg and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

### Step 5

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to break down

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs, then add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>water with a pinch of pepper and sugar and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened

### Step 6

While the tomato sauce is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated cod and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through – this is your breaded cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

Combine your wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) with your white wine vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your mustard dressing

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through the chopped basil and a knob of butter – this is your tomato & basil sauce

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the breaded cod over the tomato & basil sauce with the crispy potatoes and salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the mustard dressing

Enjoy!
