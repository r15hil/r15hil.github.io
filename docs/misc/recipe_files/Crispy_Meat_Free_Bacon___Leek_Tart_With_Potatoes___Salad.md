### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your meat-free bacon lardons to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy

Once the meat-free bacon is starting to crisp, transfer to a plate and set aside until later, reserving the pan

### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!

### Step 6

Spread the soft cheese mixture over the pastry within the border

Add the softened leeks and top with the crispy meat-free bacon

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up – this is your crispy meat-free bacon & leek tart

### Step 7

When the tart is nearly cooked, add your dijon mustard to a bowl with your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your mustard dressing

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the dressing and toss – this is your mustard sala

### Step 8

Cut the crispy meat-free bacon & leek tart in half and serve it with the roast potatoes and mustard salad to the side

Enjoy!
