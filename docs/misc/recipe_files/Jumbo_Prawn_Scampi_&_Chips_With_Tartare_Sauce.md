### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp

Add the diced shallot to a bowl with your mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper

Squeeze in the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and stir it all together – this is your tartare sauce

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to fully coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the coated jumbo prawns and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally, until the jumbo prawns are browned all over, crispy and cooked through – these are your jumbo prawn scampi

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
