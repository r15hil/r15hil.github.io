### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small pieces

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped potatoes with the tomato stock and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min or until tender

### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 4

Once the potatoes are tender, add your smoked paprika and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the diced peppers, chopped onion, diced chorizo and half the cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) and cook for 4-5 min further or until starting to crisp – this is your smoky chorizo hash

Tip: Stir the pan occasionally to prevent everything from sticking!

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine your natural yoghurt and remaining grated garlic (don't like raw garlic? Just add a little!) in a small bowl with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your garlic yoghurt

### Step 6

Reboil a kettle

Add the remaining cider vinegar to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl and toss – this is your dressed salad

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-8-1657642105845-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Bring a pot with plenty of boiled water to the boil over a high heat

Crack your eggs gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel and season them with salt and pepper – these are your poached eggs

### Step 8

To serve, top the smoky chorizo hash with a poached egg and serve the dressed salad to the side

Dollop over the garlic yoghurt and sprinkle the remaining parsley all over

Enjoy!
