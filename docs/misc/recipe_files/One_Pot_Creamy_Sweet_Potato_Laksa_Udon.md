### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges and bashed lemongrass to the pot with the chopped sweet potato and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown
