Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into chunks

### Step 2

Heat a pot (with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

### Step 6

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-14 min or until the rice and chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Stir halfway through, to stop it sticking!

Once cooked, put the lid back on and set aside, for 4-5 min – this is your one pot peri peri chicken & rice

### Step 7

Once the rice is ready, drain your sweetcorn

Add the drained sweetcorn to a bowl with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the bowl in the microwave for 1-2 min or until the butter has melted and the corn is warmed through – this is your buttered corn

### Step 8

Top the one pot peri peri chicken & rice with the buttered corn and drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
