- Ultimate vegan burger patties (2pcs)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Red chilli relish (25g)
- White potato x3
- Smooth peanut butter (26g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges


### Step 2

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and the smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the wedges are golden and crispy – these are your smoky wedges


### Step 3

While the wedges are in the oven, peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rings

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with the red wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar and salt

Set aside to pickle – these are your pickled shallots


### Step 4

Wash the lettuce, separate the leaves and set aside for serving then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Line a separate baking tray with baking paper

Add the ultimate vegan burger patties to the lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice the plant-based brioche buns in half


### Step 7

Once the patties are cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through

### Step 8

Drain the pickled shallots

Spread each brioche base with the mayo and each brioche lid with the chilli jam

Build your meat-free burger by topping the base with the pickled shallots, some lettuce leaves, a cheesy patty, some peanut butter and finish with the lid

Serve with the smoky wedges to the side

Enjoy!
