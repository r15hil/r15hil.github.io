## Description

We’ve created a simple dish here that encompasses all that’s good within Persian cuisine. Our lamb is crisped and flavoured with baharat, a lovely warm Arabic spice mix. Served over cucumber and carrot couscous with plump sultanas. All topped with crunchy toasted pistachios and a dollop of cool minty yoghurt.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pistachios and toast for 2 min or until they've darkened slightly

Once done, transfer the toasted pistachios to a board to cool and keep the pan


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the couscous and sultanas to a heatproof bowl with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside


### Step 4

Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely

Mix the chopped mint through the natural yoghurt – this is your minted yoghurt


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the lamb mince

Cook for 4 min until browned, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, crumble the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into the pan with the tomato paste and baharat and cook for 2 min

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 5 min or until the lamb has crisped

Dice the remaining cucumber

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 7

Fluff the couscous with a fork, add the grated carrot and chopped cucumber and season generously with salt and pepper

Add a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix – this is your carrot and cucumber couscous

Chop the toasted pistachios roughly

### Step 8

Serve the crispy lamb over the carrot and cucumber couscous

Dollop with the minted yoghurt and garnish with the chopped pistachios

Enjoy!
