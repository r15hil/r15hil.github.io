## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix
- 160g arborio rice
- 135g Jolly Good smoked streaky bacon
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 leek 
- 10g mint 
- 50g pea shoots
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Cut the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways and wash carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan with 1-2 tbsp olive oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 3-5 min or until softened and translucent


### Step 3

Meanwhile, lightly oil a baking tray and add the smoked streaky bacon

Put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until the bacon is crispy

Tip: Watch the bacon like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!


### Step 4

Whilst the bacon is cooking, dissolve the chicken stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water


### Step 5

Add the arborio rice to the softened leek and cook for 30 secs, stirring to coat the grains in oil

Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until it has almost evaporated

Add 1/3 of the chicken stock with a pinch of pepper

Once absorbed, continue to add the remaining stock, a little at a time, stirring almost constantly until the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Meanwhile, trim then slice the spring onions finely

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 7

Once crispy, roughly chop your bacon into bite-sized pieces

Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the sliced spring onion, chopped mint and half of the pea shoots – this is your pea shoot risotto

Serve the pea shoot risotto in bowls and garnish with the crispy bacon and remaining pea shoots

Season with a crack of pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
