## Ingredients

- 30g pine nut & seed mix
- 16g tomato paste
- 1 courgette
- 40g vegan 'nduja
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 190g linguine
- 0 linguine
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle, then peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, chopped pepper and chopped courgette to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion is starting to brown

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the vegetables are softened, stirring occasionally


### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nut & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden – these are your toasted seeds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and set aside


### Step 4

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Reboil half a kettle

Once the vegetables are softened, increase the heat to medium-high

Once hot, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your dried oregano and tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water and your vegetable stock mix to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has slightly thickened

While the sauce is thickening, add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter alternative and your ground smoked paprika to a heatproof bowl and microwave for 20 secs or until the butter has melted

Once melted, add your plant based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky plant based 'Nduja butter


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained linguine, smoky plant based 'Nduja butter to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky plant-based 'Nduja' linguine

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the smoky plant-based 'Nduja' linguine and top with the toasted seeds

Enjoy!
