### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Drain your pineapple thoroughly, stack them up and cut them into quarters

Drizzle with some olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 16-18 min or until the bacon is cooked through – these are your Marmite pineapple pizzas with bacon
