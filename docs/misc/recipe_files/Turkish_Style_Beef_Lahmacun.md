## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely dice half your red onion[s]

Slice your remaining onion finely

Add the sliced onion to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

While the beef is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] finely


### Step 4

Once browned, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 100ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> [150ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 4 min or until the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced beef mixture


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp


### Step 6

Combine your natural yoghurt with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic yoghurt

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Drain the quick-pickled red onion (save the pickling liquid!)


### Step 7

Once the the beef is cooked, divide the spiced beef mixture between the crispy tortillas and spread thinly – these are your Turkish-style beef lahmacuns

### Step 8

To serve, top each Turkish-style beef lahmacun with the quick-pickled red onion, chopped tomato and a dollop of garlic yoghurt

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle with a little olive oil and the reserved pickling liquid

Enjoy!
