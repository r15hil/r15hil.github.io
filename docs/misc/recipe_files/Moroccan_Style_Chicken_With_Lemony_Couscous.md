- 15g flaked almonds

- 30g diced apricots
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest your lemon[s] and cut into wedges


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ras el hanout and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until the onion has caramelised


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Chop your chicken breast portions into rough, bite-sized pieces

Dissolve half your chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Once the onion has caramelised, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min

Pour in the chicken stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce thickens


### Step 5

Once thickened, add the chopped chicken, halved green beans and diced apricots to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Moroccan-style chicken


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, add the lemon zest, remaining chicken stock mix and couscous to a heatproof bowl with a good grind of black pepper

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water to the bowl, then cover and set aside

Fluff with a fork before serving


### Step 7

Place your flaked almonds on a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until the almonds are lightly browned, then remove from the oven and leave to cool

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style chicken with the lemony couscous to the side and sprinkle the toasted almonds over the top

Garnish with the a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
