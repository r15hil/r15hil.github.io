## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Peel your parsnip[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a few parsnip ribbons

Dice the remaining parsnip[s]


### Step 2

Combine the chopped sweet potato and butternut squash cubes on one side of a baking tray with the diced parsnip and ground smoked paprika

Add a little drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min or until tender – this is your smoky roast veg


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a little drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, chop your potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] roughly


### Step 5

Once the onion has slightly softened, add your curry powder and tomato paste with the crushed garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped potato and carrots with 800ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.3L] </span>boiled water, your creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix

Bring to a boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 min or until the potato is tender – this is your soup base


### Step 6

Once the smoky roast veg has had an initial 20 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the parsnip ribbons in rows with a little drizzle of olive oil

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-5 min or until the ribbons are crisp

Once the ribbons are crisp, remove the tray[s] from the oven and set aside – this is your smoky roast veg and parsnip crisps


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are tender, remove the pot from the heat and blitz with a (stick) blender until smooth

Once smooth, add the smoky roast veg with a pinch of salt – this is your curried winter veg soup

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted, then slice into triangles

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the ciabatta once toasted!

### Step 8

Serve the curried winter veg soup and drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Top with the parsnip crisps and a grind of pepper

Serve the toasted ciabatta triangles to the side

Enjoy!
