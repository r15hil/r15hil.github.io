### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;over a high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;red onion petals&nbsp;with a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and a small splash of&nbsp;water, cover with a lid and cook for 3-4 min or until they're beginning to soften

### Step 5

Once done, add the sliced courgette to the red&nbsp;onion and cook for 3 min, stirring occasionally or until lightly browned and cooked but retaining a slight bite

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the black&nbsp;olives and capers together roughly and add them to a large mixing bowl


Add the red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar - this is your Greek&nbsp;dressing&nbsp;


Pick the dill leaves from their stalks and tear them apart&nbsp;

### Step 7

Break the crispy&nbsp;tortilla shards up into rough uneven pieces&nbsp;


Remove the warmed feta and tomato wedges from the oven and leave the feta to cool for 3-4 min (this stops it falling apart)


Add the cooked courgette,&nbsp;onion, tortilla shards,&nbsp;tomato wedges and dill leaves&nbsp; to the Greek&nbsp;dressing and give everything a good mix - this is your warm Greek salad


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the baked feta over the warm Greek salad&nbsp;


Garnish with the&nbsp;sumac


Enjoy!&nbsp;
