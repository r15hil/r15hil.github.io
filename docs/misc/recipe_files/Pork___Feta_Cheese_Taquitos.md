## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, increase the heat to high, then add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for a further 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 3

Once browned, add the chopped garlic, ground coriander, cumin seeds, half your ground smoked paprika  (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then cook for a further 2 min or until fragrant and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the pork is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

Chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes to a bowl with the chopped coriander, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Stir it all together – this is your tomato salsa


### Step 5

Once the pork mixture is cooked through, divide it evenly between your tortillas, covering half of the tortilla

Roll the tortillas tightly to form a cigar shape – these are your pork taquitos


### Step 6

Add the pork taquitos to a baking tray (or two!) with the seam facing down

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until they're starting to brown around the edges


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and remaining ground smoked paprika in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a grind of pepper – this is your paprika mayo

### Step 8

Serve the pork taquitos over the shredded lettuce and tomato salsa

Drizzle over the paprika mayo and crumble over your feta cheese

Enjoy!
