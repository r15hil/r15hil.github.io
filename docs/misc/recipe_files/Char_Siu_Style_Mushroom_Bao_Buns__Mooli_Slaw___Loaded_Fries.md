## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 25g agave nectar
- 1 6 bao buns
- 0 Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms
- 8ml Sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 30ml vegan mayonnaise
- 160g carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix
- 180g Fable® meaty pulled mushrooms
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 3 white potatoes
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 5g coriander
- 1 garlic clove
- 8ml soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your meaty pulled mushrooms to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your mooli slaw mix and rice vinegar to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/1 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled mooli slaw


### Step 4

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine the grated garlic, five-spice mix, hoisin sauce, agave and soy sauce in a bowl

Add 125ml <span class="text-purple">[175ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and a drizzle of vegetable oil and stir everything together – this is your char siu-style sauce


### Step 5

Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Pick your coriander leaves from the stalks, discard the stalks


### Step 6

After an initial 20 min, remove the dish with the meaty pulled mushrooms from the oven

Spoon the char siu-style sauce over the mushrooms and return them to the oven for 10-12 min further, basting them twice more until the sauce is thick and the mushrooms are nicely glazed – these are your char siu-style pulled mushrooms


### Step 7

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the char siu-styled pulled mushrooms and top with some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo and garnish with half of the crispy onions and coriander leaves (save the rest for later!) – these are your char siu-style mushroom bao buns

### Step 8

Serve the char siu-style mushroom bao buns with the fries and remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw to the side

Load up the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo, crispy onions and coriander leaves

Enjoy!
