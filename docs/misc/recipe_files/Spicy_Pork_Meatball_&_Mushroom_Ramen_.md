## Description

At Gousto we love smoky chipotle paste, which is remarkably similar to Korean chilli paste (but better!). We're pairing it with our moreish rice noodles to create a spicy ramen to go with our ginger pork meatballs, soy mushrooms and crispy sugar snap peas. (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).
