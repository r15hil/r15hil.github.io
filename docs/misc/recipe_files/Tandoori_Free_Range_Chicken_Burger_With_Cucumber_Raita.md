### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp

Once the chicken is nearly cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the sliced brioche bun[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the brioche is warmed through and toasted

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori free range chicken burger with the chips to the side
