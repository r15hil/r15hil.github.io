## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Peel and chop half your red onion[s] into wedges (you'll use the rest later!)


### Step 3

Add your sausages, chopped potato, chopped sweet potato and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are golden


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

While everything is in the oven, finely dice the remaining red onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min

Once everything has softened, add most of your curry powder (save a little for garnish!) and ground smoked paprika and cook for 30 secs


### Step 6

Add your tomato paste, Henderson's Relish, tomato ketchup and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick gravy-like consistency – this is your curried tomato sauce

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside

Warm through again just before serving


### Step 7

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to your shredded kale and massage it with clean hands so that it's evenly covered in oil

Once the sausages are cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and sprinkle over the shredded kale

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 3-4 min or until the kale is cooked and slightly crispy – this is your sausage tray bake

### Step 8

Serve the sausage tray bake with the curried tomato sauce drizzled all over

Sprinkle over the remaining curry powder – this is your German-style curried sausage tray bake

Enjoy!
