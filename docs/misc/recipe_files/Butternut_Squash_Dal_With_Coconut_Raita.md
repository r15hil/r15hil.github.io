## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the butternut squash cubes are fork-tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Once hot, add your black mustard seeds to the pan along with your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and crushed cardamom pods and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the drained lentils and coconut stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: Alternatively, add them to a baking tray and put them under the grill


### Step 6

Once the butternut squash is fork-tender, roughly mash it with a fork

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan along with the mashed butternut squash and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min until all the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened – this is your butternut squash dal


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add your cultured coconut and mint sauce to a bowl and mix it all together – this is your coconut raita

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

### Step 8

Slice the warmed pittas into triangles

Serve the butternut squash dal in bowls with the coconut raita and pitta triangles to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
