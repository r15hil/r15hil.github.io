## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 40g cheddar cheese 
- 20g mango chutney
- 2 tomatoes
- 4 rotis
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1 green chilli
- 3 white potatoes
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1/2 cucumber
- 20g coriander
- 125g mozzarella
- 1 shallot

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your nigella fries


### Step 2

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly (like it hot? Keep the seeds in!)

Peel and halve the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> shallot roughly, slice the remaining shallot finely


### Step 3

Add the sliced shallot to a medium bowl with half the white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and sugar, and a splash of<span class="text-danger"> </span>warm water

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot


### Step 4

Add the chopped coriander to a food processor with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped shallot and blitz until combined

Add the remaining white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and blitz to a coarse paste – this is your coriander chutney

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces and pat dry again

Grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Add 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> rotis to a baking tray (or two!) and top with the torn mozzarella, grated cheddar cheese, coriander chutney and a pinch of salt and pepper

Place the remaining rotis on top so you end up with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> roti sandwiches

Top each roti sandwich with a small knob of butter

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 8-10 min or until the cheese is melted – these are your Mumbai-style toasties


### Step 7

While the rotis are cooking, dice the cucumber finely

Chop the tomatoes finely

Add the chopped cucumber and chopped tomatoes to the bowl with the quick-pickled shallot and stir together – this is your kachumber salad

Add the mayo to a separate small bowl and swirl the mango chutney through (don’t fully mix) – this is your mango mayo

### Step 8

Chop the Mumbai-style toasties into quarters

Drain the kachumber salad, discard the liquid

Serve the Mumbai-style stuffed rotis with the nigella fries, kachumber salad and mango mayo to the side

Enjoy!
