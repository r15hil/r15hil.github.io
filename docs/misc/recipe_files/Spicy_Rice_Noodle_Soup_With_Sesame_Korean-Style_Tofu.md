### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the softened noodles and set aside

### Step 2

Reboil a full kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then tear into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the torn tofu and half your gluten free soy sauce (save the rest for later!) to a large bowl and mix it all together

Once fully combined, add your cornflour to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is fully coated

### Step 3

Peel and finely grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add half your gochujang paste (save the rest for later!) and rice vinegar to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy Korean-style sauce

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until the tofu is crispy and golden – this is your crispy tofu

Once crispy, transfer it to kitchen paper, reserving the pan

### Step 5

Heat a large pot with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the grated garlic and remaining gochujang paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pot and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the remaining gluten free soy sauce, pho broth paste, vegetable stock mix and 700ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy broth

### Step 6

Bring the spicy broth to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-high

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the pot and cook for 1-2 min or until the veg is softened

Once the veg has softened, add the softened noodles to the pot and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy rice noodle soup

### Step 7

Meanwhile, carefully pour away the oil from the reserved pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat, then add the crispy tofu, spicy Korean-style sauce and your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened and the tofu is coated – this is your sesame Korean-style tofu

### Step 8

Serve the spicy rice noodle soup in a bowl and top with the sesame Korean-style tofu

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
