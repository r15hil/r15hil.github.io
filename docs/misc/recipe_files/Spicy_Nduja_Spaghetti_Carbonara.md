### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, tear your 'Nduja into the pan (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

### Step 3

While the 'Nduja is softening, add your quick cook spaghetti and Tenderstem broccoli to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spaghetti and Tenderstem broccoli are cooked with a slight bite, then drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Return the drained spaghetti and Tenderstem broccoli to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and stir it all together

### Step 4

Once the 'Nduja has softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, separate your egg yolk[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the whites by cracking your egg[s] over a small bowl and catching the yolk in the shell

Transfer the yolk from one shell half to the other several times, until all the whites are in the bowl and you are left with the yolk in the shell

Tip: Hold on to those egg whites! They’re perfect for meringues or a protein-rich omelette (they freeze well too)

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1596539021782-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Combine the egg yolk[s] in a jug with your crème fraîche, half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together – this is your carbonara sauce

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1596539025825-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and add the drained spaghetti & Tenderstem broccoli

Add the carbonara sauce with a splash of reserved starchy pasta water and the spinach and mix until fully combined – this is your spicy 'Nduja spaghetti carbonara

Tip: Mix the sauce through the pasta quickly to avoid scrambling the egg!

### Step 8

Serve the spicy 'Nduja spaghetti carbonara topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
