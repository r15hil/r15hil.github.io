Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your slow cooker and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg


### Step 2

Turn on your slow cooker to high


### Step 3

Grate your chestnut mushrooms and garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add the grated mushrooms, garlic and a knob of butter to the pan

Add your tomato paste and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the mushrooms are softened


### Step 4

Add the contents of your pan to the slow cooker with your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix, balsamic vinegar and oregano

Cover and cook on high for 3 hours – this is your mushroom ragù

After 3 hours, boil a kettle

Break your spaghetti in half and add it to the slow cooker with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water, stirring everything to separate the strands

Roughly tear the mozzarella and basil leaves over the top of the tomatoes

Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper – this is your caprese salad

### Step 8

To serve, give the mushroom ragù spaghetti a good mix up with a fork to separate the strands of pasta and sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese all over
