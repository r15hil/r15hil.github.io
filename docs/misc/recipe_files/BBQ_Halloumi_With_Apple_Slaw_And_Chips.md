### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the halloumi slices and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your tomato ketchup, Henderson's Relish and cider vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your BBQ sauce


### Step 7
