## Description

Traditional risotto has been given a Gousto makeover. We've swapped the traditional arborio rice for spelt, an ancient healthy wholewheat, which gives the risotto a coarse, nutty texture. We use half of the Italian hard cheese to form delicious cheese crisps which sit atop.

## Ingredients

- 2 courgettes
- 1 tbsp shaoxing wine 
- 20g fresh basil
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 120g spelt
- 80g Italian hard cheese
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Peel and dice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic


Chop the courgettes into small pieces&nbsp;


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until it has started to soften


Meanwhile, boil a kettle


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add 3/4 of the courgette&nbsp;(you will use the rest later!)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;garlic and cook for 2 min&nbsp;


&nbsp;Meanwhile, dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 1L <span class="text-danger">[2L]</span> boiled water - this is your stock


### Step 4

Add the shoaxing wine and cook for 10 sec, then add the spelt and cook for 1 min&nbsp;


Add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring occasionally for 30-35 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the spelt is cooked


Tip: when checking if your spelt is cooked, taste it! It will remain course in texture and have a bite to it when cooked&nbsp;


### Step 5

Meanwhile, grate the Italian hard&nbsp;cheese&nbsp;


Line a baking tray with baking paper&nbsp;


Add half the grated cheese in 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> large circular mounds


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until the cheese&nbsp;has completely melted


Once melted, remove from the oven leave to cool for a few min until cool enough to handle, then carefully drape the melted cheese over a rolling pin and leave it to harden


&nbsp;


### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a separate, wide-based pan with a knob of butter&nbsp;over a medium heat


Once melted, add the remaining courgette with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until golden


Meanwhile, chop the basil, including the stalks&nbsp;


Once the spelt is cooked stir in the basil and remaining grated cheese - this is your speltotto

### Step 8

Serve the speltotto in bowls


Garnish with the golden courgette and cheese crisp


Enjoy!
