## Ingredients

- 80g natural yoghurt
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 100g salmon flakes
- 100g brown rice
- 3 white potatoes
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 10g parsley & dill
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tsp ground sumac
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the parsley & dill finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Combine the diced shallot and chopped herbs in a large bowl with the chopped garlic, salmon flakes, ground cumin and ground turmeric

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your salmon mixture


### Step 5

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, run the drained potatoes under cold running water until they're cool enough to handle

Return them to the pot, add a generous knob of butter and crush gently

Add the crushed potatoes to the salmon mixture and give everything a good mix up – this is your kofta mixture


### Step 6

Divide the kofta mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span>, then shape them into round balls – these are your salmon koftas

Add the salmon koftas to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Drizzle with olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the koftas are golden


### Step 7

While the koftas are cooking, slice the cucumber finely

Combine the sliced cucumber and the shredded red cabbage in a bowl with half the natural yoghurt, half the ground sumac (save the rest for later!), the white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac yoghurt slaw

### Step 8

Serve the salmon koftas with the brown rice and sumac yoghurt slaw to the side

Drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt and garnish with the remaining ground sumac

Enjoy!
