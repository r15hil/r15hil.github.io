## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Add your cherry tomatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until softened


### Step 2

While the tomatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 3

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your tomato paste and sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the garlic has softened

Once the garlic has softened, add the vegetable stock, roasted tomatoes (reserve the tray for later!), balsamic vinegar and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for a further 5-6 min until thickened – this is your roasted tomato sauce


### Step 6

While the sauce is thickening, increase the oven temperature to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your panko breadcrumbs and pine kernel & seed mix to the reserved tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together

Put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until everything is golden and crisp – this is your pine kernel & seed pangrattato

Tip: Watch it like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!


### Step 7

Meanwhile, roughly chop your basil, including the stalks

Add the roasted tomato sauce to the drained linguine with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted tomato linguine

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the roasted tomato linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with olive oil and a pinch of salt

Sprinkle the pine kernel & seed pangrattato over the roasted tomato linguine and garnish with the chopped basil

Enjoy!
