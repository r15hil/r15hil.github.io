## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix
- 80g fine green beans
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 160g diced sweet potato
- 320g British skin on chicken thighs
- 80g crème fraîche
- 100g brown rice
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then chop the green beans in half

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 2

Rinse the brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until later


### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, diced sweet potato and dried thyme and cook for 3-4 min further or until fragrant and starting to brown


### Step 5

Once starting to brown, add the chicken stock and halved green beans and cook, covered, for a final 10 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender


### Step 6

Once browned, turn the crispy chicken thighs and cook them for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and set aside to rest for a couple of min


### Step 7

Once the sweet potato is fork-tender, add the brown rice and half the crème fraîche (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your creamy sweet potato & green bean rice

### Step 8

Serve the crispy chicken over the creamy sweet potato & green bean rice

Dollop over the remaining crème fraîche and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
