Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, ground turmeric and ground cumin to the pan

Increase the heat to medium and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix and mango chutney in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water – this is your mango stock

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

While the rice is cooking, add the sliced portobello mushrooms to a tray and put it in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden

Garnish with the flaked almonds and roasted portobello mushroom slices

Enjoy!
