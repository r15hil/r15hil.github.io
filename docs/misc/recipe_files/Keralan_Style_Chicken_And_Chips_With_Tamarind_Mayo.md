## Ingredients

- 1  tbsp garam masala
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 1 red chilli
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 3 white potatoes
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 15g tamarind paste
- 1 cardamom pod
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 320g British skinless chicken thighs
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 25g cashew nuts

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips, then add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your chunky chips


### Step 2

Crush the cardamom pod<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>open by squashing it with the side of a knife

Add the garam masala and crushed cardamom pod<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to a large bowl with the ground turmeric

Add the ginger & garlic paste and chicken stock mix to the bowl along with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and stir everything together – this is your Keralan-style marinade


### Step 3

Add the chicken thighs to the marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your Keralan-style marinated chicken


### Step 4

Add the Keralan-style marinated chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Keralan-style chicken


### Step 5

While the chicken is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the cashew nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, transfer the toasted cashews to a large bowl


### Step 6

Cut the cucumber in to quarters lengthways, then chop into pieces

Add the chopped cucumber to the toasted cashews along with the white wine vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber & cashew salad


### Step 7

Combine the tamarind paste with the mayo in a small bowl – this is your tamarind mayo

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

### Step 8

Serve the Keralan-style chicken with the chunky chips, cucumber & cashew salad and tamarind mayo to the side

Garnish with sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
