### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 2

Add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your curry powder, a small pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the haddock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, flake the cooked haddock roughly with a fork and reserve the tray

### Step 3

While the fish is cooking, add your panko breadcrumbs and ground turmeric to a plate with a small pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and mix it all together

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, mash them until smooth

Add the flaked haddock to the mashed potatoes with half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Gently mix it all together – this is your fishcake mix

Press the fishcakes into the panko breadcrumb mixture firmly to evenly coat
