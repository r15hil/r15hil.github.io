## Ingredients

- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 1 red chilli
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 20g red Thai curry paste
- 2 x 110g skin on salmon fillets
- 25g red chilli relish
- 15ml soy sauce
- 100g brown rice
- 1 carrot
- 5g coriander
- 1/2 cucumber
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and rinse in a sieve under cold running water until completely cooled (leave in the sieve to drain fully!)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with the red Thai curry paste


### Step 3

Remove and discard the skin from the salmon fillets, then chop the salmon into small bite-sized cubes and add to the bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and use your hands to gently massage the mixture for 30 secs or until it comes together (clean hands is best!)

Tip: Don't squeeze the mixture too much, or this will release liquid and you want to keep the mixture dry


### Step 4

Divide the mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>, shape into thin patties and add to a plate

Put the patties in the fridge to firm up – these are your salmon fishcakes


### Step 5

Dice the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the grated carrot and diced cucumber to a bowl with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, the soy sauce and the chilli relish and give everything a good mix up

Chop the remaining lime into wedges


### Step 6

Heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the salmon fishcakes to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the salmon fishcakes are cooking, add the cooled brown rice and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil to the bowl with the cucumber and carrot, then give everything a good mix up – this is your Asian-style rice salad

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve your salmon fishcakes over the Asian-style rice salad

Garnish with the chopped coriander and lime wedges

Enjoy!
