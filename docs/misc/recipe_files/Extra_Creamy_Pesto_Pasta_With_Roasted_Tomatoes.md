### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Add your pine kernel & seed mix to a large pan over a medium heat and cook for 2-3 min, stirring occasionally, until nicely toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, transfer the toasted seeds to a food processor


### Step 2

While the pine kernels & seeds are toasting, chop your tomato[es] into wedges and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until softened – these are your roasted tomatoes


### Step 3

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for an initial 9 min

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Peel your garlic and add it to the food processor with your basil (chuck it in, stalks and all!), grated Italian hard cheese, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span>[4 tbsp] </span>cold water, your vegetable stock mix, soft cheese and the juice of half your lemon[s]

Blitz until well combined and smooth – this is your extra creamy pesto


### Step 5

Trim, then chop your green beans in half


### Step 6

Once the farfalle has been cooking for an initial 9 min, add the halved green beans to the pot and cook for 3-4 min further or until the farfalle is cooked through and the green beans are tender


### Step 7

Once cooked, drain the farfalle & green beans, then return them to the pot with the creamy pesto

Give everything a good mix up until fully coated – this is your extra creamy pesto pasta

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the extra creamy pesto pasta topped with the roasted tomatoes, season with a grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge
