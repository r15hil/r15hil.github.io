## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, cardamom pod[s] and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered


### Step 2

Add your diced chicken breast to a bowl with half your garam masala, half your curry powder and half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the marinated chicken to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) and place in the oven for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to char – this is your tandoori chicken


### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped garlic and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with a large knob of butter and mix it all together – this is your garlic & coriander butter


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

Once softened, add your ginger & garlic paste, remaining garam masala and remaining curry powder to the pan and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the remaining natural yoghurt, tandoori chicken (reserve the tray[s]) and remaining chopped coriander – this is your butter chicken curry


### Step 6

To make the perfect burrito, top each tortilla with some spinach, cardamom rice and butter chicken curry, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll your tortilla until you’re left with a burrito – these are your butter chicken breast burritos

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!


### Step 7

Add the butter chicken breast burritos to the reserved baking tray[s] and put in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp

Once browned, remove the tray[s] from the oven and spread the garlic & coriander butter over the burritos – these are your garlic & coriander butter chicken breast burritos

### Step 8

Slice the garlic & coriander butter chicken breast burritos in half and serve

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!
