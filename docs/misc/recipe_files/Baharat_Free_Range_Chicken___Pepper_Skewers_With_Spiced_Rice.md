### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into 6 pieces per person

Chop half your pepper[s] into bite-sized pieces, then chop half your red onion[s] into chunks (save the rest for later!)

Give everything a good mix up until nicely coated

### Step 3

Thread the chicken, pepper and onion chunks onto the skewers, alternating as you go – these are your chicken skewers

Transfer the chicken skewers to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your baharat free range chicken & pepper skewers
