### Step 1

Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat 

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once the lean pork mince is beginning to brown, crumble your chestnut mushrooms directly into the pan, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the mushrooms are starting to soften

### Step 6
