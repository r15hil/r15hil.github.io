## Ingredients

- Spinach (120g)
- Spinach (80g) x0
- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Mature cheddar style block (40g)
- Spring onion x2
- British free range egg x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle


### Step 2

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Add the chopped potatoes and garlic to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Reboil a kettle

Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can

Boil the kettle again (last time, we promise!)


### Step 4

Chop the wilted spinach roughly

Grate your cheddar flavour block

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 5

Place your smoked basa fillet[s] on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Drizzle them with a little olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Bring a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Crack your egg[s] gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel and season them with salt and pepper – this is your poached egg


### Step 7

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter alternative and a splash of milk alternative

Mash until smooth, then add the chopped spinach

Stir in the grated cheddar flavour block and sliced spring onion and season with salt and pepper – this is your cheezy spinach mash

### Step 8

Serve the smoked basa over the cheezy spinach mash and top with a poached egg and a generous crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
