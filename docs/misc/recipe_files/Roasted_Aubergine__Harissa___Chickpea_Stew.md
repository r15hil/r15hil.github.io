## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s], then chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min until the aubergine is soft and golden


### Step 2

While the aubergine is cooking, boil a full kettle

Dice your tomato[es]

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 5 min or until softened


### Step 4

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Drain and return to the pot

Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout to the pan with your tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the diced tomato, vegetable stock and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 5-10 min or until reduced to a thick sauce

Meanwhile, reboil a kettle, then drain and rinse your chickpeas

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained chickpeas and cook for a further 2-3 min or until combined – this is your harissa & chickpea stew


### Step 6

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour over the boiled water so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until cool

Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly, then add to the pot with the cooked bulgur wheat

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your spinach bulgur


### Step 7

Once the aubergine is soft and golden, push it to one side of the tray[s] and add your pine kernel & seed mix to the other side, then return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely (save some leaves for garnish!), discard the stems

Once the seeds are toasted, remove the tray[s] from the oven, then stir the roasted aubergine into the harissa & chickpea stew

### Step 8

Serve the roasted aubergine, harissa & chickpea stew with the spinach bulgur to the side

Garnish with the toasted pine kernel & seed mix, chopped mint and reserved mint leaves

Enjoy!
