## Ingredients

- 1 tomato
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 130g white long grain rice
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 30ml soy sauce
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1 orange
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 3 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down (reserve the pot!)


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Combine the juice of the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> cold water

Add the ground paprika and cornflour to the bowl and whisk everything together – this is your Filipino-style tocino sauce


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice (don't chop) the garlic

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Chop the cucumber into quarters lengthways, and then roughly chop


### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the Filipino-style tocino sauce to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to thicken


### Step 5

Drain the king prawns

Once the sauce is beginning to thicken, add the drained king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency – these are your Filipino-style sticky king prawns


### Step 6

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until softened and beginning to colour

Once softened, add the cooled rice and cook for 2-3 min – this is your garlic fried rice


### Step 7

Heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 8

Serve the Filipino-style sticky king prawns with the garlic fried rice, chopped cucumber and diced tomato to the side

Spoon any remaining Filipino-style tocino sauce from the pan over the top of the prawns

Top the rice with the fried egg

Enjoy!
