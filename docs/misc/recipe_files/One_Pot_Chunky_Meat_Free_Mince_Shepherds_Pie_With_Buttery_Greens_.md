### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min  to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based oven-proof casserole dish, with a matching lid with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 1/2 tbsp]</span> of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

### Step 5

Put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 30 min or until the potatoes are tender and everything's cooked through – this is your chunky meat-free mince shepherd's pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 6

After 30 min remove the lid from the dish and return it to the oven, uncovered, for a final 18-20 min or until the liquid has reduced and the potatoes are lightly coloured

Meanwhile, cut 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>piece of tin foil per person approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Wash, then add your shredded spring greens to the middle with a few small knobs of butter and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1636454686971-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a sealed parcel[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the greens are tender – these are your buttery greens

### Step 8

To serve, set the chunky meat-free mince shepherd's pie and buttery greens in the centre of the table, ready to share

Let everyone dig in!
