### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the diced carrot and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 3

Combine your cornflour and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add your chicken breast portion[s] and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

Boil a kettle

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Meanwhile, combine your honey, red chilli relish and 30ml <span class="text-purple">[45ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60ml] </span>cold water in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1686066955942-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Once the chicken is golden, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Add a couple of splashes of water and the sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1686066959511-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over to refresh them

Once the rice is cooked, add the refreshed peas, black sesame seeds and remaining soy sauce and mix everything together – this is your veg-packed rice

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1686066964352-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken with your toasted sesame seeds to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli chicken breast

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Serve the veg-packed rice with the sweet chilli chicken breast over the top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
