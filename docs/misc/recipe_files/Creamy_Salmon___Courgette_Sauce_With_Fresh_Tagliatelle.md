## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and shallot with a generous pinch of pepper and salt

Cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your double cream with your vegetable stock mix and 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> [250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock


### Step 5

Once slightly softened, add a knob of butter to the pan with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up

Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Add the creamy stock to the pan with your salmon flakes and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened


### Step 7

Add the drained tagliatelle to the sauce and stir everything together – this is your creamy salmon & courgette sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the creamy salmon & courgette sauce with fresh tagliatelle in a bowl

Season with a generous crack of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
