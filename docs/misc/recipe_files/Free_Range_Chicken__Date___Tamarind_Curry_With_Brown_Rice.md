### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice your red onion[s] finely

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add most of the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and caramelised

### Step 3

While the onion is cooking, rinse your brown rice and add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot with a knob of butter and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

### Step 5

Combine your chopped dates, tamarind paste, chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your date & tamarind stock

### Step 6

Add the ginger, turmeric, curry powder and a generous grind of black pepper to the softened onion and cook for 30 secs

Add the date & tamarind stock and give everything a good mix up

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook, covered, for 13-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1599839905627-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Dice your tomato[es] and cucumber

Combine the diced tomato, diced cucumber and remaining red onion in a large bowl with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Add the chopped coriander just before serving – this is your Indian-style salad

### Step 8

Remove the pan from the heat and shred the cooked chicken apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Give everything a good mix up – this is your free range chicken, date & tamarind curry

Serve the free range chicken, date & tamarind curry over the brown rice with the Indian-style salad to the side

Enjoy!
