### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)

Chop your courgette[s] into thick discs, approx. 2cm thick

Strip the leaves from your rosemary and discard the stalks

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the veg is soft and the potatoes are crisp
