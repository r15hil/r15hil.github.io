## Ingredients

- 0 British pork mince
- 0 chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 0 tomato paste
- 1 tomato
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 32g tomato paste
- 100g Greek salad cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 250g British pork mince
- 200g conchiglie
- 0 conchiglie
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your shallot[s] in half

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add the shallot halves, tomato wedges and chopped red pepper to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 20-22 min or until the veg is tender and the red pepper is slightly charred – this is your roasted veg


### Step 3

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), fennel seeds and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, divide into 5 per person and roll into meatballs – these are your pork meatballs


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until starting to brown all over


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the conchiglie, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 6

Reboil half a kettle

Once the veg is tender and slightly charred, add the roasted veg to the food processor with half your Greek cheese (save the rest for garnish!), your tomato paste, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[ 1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the remaining chopped garlic and chicken stock mix

Blitz until well combined and smooth – this is your Greek cheese & red pepper sauce


### Step 7

Once the meatballs are browned, add the Greek cheese & red pepper sauce to the pan with 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> [250ml] </span>boiled water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min further or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, add the drained conchiglie to the pan and give everything a good mix – these are your pork meatballs with Greek cheese & red pepper conchiglie

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the pork meatballs with Greek cheese & red pepper conchiglie and crumble the remaining Greek cheese on top

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
