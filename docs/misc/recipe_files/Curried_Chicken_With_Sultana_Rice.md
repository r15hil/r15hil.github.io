### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with a knife

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> [600ml]</span> boiled water and add your sultanas to soak

### Step 2

Heat a pot with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ground turmeric and crushed cardamom pods, and cook for 20 secs until sizzling, then add your basmati rice and chicken stock and increase the heat to high

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sultana rice

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim and slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add the grated carrot, sliced spring onion and your nigella seeds to a large mixing bowl and set aside – this is your Indian-style carrot slaw

### Step 4

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a bowl with your curry powder and a generous pinch of salt and mix until fully coated – this is your coated chicken

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid, then cook for a further 10-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your curried chicken

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from the stems and chop finely, discarding the stems

Cut your lemon[s] in half (save the rest for garnish!)

Tip: Watch out for the cardamom pods!

Garnish with a lemon wedge
