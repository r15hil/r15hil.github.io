### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your orange[s] in half, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the grated garlic, your ground cumin, dried oregano and chicken stock mix in a bowl, then add a squeeze of orange juice, half your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar and mix everything together – this is your carnitas seasoning

### Step 2

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish draining away half of the juices, then pour over the carnitas seasoning

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely

### Step 4

Add your chopped tomato, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), most of the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) and the juice of the remaining orange

Season with a pinch of salt and mix everything together – this is your salsa con jugo

### Step 5

Combine your mayo with the remaining chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a splash of the salsa con jugo liquid in a small bowl – this is your chipotle mayo

### Step 6

After an initial 30 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the pork apart using two forks and mix everything through the carnitas seasoning

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed and the pork has started to crisp a little – this is your pulled pork carnitas

### Step 7

Meanwhile, drain your sweetcorn

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a small pinch of salt and cook for 8-9 min or until charred – this is your charred corn

When the pork is almost ready, add your tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through

### Step 8

To assemble your tacos, divide the pulled pork carnitas, salsa con jugo and charred corn between the warmed tortillas

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and drizzle over the chipotle mayo

Enjoy!
