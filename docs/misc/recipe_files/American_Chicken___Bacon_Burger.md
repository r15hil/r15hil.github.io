## Ingredients

- 1 little gem lettuce
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 sweet potato
- 90g British dry cured streaky bacon
- 2 brioche rolls
- 1 large British chicken breast fillet
- 2 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1 spring onion
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard 
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 skewers

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the sweet potatoes (skins on) into chips


Add the chips to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Add the sliced spring onion, chopped garlic (Don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), natural&nbsp;yoghurt, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, a generous pinch of both salt&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;pepper&nbsp;&amp; a glug of vegetable oil to a small bowl&nbsp;


Give everything a good old mix up &ndash; this is your ranch sauce&nbsp;


### Step 3

Separate 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> outer little gem lettuce leaves and slice the remaining inner core&nbsp;into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>wedges


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat


Cut the brioche rolls in half


Once hot, add the brioche, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


Once hot, add the smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until&nbsp;starting to crisp


Once crisp, transfer the&nbsp;bacon to&nbsp;a plate with a few sheets of kitchen paper


Keep the pan and any oil in it until step 7!


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Meanwhile, place your hand flat&nbsp;onto&nbsp;the&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces of&nbsp;chicken


Combine the smoked paprika, cayenne pepper&nbsp;(Can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;black pepper&nbsp;and a very large pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;on a plate


Add the&nbsp;sliced&nbsp;chicken and mix to evenly coat in the spices


### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 3-4 min on each side pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through


&nbsp;

### Step 8

To serve, sandwich the&nbsp;spiced&nbsp;chicken, bacon and&nbsp;a dollop of ranch sauce in between&nbsp;the toasted brioche


Skewer to hold everything together


Serve the sweet potato chips&nbsp;and little gem wedges on the side, with the&nbsp;remaining ranch sauce drizzled over&nbsp;


Enjoy!
