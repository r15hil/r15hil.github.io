## Ingredients

- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Chives (5g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Leek

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your waxy potatoes to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up then put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your leek[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds then wash thoroughly to remove any grit


### Step 3

After the potatoes have had 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and crush them lightly with a fork

Pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper then add to the baking tray[s] along with the chopped leek, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the potatoes are tender

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 4

While the fish is cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>milk and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your milk stock

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chives finely


### Step 5

Add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter to a pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux


### Step 6

Add the milk stock to the roux gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat, add most of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) and season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your herby white sauce


### Step 7

Reboil the kettle

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Once the fish is cooked, add the refreshed peas to the baking tray[s] – this is your fish pie tray bake

### Step 8

Serve the fish pie tray bake and drizzle the herby white sauce over everything

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
