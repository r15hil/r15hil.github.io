## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the chopped aubergine and red onion wedges to the dish


### Step 4

Chop your flat white mushrooms into bite-sized chunks

Add the chopped mushrooms and your butternut squash cubes to the dish and season generously with salt and pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until very lightly browned


### Step 5

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Add your chopped tomatoes, dried basil and dried oregano to the dish

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 45 min or until the veg is tender and the sauce has thickened – this is your baked plant-based ratatouille


### Step 6

Once the plant-based ratatouille has been cooking for 10 min, reboil half a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with your saffron, a generous pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, making sure all the rice is submerged

Cover very tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your saffron rice


### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

To serve, remove the baked plant-based ratatouille from the oven and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Set the plant-based ratatouille in the centre of the table, ready to share

Tear your basil leaves all over the top and serve the saffron rice to the side

Let everyone dig in!
