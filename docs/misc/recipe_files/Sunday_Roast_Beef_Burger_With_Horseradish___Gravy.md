## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 11g beef stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 3 white potatoes
- 160g blanched peas
- 2 carrots
- 250g British beef mince
- 1 tbsp dried sage
- 20g horseradish cream
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges


### Step 2

Top, tail and peel the carrots, then chop them into thick batons

Finely dice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>brown<span class="text-danger"> </span>onion, then slice the remaining onion

Add the diced onion, beef mince and half of the dried sage (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> patties and refrigerate until later


### Step 3

Crush the garlic cloves by squashing them with the side of a knife (keep the skins on!)

Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the crushed garlic, remaining dried sage and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until golden and crispy – these are your herby roasties


### Step 4

While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Once the potatoes have had 10 min, add the carrot batons to one side of a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put in oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the Henderson's Relish

Once the onions have softened, add 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the beef stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy


### Step 6

While everything's cooking, combine the horseradish cream and mayo in a small bowl

Reboil half a kettle

Once the carrots have had an initial 10 min, add the beef patties to the other side of the tray and return the tray to the oven for a further 15 min or until the carrots are tender and the patties are cooked through


### Step 7

Once everything's nearly ready, put the ciabattas in the oven for 4-5 min or until they're warm and crusty, then carefully slice in half

Add the blanched peas to the reserved pot, cover them with boiling water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Tip: If the gravy has cooled down, warm it through over a low heat

### Step 8

To assemble your burgers, spread a little horseradish mayo over each warmed ciabatta base and lid, then sandwich a beef patty, some roasted carrots, and a generous drizzle of onion gravy between the base and lid

Serve the warmed peas with a knob of butter to the side along with the remaining roasted carrots, the herby roasties and any remaining onion gravy (for dipping!)

Enjoy!
