## Instructions


### Step 1

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and slice your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Add your ground cumin, ground coriander, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and add your tomato paste

Cook for a further 2 min or until the mince is browned all over

Add your basmati rice and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice cooked

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 6

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through the drained black beans and coriander stalks then cook for a further 2 min or until the beans are warmed through – this is your Mexican-style meat-free mince rice

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style meat-free mince rice topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!
