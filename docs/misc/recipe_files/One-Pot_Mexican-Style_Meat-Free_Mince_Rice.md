Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice cooked

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!
