### Step 1

Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold water

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked transfer them to a chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest until later
