### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork and any juices to an oven-proof dish

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped waxy potatoes to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min – these are your roast waxy potatoes

Give everything a good mix up and divide into 1 patty per person – this is your smoky stuffing

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred, set aside until serving

### Step 7

After an initial 30 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed and the pork has started to crisp

### Step 8

To build, fill your toasted brioche bun with the apple sauce, smoky stuffing, BBQ pulled pork, apple slaw and your crispy onions – this are your BBQ pulled pork hog roast sandwich
