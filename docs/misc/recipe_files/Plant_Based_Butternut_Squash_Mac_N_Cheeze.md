## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, the boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s], then peel and finely chop your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your butternut squash cubes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the butternut squash for an initial 5 min or until starting to soften

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once the butternut squash has softened, add your macaroni and cook both for 10 min further or until the butternut squash is fork-tender and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the macaroni and butternut squash in a colander

Meanwhile, chop your sun-dried tomatoes in half

Pick your basil leaves from their stalks and finely chop the stalks

Grate your cheddar flavour block


### Step 4

Carefully transfer the butternut squash from the colander into a food processor, leaving the macaroni in the colander

Add the softened onion & garlic to the food processor with your single creamy soy and blitz until you're left with a smooth sauce – this is your creamy butternut squash sauce


### Step 5

Return the drained macaroni to the pot over a medium-low heat and add the creamy butternut squash sauce with your vegetable stock mix, chopped basil stalks and grated cheddar flavour block and cook for 2-3 min until the sauce has thickened slightly


### Step 6

Add the mix to an oven-proof dish and top with your basil leaves

Sprinkle over your panko breadcrumbs and then add the halved sun-dried tomatoes and drizzle over a little olive oil

Tip: Push the sun-dried tomatoes into the pasta so they don't burn!

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – this is your butternut squash mac 'n' cheeze


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl

Give it a good mix up – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the butternut squash mac 'n' cheeze with the salad to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad

Enjoy!
