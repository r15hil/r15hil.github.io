Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 125ml<span class="text-purple"> [165ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[225ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Drain and rinse your black beans

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

While the beef is browning, stack your tortillas and slice them into triangles, then add the sliced tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 5

Once the beef has browned, add 2/3 of the diced red onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add half the chopped tomato (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with the chipotle stock, drained black beans and a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil 

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your chipotle beef mix

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 7

Combine the remaining diced red onion and remaining chopped tomato in a bowl with the chopped coriander, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato salsa

Once the tortillas have browned, divide into 1 pile per person, spoon over the chipotle beef mix and top with the grated cheese

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your chipotle beef nachos

### Step 8

Serve the chipotle beef nachos and garnish with the tomato salsa

Enjoy!
