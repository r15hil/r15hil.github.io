## Ingredients

- 5g basil
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 80g fine green beans
- 1 ciabatta roll
- 3 white potatoes
- 320g British chicken thighs
- 80g spinach
- 1 pot of Cornish clotted cream (40g)
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions

### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water - this is your chicken stock

### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min further

### Step 4

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Return the chicken thighs to the pan and add the chopped potatoes

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Chop the green beans in half

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

### Step 6

Once cooked, remove the chicken thighs from the pan and transfer to a clean board

Add the chopped basil, green beans and spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the beans are tender

Add the ciabatta slices to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're golden and crisp

### Step 7

Shred the cooked chicken apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once everything is tender, add the clotted cream to the pan with the shredded chicken

Give everything a good mix up and season with a very generous pinch of pepper – this is your basil chicken & green bean casserole

### Step 8

Serve the basil chicken & green bean casserole in bowls with the warmed ciabatta slices to the side

Enjoy!
