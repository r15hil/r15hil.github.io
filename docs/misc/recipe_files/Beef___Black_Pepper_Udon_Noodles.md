## Ingredients

- 250g British beef strips
- 400g udon noodle
- 15g ginger paste
- 1 carrot
- 2.5g cracked black pepper
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 30ml soy sauce
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over the highest heat

Once your pan is very hot, add the beef strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min exactly, to sear the outside, but prevent them from overcooking

Once browned, transfer the beef strips to a plate to rest (it’s okay if they’re a little pink on the inside, they’ll go back in the sauce later) and reserve the pan


### Step 2

Once the beef is browned, peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16] </span>wedges

Separate the onion wedges into petals

Top, tail and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into batons


### Step 3

Return the reserved pan (and any juices) to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the onion petals and carrot batons with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to char and soften

Tip: Add a splash more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 5

Once the veg has softened, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste and cracked black pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 2 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Add the udon noodles to the pan and gently separate them with a fork

Cook for 1 min further, then add the soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and a small splash of cold water

Cook for 2 min further or until everything's softened and warmed through


### Step 7

Meanwhile, slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Remove the pan from the heat and add the beef strips and any resting juices to the pan

Give everything a good mix up – these are your beef & black pepper udon noodles

### Step 8

Serve the beef & black pepper udon noodles

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
