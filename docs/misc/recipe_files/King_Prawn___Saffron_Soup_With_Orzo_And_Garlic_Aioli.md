## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 16g tomato paste
- 1 tomato
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 150g orzo
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 shallot
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 pinch of saffron

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, saffron and Chinese rice wine in 750ml <span class="text-danger">[1.5L]</span> boiled water – this is your saffron stock


### Step 4

Once the shallots are softened, add half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!), fennel seeds and chopped tomato to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the saffron stock, orzo and a very generous pinch of salt to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 8-11 min

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the mayo and remaining grated garlic in a small bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your garlic aioli


### Step 7

Drain and add the king prawns to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the orzo is tender – this is your king prawn & saffron soup

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn & saffron soup in bowls and top with the garlic aioli

Enjoy!
