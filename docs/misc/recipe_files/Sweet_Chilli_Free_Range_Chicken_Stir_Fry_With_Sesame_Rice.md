Add your white long grain rice and 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> [450ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving
