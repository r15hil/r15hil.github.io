### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

### Step 3

Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli roughly

### Step 4

Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped onion, sliced garlic and cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water with half your tamari soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), ginger paste, hoisin sauce and vegetable stock mix

Bring to the boil over a high heat and put the dish in the oven, uncovered, and cook for 20-25 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Chinese-style Fable mushroom

### Step 5

Reboil half a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 6

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces

Tip: Bash the cucumber in the bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Combine the bashed cucumber and remaining tamari soy sauce in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar – this is your bashed cucumber salad

### Step 7

Once the Chinese-style Fable mushroom is ready, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli

Give everything a good mix up and return the dish to the oven for 10 min or until the broccoli is tender – this is your oven baked Chinese-style Fable mushroom & broccoli

### Step 8

Serve the oven baked Chinese-style Fable mushroom & broccoli with the baked rice and smashed cucumber salad to the side
