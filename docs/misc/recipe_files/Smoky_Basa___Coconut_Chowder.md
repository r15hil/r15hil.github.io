## Description

Chowders can conjure up visions of hardy seafarers, battening down the hatches and tucking into bowls of hearty soup. Ours is a midweek version, with vegetables, thyme and smoky fish in a coconut broth. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.

## Ingredients

- Dried bay leaf
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Cornflour (1tbsp)
- Cornflour (1tsp) x0
- Garlic clove
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Carrot
- Thyme (5g)
- Brown onion
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]

Place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot and cook, covered, for 3-5 min or until beginning to soften and brown slightly

Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes


### Step 3

Reboil a full kettle

Add the chopped potatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 4-6 min

Whilst everything is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your thyme leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic, most of the chopped thyme (save some for garnish!) and your bay leaf[ves] to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Stir and cook for a further 1 min

Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water to the pan, cover, and bring to the boil


### Step 5

Add your smoked basa to the pan

Tip: Cooking for 4 or 5? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Cook, covered, for 6-8 min until your fish is cooked through, turning halfway

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While the fish is cooking, combine the softened creamed coconut with your cornflour and gradually stir in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water, mixing well to form a smooth paste – this is your creamed coconut mixture


### Step 7

Add the creamed coconut mixture to the pan (this will cause the liquid to thicken as it returns to the boil)

Break up the cooked basa with a wooden spoon as you go

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your smoky basa & coconut chowder

### Step 8

Serve the smoky basa & coconut chowder, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Garnish with the reserved chopped thyme

Enjoy!
