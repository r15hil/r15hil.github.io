Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

### Step 2

Chop your waxy potatoes in half lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, carrot discs, bay leaf[ves] and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: If your carrots are still a bit crunchy don't worry, these will be baked in the oven later!

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 4

Add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add your beef stock mix and tomato paste and stir to combine

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water with your wholegrain mustard, Henderson's Relish and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened and cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 5

Return the drained potatoes to a medium heat with a knob of butter, half the rosemary leaves (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Lightly crush the potatoes with a masher or fork and then give everything a good mix up – these are your rosemary potatoes

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!

### Step 6

Once the beef mixture has thickened, season with a grind of black pepper and discard the bay leaf[ves], transfer it to an oven-proof dish and reserve the pan

Top the beef mixture with the rosemary potatoes and sprinkle over the reserved rosemary leaves

Put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your hearty beef, carrot & mustard pie

### Step 7

Wash your spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Once the pie is almost done, wipe the reserved pan clean and add to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

### Step 8

Serve the hearty beef, carrot & mustard pie with the tender spring greens to the side

Enjoy!
