### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 9 min on each side pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Cajun-style free range chicken

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add your shredded red cabbage, grated carrot and half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your red cabbage slaw

Combine your mayo and red chilli relish in a bowl – this is your chilli mayo

### Step 7

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half, then add the ciabatta halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to use 2 trays!

### Step 8

To build your burger, spread the warmed ciabatta base with the chilli mayo and top with the Cajun-style free range chicken, some of the red cabbage slaw and top with the warmed ciabatta lid – this is your Cajun-style free range chicken burger

Serve the chips and remaining red cabbage slaw to the side and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
