## Ingredients

- 1 bag of fried onions (15g)
- 1 bag of roasted peanuts (25g)
- 1 red chilli
- 1 Sriracha hot chilli sauce sachet (8ml)
- 1 whole butternut squash
- 1 Thai red curry paste sachet (20g)
- 1 tamarind paste sachet (15g)
- 1 soy sauce sachet (30ml)
- 80g mangetout
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lime
- 100g Thai rice noodles

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice the whole butternut squash in half, then scoop out and discard the seeds

Tip: For easier cutting, use a bread knife (oiling the knife helps too!)


### Step 2

Slice each squash half into 1cm wedges and add them to a bowl with the Thai red curry paste, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and mix well

Put the marinated squash wedges onto a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and put the tray in the oven for 20-22 min or until cooked through but with a slight bite

Remove from the oven and set aside


### Step 3

Place the rice noodles into a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 15 min to soften

Once softened, drain the rice noodles and keep to one side


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Slice the mangetout in half diagonally

Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>finely


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Add the chopped garlic and half of the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min until starting to caramelise

Once caramelised, add the mangetout and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the soy sauce, Sriracha, tamarind paste, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime – this is your pad Thai sauce

Add the drained rice noodles and the pad Thai sauce to the pan, stirring until everything is evenly coated in the sauce


### Step 7

Remove the squash wedges from the baking tray and add to the pan, stir to combine for 1 min then turn off the heat and cover - this is your spicy squash pad Thai

Meanwhile, crush the peanuts in the bag with a rolling pin

Slice the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the spicy squash pad Thai with the crispy onions, sliced spring onion, remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and crushed peanuts on top

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
