## Ingredients

- 100g carrots
- 1 x 300g British baby gammon joint
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 50g diced apricots
- 100g parsnips
- 5g fresh sage
- 300g potatoes 
- 1 knob of fresh root ginger (15g)
- 100g Brussels sprouts

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Pat the baby gammon dry with kitchen paper


Heat a dry pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the gammon and cook all over until browned (seared) for approx. 5 min&nbsp;


Tip: use tongs for greater turning control&nbsp;


### Step 2

Transfer the browned&nbsp;gammon to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) keeping the pan for later


Season with plenty of pepper and place in the oven for 35-40 min or until cooked through and piping hot


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-size pieces


Peel and cut the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;and carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


Add the potatoes, parsnips and carrot to a separate baking tray, drizzle them with&nbsp;vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt


Place the tray in the oven for an initial 25 min or until everything's starting to crisp


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop the diced apricots up so they are finely chopped&nbsp;


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger&nbsp;


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil


Once hot, add the chopped&nbsp;ginger and chopped&nbsp;apricots and cook for 2-3 min


Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]&nbsp;</span>water and the honey&nbsp;then reduce the heat to very low and cook for a further 10-15 min or until you have a jammy, coarse chutney


Tip: mash the chutney with a fork to bind it together more


### Step 6

Meanwhile, separate the sage leaves from their stems and finely chop


Trim the tails off the Brussels&nbsp;sprouts&nbsp;


Tip: cut&nbsp;any larger sprouts in half so that they cook evenly


### Step 7

Add the sage and Brussels&nbsp;sprouts&nbsp;to the baking tray


Return the tray to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until everything is cooked through - this is your roast veg

### Step 8

Once cooked, transfer the gammon to a clean chopping board, cover it with a tea towel and leave it to rest for 5 min


Once rested, slice the gammon and serve it with the roast veg and&nbsp;chutney


Enjoy!
