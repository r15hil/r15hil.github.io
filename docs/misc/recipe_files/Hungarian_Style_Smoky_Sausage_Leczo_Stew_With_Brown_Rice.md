## Ingredients

- 65g brown long grain rice
- 5.5g chicken stock mix
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 16g tomato paste
- 2 tomatoes
- 32g tomato paste
- 2 Jolly Dog pork sausages
- 130g long grain brown rice
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 1 green pepper
- 5g parsley
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your hot dog sausage[s] and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until browned all over


### Step 2

Once browned, transfer the sausage[s] to a clean chopping board (reserve the pan!)

Cut narrow slices widthways (about the width of a pound coin) into the hot dog sausage[s], making sure not to cut all the way down to the base

Add the sliced hot dog sausage[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the sausage[s] is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 3

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, pepper strips and bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, tomato wedges and tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until the vegetables are tender and the stock has thickened to a stew-like consistency


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Once the sausage[s] is cooked through, add them to the pan with the stew with any remaining juices from the tray, discard the bay leaf[ves] – this is your Hungarian-style smoky sausage leczo stew

### Step 8

Serve the Hungarian-style smoky sausage leczo stew with the brown rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
