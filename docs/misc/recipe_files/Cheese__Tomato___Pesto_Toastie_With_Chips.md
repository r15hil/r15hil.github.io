## Ingredients

- Traditional Italian pesto (45g)
- Ciabatta x2
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Rocket (20g)
- Tomato x2
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the ciabatta base[s], cut-side up, to a baking tray (or two!) (set aside the lid[s] for later)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until lightly toasted, then remove from the oven and set aside


### Step 3

While the ciabatta is toasting, slice your tomato[es] finely


### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces then pat dry again with kitchen paper


### Step 5

To assemble, divide most of your traditional Italian pesto between the toasted ciabatta base[s] (you’ll use the rest later!)

Top with the sliced tomato and torn mozzarella

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 6

Return the tray[s] to the oven for an initial 5-6 min or until the mozzarella is slightly melted

Once the cheese is slightly melted, add the ciabatta lid[s], cut-side down, to the tray[s] next to the cheesy base[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the mozzarella is melted and lightly golden – this is your cheese, tomato & pesto base[s]


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the remaining pesto with your mayo and a pinch of pepper – this is your pesto mayo

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

To assemble, top the cheese, tomato & pesto base with a handful of salad and a toasted ciabatta lid – this is your cheese, tomato & pesto toastie

Serve the chips and pesto mayo to the side

Enjoy!
