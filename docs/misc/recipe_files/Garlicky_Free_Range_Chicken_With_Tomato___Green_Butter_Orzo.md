### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel the garlic and roughly tear the basil, including the stalks (reserve a couple of leaves for garnish!)

Add the peeled garlic, torn basil and a large knob of butter to a food processor and pulse until blitzed but not smooth – this is your basil butter

### Step 5

Place the chopped tomatoes evenly on top of the orzo, they should sink down under the stock

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper

Put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until the stock has been absorbed and the orzo is cooked – this is your tomato & green butter orzo

### Step 7

Whilst the orzo is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken breast and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Once slightly browned, add the remaining basil butter and red wine vinegar and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your garlicky chicken

### Step 8

Serve the garlicky free range chicken over the tomato & green butter orzo

Scatter over the reserved basil leaves and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
