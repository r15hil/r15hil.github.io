## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the dish with a pinch of salt

Give everything a stir for 2-3 min, breaking the pork mince up into rough, large pieces with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into discs

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges


### Step 5

Add the carrot discs and onion wedges to the dish with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, chilli flakes, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce, miso paste and ginger & garlic paste

Give everything a good mix up then add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

After the initial 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and add your udon noodles

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 5-7 min further or until the noodles are tender and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one-pot chilli & miso pork udon noodles

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 8

To serve, top the one-pot chilli & miso pork udon noodles with the sliced spring onion and crispy onions

Dig in!
