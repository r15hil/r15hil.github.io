### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

### Step 3

Whilst the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger, garlic and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your basil leaves, ground turmeric and black mustard seeds

Add a very generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan with the juice of half your lemon and the tomato wedges

Bring to the boil over a high heat and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

### Step 7

Top the sauce with the haddock bites, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the fish is cooked through – this is your fragrant haddock moilee

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant haddock moilee over the basmati rice

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
