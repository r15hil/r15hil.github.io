### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced shallot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans

### Step 3

Once the pepper has started to soften, add your ground cumin and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your chopped tomatoes to the pan with the drained black beans and your vegetable stock mix

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>cold water and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, grate your lighter cheese finely

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)

### Step 5

Once the sauce has thickened, add the chopped coriander stalks and stir together – this is your enchilada filling

Divide 3/4 of the enchilada filling (save the rest for later!) between your tortillas, covering only half of each tortilla

Roll up your tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas

### Step 6

Place the enchiladas in an oven-proof dish, with the seam face down

Top with the remaining enchilada filling and the grated lighter cheese

### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until the cheese is golden and melted — this is your cheesy baked veggie enchiladas

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy baked veggie enchiladas drizzled with your natural yoghurt

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!
