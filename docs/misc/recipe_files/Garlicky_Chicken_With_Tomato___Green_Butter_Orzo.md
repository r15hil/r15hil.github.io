## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel your garlic and roughly tear your basil, including the stalks (reserve a couple of leaves for garnish!)

Add the peeled garlic, torn basil and a large knob of butter to a food processor and pulse until blitzed but not smooth – this is your basil butter


### Step 2

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[650ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 3

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 4

Add your orzo, chicken stock and half of the basil butter (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt to an oven-proof dish and gently stir it all together


### Step 5

Place the halved cherry tomatoes evenly on top of the orzo, they should sink down under the stock

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper

Put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until the stock has been absorbed and the orzo is cooked – this is your tomato & green butter orzo


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Whilst the orzo is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until starting to brown

Once slightly browned, add the remaining basil butter and red wine vinegar and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your garlicky chicken

### Step 8

Serve the garlicky chicken over the tomato & green butter orzo

Scatter over the reserved basil leaves and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
