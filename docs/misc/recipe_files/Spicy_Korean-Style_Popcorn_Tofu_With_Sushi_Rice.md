### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and rice vinegar in a bowl with half your gluten free soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), your agave and sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy sauce

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] on the diagonal

### Step 4

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into cubes, then add to a bowl with the remaining gluten free soy sauce and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>cold water and give everything a good mix up

Once fully coated, add your cornflour to the bowl and mix it all together until fully coated

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 3-4 min on each side until golden and crispy – this is your crispy tofu

### Step 6

While the tofu is cooking, combine 1/2 tbsp per person of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>spicy sauce and your mayo in a bowl with your mooli slaw mix and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy slaw

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1678299400348-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the tofu is golden and crispy, transfer to kitchen paper and carefully pour away the oil (reserve the pan!)

Tip: You can use this oil again in another recipe!

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the remaining spicy sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the crispy tofu with your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy Korean-style popcorn tofu

### Step 8

Serve the spicy Korean-style popcorn tofu with the sushi rice and spicy slaw to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
