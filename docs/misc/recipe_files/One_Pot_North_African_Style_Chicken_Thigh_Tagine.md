## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your chicken thighs to the dish along with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>flour, a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 min or until starting to brown

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste and ras el hanout and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Wash your spinach, then shake off any excess water


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix, butternut squash cubes and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tagine


### Step 5

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

When the tagine has 10 min left, reboil half a kettle

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with your sultanas, a pinch of salt, a drizzle of olive oil and 200ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>[400ml] </span>boiled water, cover and set aside until all the liquid has been absorbed

Fluff your couscous with a fork before serving – this is your sultana couscous


### Step 7

Once the tagine is cooked, remove from the oven and stir through the spinach with your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt

Leave to stand, covered, for 5 min or until the spinach has wilted – this is your one-pot North African-style chicken thigh tagine

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot North African-style chicken thigh tagine with the sultana couscous to the side

Dig in!
