- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- British chicken breast portion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle & heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and reserve the pan

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 3

Preheat the grill to medium-high

Add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil a kettle


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Add the sliced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes to the pan and cook for 2-3 min

Add your flaked almonds to a baking tray and put the tray under the grill for 2-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly


### Step 6

Add your Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water to the pan with the sun-dried tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 7

Once boiling, remove the pan from heat and add the drained orecchiette, chopped wilted spinach and half your goats' cheese (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Give everything a gentle mix up until the cheese has melted and the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your goats' cheese & sun-dried tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the goats' cheese & sun-dried tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette and the chicken to the side

Crumble the remaining goats cheese over the top and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
