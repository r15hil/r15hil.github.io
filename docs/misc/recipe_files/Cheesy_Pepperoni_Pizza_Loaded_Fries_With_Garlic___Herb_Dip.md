- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Sweetcorn cobettes (2pcs)
- Basil (5g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Gem lettuce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 25-30 min or until the fries are golden and starting to crisp


### Step 2

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil and top with a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to another baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 4

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Add your mayo to a small bowl with the remaining chopped garlic, half of your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your garlic & herb dip


### Step 6

Once the fries are golden, push them into 1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Drizzle over the tomato sauce, then top with the remaining dried oregano, torn mozzarella, grated cheese and pepperoni slices

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 6-8 min or until the cheese has melted and the pepperoni is crispy

Once done, set aside for a few min to cool slightly – these are your cheesy pepperoni pizza loaded fries


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and tear into rough pieces

Once the corn is tender, stand them upright and slice the corn from the cobs using a sharp knife (be very careful!), then discard the cobs

Add the torn lettuce and sliced corn to a large bowl and toss it all together – this is your corn salad

### Step 8

Tear your basil leaves over the cheesy pepperoni pizza loaded fries and serve the corn salad to the side

Drizzle half of the garlic & herb dip over the salad and use the rest for dipping

Enjoy!
