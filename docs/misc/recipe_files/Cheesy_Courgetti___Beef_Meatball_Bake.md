![Step 1 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-1-1656259918370-x200.jpg)

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine your beef mince with half of the grated garlic (you’ll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

### Step 2

Divide the beef mince and shape into 3 meatballs per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan and any remaining oil for later (these will finish cooking in the oven later)

### Step 3

While the meatballs are browning, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the diced onion and remaining grated garlic and cook for 6-7 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

Tip: Add an extra drizzle of oil if the pan's looking a little dry

### Step 4

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> [350ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your dried oregano and tomato paste – this is your herby stock

Trim the end[s] of your courgette[s] keeping the stalk[s] intact

Without cutting through the stalk[s], carefully slice the trimmed courgette[s] into thin strips, lengthways (at approx. 5mm intervals)

Then, peel lengths of the sliced courgette[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>until you have a pile of 'courgetti'

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your chopped tomatoes, herby stock and half of your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

Meanwhile, chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add half of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and a very generous crack of black pepper

### Step 6

Roughly break your linguine up into thirds, add it to the pan along with the courgetti and mix everything together – this is your tomato & basil sauce

Add the tomato & basil sauce to an oven-proof dish with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and press down on the broken linguine so that it's submerged in the sauce

Place the browned meatballs on top and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your courgetti & beef meatball bake

### Step 7

While the meatballs are cooking, grate your lighter cheese

Remove the dish from the oven after 20 min and top with the grated cheese

Return the lighter cheesy courgetti & beef meatball bake to the oven and cook for a final 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Set the lighter cheesy courgetti & beef meatball bake in the centre of the table, ready to share

Serve the salad to the side, dressed with the remaining balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Enjoy!
