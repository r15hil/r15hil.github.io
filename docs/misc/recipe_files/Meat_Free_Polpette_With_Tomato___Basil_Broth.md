### Step 2

Combine your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) with the chopped basil stalks, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix until combined (clean hands is the best way), then roll into 3 polpette per person

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the polpette and cook for 2-3 min, turning occasionally until browned on all sides

Once browned, set aside on a plate (reserve the pan) – these are your meat-free polpette
