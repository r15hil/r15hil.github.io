### Step 1

Add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the lean beef mince and cook for 7-8 min or until crispy, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once crispy, add the ground cumin and cook for 2 min further – this is your  crispy cumin lean beef

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Add the natural yoghurt to a bowl with the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give it a good mix up – this is your chipotle yoghurt

### Step 5

Transfer the crispy cumin lean beef to a plate and set aside

Drain and rinse the black beans

Return the pan (and any oil left in the pan from the mince) to a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained black beans, smoked paprika and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – these are your smoky beans

### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Add the beef stock and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further

Remove the smoky beans from the heat and mash into a semi-smooth paste – these are your refried smoky beans

### Step 7

In a bowl, combine the juice of the remaining lime with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper

Add the shredded lettuce and diced tomato and give it a good mix up – this is your chopped salad

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

To assemble your burrito bowl, top the basmati rice with the crispy cumin lean beef and serve the chopped salad and refried smoky beans to the side

Drizzle over chipotle yoghurt, sprinkle with the grated cheese and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
