## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse your kidney beans


### Step 5

Once the onion and pepper have softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add your lean beef mince with your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and dried chilli flakes (cooking for kids? Skip the chilli!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until the lean beef mince is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 6

Once the lean beef is browned, add the tomato stock with the drained kidney beans and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min further or until the sauce is thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your chilli con carne


### Step 7

Grate your cheddar cheese

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the chilli con carne over the basmati rice

Top with the grated cheese, a dollop of natural yoghurt and the sliced spring onion and enjoy!
