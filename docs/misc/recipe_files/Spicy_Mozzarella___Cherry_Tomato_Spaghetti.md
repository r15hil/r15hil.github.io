## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle and preheat the grill to high

Chop half your cherry tomatoes in half

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and remaining whole cherry tomatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray under the grill until serving


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Peel and roughly slice (don't chop) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 4 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> [8 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs


### Step 5

Add the sliced garlic to the pan with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs

Remove the pan from the heat, and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water

Tip: Be careful when adding the water to the pan, it may splash!

Return the pan to the heat, sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and tear your parsley into the pan and stir it all together


### Step 6

Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with the juice of half your lemon[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry


### Step 7

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the spicy spaghetti topped with the grilled cherry tomatoes and the torn mozzarella – this is your spicy mozzarella & cherry tomato spaghetti

Sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with a lemon wedge

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
