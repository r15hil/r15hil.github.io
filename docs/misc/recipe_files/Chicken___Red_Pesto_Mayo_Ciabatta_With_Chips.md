## Ingredients

- 1 mayonnaise sachet (30ml)
- 2 ciabatta rolls 
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 x 125g British chicken breast fillets
- 45g sun-dried tomato nut pesto
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 50g rocket

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, sprinkle each chicken breast with the dried oregano and a pinch of salt


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden

Once golden add the chicken to one side of a baking tray (line with tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Combine half of the sun-dried tomato nut pesto with the mayonnaise – this is your pesto mayo


### Step 5

Combine the remaining pesto with a generous drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your pesto dressing


### Step 6

Place the ciabatta rolls in the oven for 3 min or until they're hot and crusty

Carefully slice them in half before serving


### Step 7

Once everything is ready, wash and pat the rocket dry with kitchen paper

Add half of the rocket to the pesto dressing and give it a good mix up

### Step 8

Assemble your ciabatta rolls with the oregano chicken, pesto mayo and the undressed rocket leaves

Serve the dressed rocket leaves and chips to the side

Enjoy!
