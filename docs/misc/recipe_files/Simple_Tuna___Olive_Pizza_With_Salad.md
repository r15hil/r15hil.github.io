## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a<span class="text-danger"> </span>large baking tray[s] in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Drain your tuna


### Step 4

Slice your black olives in half


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza bases

Top the pizzas with the torn mozzarella, drained tuna, halved olives and dried oregano


### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the cheese has melted and the pizza bases are crispy – these are your tuna & olive pizzas


### Step 7

Whilst the pizzas are cooking, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl  – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Enjoy!
