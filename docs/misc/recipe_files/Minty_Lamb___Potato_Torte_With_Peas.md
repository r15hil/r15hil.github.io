### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the sliced potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 8-10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 2

While the potatoes are in the microwave, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once the steamed potatoes are done, remove the cling film to allow them to cool

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the meat has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the diced onion and garlic with a pinch of sugar and salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has slightly softened

Boil a kettle

### Step 4

Once softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water with your beef stock mix, Henderson's Relish and mint sauce and mix it all together

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened to a gravy-like consistency and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your minty lamb mixture

### Step 5

While the sauce is thickening, add a layer of the steamed potatoes (save the rest for later!) to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, use individual dishes!

### Step 6

Top the layer of potatoes with the minty lamb mixture then finish with the remaining steamed potatoes, leaving gaps between the potato slices if possible

Top with a knob of butter, breaking it up over the potatoes, then season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your minty lamb & potato torte

### Step 7

Reboil a kettle

When the torte is almost ready, add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

### Step 8

Serve the minty lamb & potato torte with the refreshed peas to the side

Enjoy!
