- 250g British beef strips
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 280g cooked white long grain rice
- 0 curry powder
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add the diced pepper to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your beef stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water

Add your star anise and a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Once the pepper has softened, add your curry powder, garam masala, turmeric and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your beef strips and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown


### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 7

Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min further until thickened slightly – this is your coconutty beef curry

### Step 8

Serve the coconutty beef curry over the cooked rice

Tear over your coriander leaves

Tip: Watch out for the star anise and discard them!

Enjoy!
