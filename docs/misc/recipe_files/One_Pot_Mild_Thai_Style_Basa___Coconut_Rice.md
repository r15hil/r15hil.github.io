## Ingredients

- Crispy onions (15g)
- Basil (5g)
- Basa fillet x0
- White basmati rice (65g) x0
- Fish sauce (8ml)
- Thai green curry paste (40g)
- White basmati rice (130g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Solid creamed coconut (25g)
- Spring onion x2
- Red pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and most of the sliced spring onions (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan with your Thai green curry paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and fish sauce in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your basmati rice and coconut stock to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to low then cook, covered, for 10 min or until most of the stock has absorbed and the rice is almost cooked

Tip: Add a little water if the rice is not cooked or the mixture is too dry!


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the rice is almost cooked, top with your basa fillet[s] and season them with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook, covered, for 5 min or until the fish is cooked through and tender

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once done, transfer the cooked basa to a plate

Add most of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan and mix it all together – this is your one-pot Thai-style basa & coconut rice

### Step 8

Serve the cooked basa over the one-pot Thai-style basa & coconut rice

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil and sliced spring onion

Sprinkle over your crispy onions

Enjoy!
