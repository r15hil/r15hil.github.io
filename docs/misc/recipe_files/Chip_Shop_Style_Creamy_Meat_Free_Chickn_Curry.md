## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a large baking tray (cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a grind of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Add the diced onion to a small heat-proof bowl and cover with boiled water to soften for 5 min

Once softened, drain and return to the bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of sugar, a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water and set aside – this is your quick-pickled onion


### Step 3

While the onion is softening, dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>finely

Reserve a few coriander leaves for garnish

Chop the remaining coriander finely, including the stalks


### Step 4

Heat a medium sized pot over a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter

Once melted, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to the pot with your curry powder and vegetable stock mix and stir everything together with a wooden spoon until a thick paste forms

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Remove the pot from the heat and gradually whisk in your creamy single soy, a little at a time

Return the pot to a low heat and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, creamy sauce remains – this is your creamy curry sauce


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your meat-free chick'n into bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Add the meat-free chick'n and soy sauce to the creamy curry sauce, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min further or until warmed through – this is your chip shop-style creamy meat-free chick'n curry

Drain the quick-pickled onion, reserve the bowl

Return the drained quick-pickled onion to the reserved bowl with the diced tomato and chopped coriander and toss – this is your tomato & onion salad

### Step 8

Serve the chip shop-style creamy meat-free chick'n curry with the chips and tomato & onion salad to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
