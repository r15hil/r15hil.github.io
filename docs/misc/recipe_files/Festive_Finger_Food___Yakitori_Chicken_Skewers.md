<span class="text-highlight">Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</span>

Add the chopped chicken to a separate bowl with <span class="text-highlight">3/4</span> of the yakitori sauce (save the rest for dipping <span class="text-highlight">later)</span> stir well – this is your marinated chicken


### Step 5

Thread the marinated chicken equally across the soaked skewers and add them to a baking tray


Tip: use baking paper to avoid mess!

Pour any remaining chicken marinade over the skewers


Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the sauce has caramelised and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim, then finely slice the spring onions
