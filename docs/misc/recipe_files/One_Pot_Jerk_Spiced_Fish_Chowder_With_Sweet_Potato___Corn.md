- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Vegetable stock mix (11g)
- Jerk paste (24g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Green chilli
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel your potato[es] and sweet potato[es] and chop into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Once the onion is softened, add a knob of butter with the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the butter is melted

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[11/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min


### Step 4

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk with 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water  and the vegetable stock mix

Add the chopped potato & sweet potato with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then bring to boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-18 min or until the potatoes are tender

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it sticking!


### Step 5

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, add the drained sweetcorn, soft cheese and half your jerk paste (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your basa fillet[s] and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your chowder

Once cooked, break up the basa with a spoon into bite-sized pieces

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Combine the remaining jerk paste with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper in a heat-proof bowl and cook in the microwave for 30 secs or until the butter has melted – this is your jerk-spiced butter

### Step 8

Serve the chowder and drizzle over the jerk-spiced butter and sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your one pot jerk-spiced fish chowder

Serve the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!
