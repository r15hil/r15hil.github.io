## Ingredients

- Spring greens (150g)
- Mirin (15ml)
- White miso paste (30g)
- White miso paste (17g) x0
- Fresh root ginger (15g)
- Plain tofu (280g)
- Blanched edamame beans (160g)
- Garlic clove
- Black sesame seeds (5g)
- Soy sauce (8ml)
- Pak choi (200g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the drained tofu into cubes


### Step 2

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips and pat dry with kitchen paper

Wash, then cut the pak choi in half, separating the white base[s] and green tops

Cut the white base[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add your blanched edamame beans to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them, then run under cold water until cool


### Step 3

Add your white miso paste and mirin to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your miso glaze

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop your ginger into matchsticks

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the tofu cubes and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until browned all over and starting to crisp


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and chopped pak choi base and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to wilt


### Step 6

Drain the refreshed edamame beans, then add them to the pan with the pak choi tops, ginger matchsticks and sliced garlic and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant and everything is tender with a bite

Add your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up – these are your stir-fried ginger greens


### Step 7

Once the tofu has browned, add the miso glaze and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has coated the tofu and is starting to caramelise

Sprinkle over your black sesame seeds – this is your miso tofu

### Step 8

Serve the miso tofu with the stir-fried ginger greens to the side

Enjoy!
