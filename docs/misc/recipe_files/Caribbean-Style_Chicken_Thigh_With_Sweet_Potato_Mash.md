### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine the zest of your lime[s] with your panko breadcrumbs, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your Caribbean-style crumb

### Step 2

Add your chicken thighs to the bowl with the Caribbean-style crumb and toss to coat evenly

Transfer the chicken thighs to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and top evenly with any remaining crumb

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Caribbean-style chicken

### Step 3

Boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized chunks

### Step 4

Add the chopped sweet potato to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 5

While the sweet potato is cooking, dice your tomato[es]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, then separate the whites from the greens

### Step 6

Add the diced tomato and the spring onion whites to a bowl (save the spring onion greens for garnish) and season generously with salt and pepper

Cut the zested lime[s] in half

Add your mango chutney, a squeeze of lime juice and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 7

Return the drained sweet potato to a low heat with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt, then mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash

Cut the remaining zested lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the Caribbean-style chicken with the sweet potato mash and tomato salsa to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion greens and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
