## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and dried oregano in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Heat a pot over a medium heat

Add the creamy single soy to the pot and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to a white sauce-like consistency – this is your plant-based béchamel


### Step 4

Drain and rinse the green lentils

Once the garlic is fragrant, add the tomato stock, chopped tomatoes and drained green lentils and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened slightly – this is your lentil & mushroom ragù


### Step 5

While the sauce is thickening, grate the cheddar flavour block


### Step 6

Layer some of the lentil & mushroom ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with 2 lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta

Repeat this process twice until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets (you may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish)

Cover with the plant-based béchamel, top with the grated cheeze and a grind of black pepper, then cook in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked through


### Step 7

While the lasagne is cooking, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash the salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the lentil & mushroom lasagne with the salad to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad

Enjoy!
