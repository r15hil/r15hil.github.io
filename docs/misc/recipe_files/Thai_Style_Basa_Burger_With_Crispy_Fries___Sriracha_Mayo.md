### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a large baking tray

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Chop the basa fillet[s] in half widthways

Coat the chopped basa evenly in your red Thai curry paste

### Step 3

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Press the chopped basa into the flour firmly to evenly coat all over

Meanwhile, peel and dice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>shallot[s]

Finely slice the remaining shallot

### Step 4

Add the diced shallot to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy – this is your crispy shallot

Once crispy, transfer them to a small bowl or plate and reserve the pan

### Step 5

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s] and roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Add the grated carrot, chopped coriander and chopped roasted peanuts to the quick-pickled shallot and mix to combine – this is your quick-pickled Asian-style slaw

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

### Step 6

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche bun halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until coloured and charred on one side only

Once charred, remove and set aside until serving

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1-1649848206148-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa fillet[s], reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 2 min on each side or until cooked through and lightly crisp – this is your Thai-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

To assemble, add a little sriracha mayo to each charred brioche bun base and top with the Thai-style basa, crispy shallot, some of the quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and a charred brioche bun lid

Serve with the crispy fries, the remaining quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!
