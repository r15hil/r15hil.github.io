### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and cut half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>red onion[s] into wedges, then peel and finely dice the remaining onion

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges and chopped sweet potato with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is beginning to soften

### Step 4

Whilst the onion is softening, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Drain and rinse your black beans

### Step 5

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your ground cumin and ground smoked paprika to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the pepper strips, drained black beans and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and mix together until everything is coated in the spices

### Step 6

Add your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock mix with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Stir everything together and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the sweet potato has softened and the sauce has thickened – this is your smoky sweet potato and black bean stew

Whilst the stew is cooking, chop your tomato[es] roughly and chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Peel and cut your orange[s] in half, then roughly chop half

Add the chopped tomato, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), diced onion, half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and the chopped orange to a bowl with the juice of the remaining orange

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli-orange salsa

### Step 8

Serve the brown rice with the smoky sweet potato and black bean stew to the side

Top with the chilli-orange salsa and a dollop of your natural yoghurt

Sprinkle the remaining chopped coriander over the top

Enjoy!
