### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rip the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rough, bite-sized pieces, then add it to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy croutons

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Divide the salad between your plates, and top with the lighter buffalo chicken

Drizzle the ranch dressing all over and garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
