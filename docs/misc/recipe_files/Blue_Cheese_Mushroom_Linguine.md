Once hot, add the spring onion,&nbsp;garlic, panko breadcrumbs and&nbsp;the walnuts&nbsp;and cook for 2-3 min or until brown and crispy&nbsp;

Add the shaoxing&nbsp;wine and cook 1 min further


### Step 6

Add the&nbsp;reserved&nbsp;pasta water to the mushrooms


Crumble the blue cheese into the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has a creamy consistency, then set aside


Cut and juice half of the lemon straight into the pan&nbsp;


### Step 7

Meanwhile, finely chop the parsley, including the stalks&nbsp;
