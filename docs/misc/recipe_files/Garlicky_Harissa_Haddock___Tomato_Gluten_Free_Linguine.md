- Gluten free linguine (190g)
- Haddock bites (100g) x0
- Haddock bites (200g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 2

Cut your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add your gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for an initial 7-8 min

Tip: This will finish cooking in your sauce later!

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[70ml] </span>of starchy pasta water


### Step 4

Reboil half a kettle

Dissolve your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[70ml]</span> boiled water with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your harissa stock


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has slightly softened


### Step 6

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Once the garlic has slightly softened, increase the heat to medium-high add the haddock bites to the pan with the tomato wedges and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the fish begins to turn opaque


### Step 7

Once slightly opaque, add the drained linguine to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper, the harissa stock, reserved starchy pasta water and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mix up and increase the heat to high, then cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has slightly reduced and the fish is beginning to break up – this is your garlicky harissa haddock & tomato gluten free linguine

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the garlicky harissa haddock & tomato gluten free linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
