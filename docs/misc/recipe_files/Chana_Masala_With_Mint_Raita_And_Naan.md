### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 10-15 min until softened and caramelised

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish)

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

### Step 3

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 4

Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then roughly chop

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium, add your garam masala and ground turmeric and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the chopped ginger, coriander and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your tomato paste and cook for 1 min further

Add the vegetable stock, halved cherry tomatoes and drained chickpeas and cook for 10 min or until the liquid has reduced to a thick sauce

### Step 6

While the sauce is thickening, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your natural yoghurt and mint sauce with a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your mint raita

Once the sauce has thickened, stir the chopped spinach through the chickpea curry – this is your chana masala

### Step 8

Serve the chana masala with the warmed naan and mint raita to the side

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!
