Once the pepper and onion have softened, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock to the pan

Increase the heat to high and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened

Once the sauce has thickened, add your spinach and cook until wilted – this is your tomato sauce

### Step 6

While the sauce thickens, chop your wholemeal pitta[s] into triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 8-10 min or until the pitta is crunchy and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 7

Once the spinach has wilted, make 1 well per person in the tomato sauce and crack your egg[s] into it, then cook, covered for 2-3 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your spiced shakshuka

### Step 8

Serve the spiced shakshuka with the toasted pitta triangles to the side

Garnish with your pumpkin seeds and a grind of black pepper

Crumble over your feta

Enjoy!
