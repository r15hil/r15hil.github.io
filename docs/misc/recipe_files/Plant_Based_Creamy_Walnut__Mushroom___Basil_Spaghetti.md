## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Crush your walnuts lightly in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don’t lose any!)

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!


### Step 3

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter alternative over a high heat

Once hot, crumble your portobello mushroom[s] roughly into the pan with your hands

Add the chopped garlic and the crushed walnuts to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for<span class="text-danger"> </span>2-3 min or until the mushroom has started to soften


### Step 4

Whilst the mushroom is cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix with your Henderson's Relish in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your Henderson's stock

Once the mushroom has softened, add the Henderson's stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until the stock has slightly reduced


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti


### Step 6

Whilst the spaghetti is cooking, grate your mature cheddar-style block

Chop most of your basil roughly (save a few leaves for garnish!)


### Step 7

Once the stock has slightly reduced, add your single creamy soy and half your grated cheeze (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly thickened

Add the cooked spaghetti and chopped basil to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your plant-based creamy walnut, mushroom & basil spaghetti

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based creamy walnut, mushroom & basil spaghetti topped with the remaining grated cheeze

Garnish with the reserved chopped basil

Enjoy!
