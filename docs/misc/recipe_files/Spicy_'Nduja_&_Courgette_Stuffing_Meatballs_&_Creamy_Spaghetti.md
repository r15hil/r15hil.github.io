### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat, then once hot, add the 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once done, move the warmed 'Nduja and any remaining 'Nduja juices to a large bowl and reserve the pan (no need to clean!)

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add a drizzle of vegetable oil, the chopped onion, a knob of butter and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has softened

Add half the softened onion to the bowl of 'Nduja

Keep the remaining softened onion in the pan but remove the pan from the heat

### Step 3

Grate the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then add it to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, then twist the ball to squeeze out as much liquid as you can

Chop the dried cranberries and zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Add the grated courgette, chopped cranberries and lemon zest to the bowl with the 'Nduja

Add the smoked paprika, panko breadcrumbs, cornflour, a drizzle of vegetable oil, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water to the bowl with the 'Nduja

Give everything a good mix up and press together firmly to shape into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> balls – these are your spicy 'Nduja & courgette stuffing balls

Add the spicy 'Nduja & courgette stuffing balls to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and put the tray in the oven for 17-19 min or until golden & crispy
