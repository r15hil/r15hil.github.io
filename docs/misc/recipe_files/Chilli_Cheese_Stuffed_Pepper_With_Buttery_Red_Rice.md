## Ingredients

- 150g canned sweetcorn
- 0 tomato paste
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 0 white long grain rice
- 2 sweet pointed peppers
- 32g tomato paste
- 0 cornflour
- 1 tbsp cornflour 
- 100g Greek salad cheese
- 130g white long grain rice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 0 vegetable stock mix
- 1 green chilli
- 20g chipotle paste
- 5g coriander
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the stem off your sweet pointed pepper[s] and deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) then cut a slit down the middle, lengthways (don't cut the whole way through!)

Add the cut pepper[s] to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side down, with a little drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 15 min


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large pot with a small knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, tomato paste and ground cumin and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and give everything a good mix up until the rice is fully coated


### Step 3

Once the rice is fully coated, add 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Drain your sweetcorn, then crumble your Greek cheese into small bite-sized pieces in a bowl

Add the chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the drained sweetcorn (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the cornflour and chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek cheese filling


### Step 5

After the initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Flip the pepper[s] over and stuff with the Greek cheese filling (be careful, it will be hot!)

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 10 min further or until the filling is slightly charred and the pepper is completely softened – this is your chilli cheese-stuffed pepper[s]


### Step 6

While the pepper is cooking, save some coriander leaves for garnish, then chop the remaining coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped coriander and natural yoghurt in a small bowl with a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander yoghurt


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add your vegetable stock mix and remaining sweetcorn and mix it all together – this is your buttery red rice

### Step 8

Serve the buttery red rice with the chilli cheese-stuffed pepper on top

Drizzle over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
