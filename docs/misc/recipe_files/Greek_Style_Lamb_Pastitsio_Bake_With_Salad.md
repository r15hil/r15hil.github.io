### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Add your lamb mince and cook for 4-5 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

### Step 3

Add the diced onion and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 7-8 min further or until the onion has softened

Once softened, add your ground cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Only add a little!) and dried oregano and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

When fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your lamb ragù

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and rinse under cold water and set aside for later

Tip: This will get rid of the starch and will stop the pasta sticking together!

### Step 5

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil to a separate pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce

### Step 6

Add the cooked tortiglioni to the lamb ragù and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek-style lamb pasta

Add the Greek-style lamb pasta to an oven-proof dish and top with the béchamel sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese over the top and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden brown and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek-style lamb pastitsio bake

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/1674.-step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Combine your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your dressed salad

Once golden, remove the Greek-style lamb pastitsio bake from the oven and allow to cool slightly

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style lamb pastitsio bake with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
