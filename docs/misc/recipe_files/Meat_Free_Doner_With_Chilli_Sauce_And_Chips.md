- Gem lettuce
- Tomato
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and grate half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>red onion[s]

Peel and finely slice the remaining red onion and set aside for later


### Step 3

Add your meat-free mince to a bowl with your ground cumin, dried oregano, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the grated red onion

Add a pinch of salt and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Cut two A3 size sheets of non-stick baking paper


### Step 4

Put the meat-free mince mixture between the two sheets and using a rolling pin, roll it out until approx. the thickness of a pound coin, then peel off the top baking sheet and transfer the rolled meat-free mince to a large baking tray (or two!)

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Do this in batches!

Drizzle the rolled meat-free mince with olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until cooked through and browned


### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

Cut your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Combine the remaining chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) to a bowl with your mayo, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your garlic mayo


### Step 6

Add your tomato ketchup to a separate bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Give it a good mix up – this is your chilli sauce

Once the chips are almost done, push them to one side, then add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the tray[s] and return to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


### Step 7

Once the meat-free mince has browned, transfer it to a clean board and slice into long strips – this is your meat-free doner

### Step 8

Top the warmed pitta with the shredded lettuce, meat-free doner meat, sliced red onion and tomato wedges

Drizzle over the garlic mayo and chilli sauce (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and serve the chips and remaining garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
