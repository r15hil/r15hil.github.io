### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Tip: This is just to warm your naans later (alternatively, just pop them in the toaster)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through, then transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 2

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the ginger & garlic paste, cumin seeds, and half of the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the Mediterranean veg mix, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and cook, covered, for 4 min or until starting to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the plain naans to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot (or add to your toaster!)

In a small bowl, combine the Greek-style yoghurt and the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your harissa yoghurt

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 4

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Once the veg has started to soften, return the cooked prawns to the pan

Add the juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and a generous pinch of salt and pepper<span class="text-danger"> </span>and give everything a good mix up – these are your harissa & ginger prawns

Cut the warmed naan into strips

### Step 5

Spread the harissa yoghurt on the plate and top with the harissa & ginger prawns

Serve the naan strips and salad to the side

Garnish everything with the ground sumac

Enjoy!
