## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar 
- 250g British beef mince
- 75g fragrant basmati rice
- 2 tbsp smoky chipotle paste
- 10g fresh coriander
- 2 tbsp rich tomato paste
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 100g British mini cooking chorizo

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


&nbsp;


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the sliced&nbsp;pepper and sliced&nbsp;onion with a generous pinch of salt,&nbsp;pepper&nbsp;and&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;and cook for 10 min, or until everything has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 175ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut each&nbsp;tortilla&nbsp;into three so you are left with large tortilla shards&nbsp;


Tip: stack them up before cutting to speed up the process!


Add the tortilla shards to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with olive oil, season with a pinch of salt&nbsp;and put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until they're crispy


Tip: you may need to do this in batches!&nbsp;


### Step 5

Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Cut the mini chorizo sausages in half&nbsp;


Dissolve the tomato paste in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water&nbsp;- this is your tomato stock


Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges&nbsp;


### Step 6

Once the pepper&nbsp;and&nbsp;onion&nbsp;have softened, transfer them to a plate and set aside


Return the pan to a high heat and once hot, add the chorizo and beef mince&nbsp;


Cook for 4 min or until browned, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon as you go


Once browned, return the pepper&nbsp;and onion to the pan with the&nbsp;smoked paprika and chipotle paste and cook for 1 min


### Step 7

Add the tomato stock to the pan with a generous pinch of salt&nbsp; and pepper and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until thickened to a chilli-like consistency&nbsp;


Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Grate the cheddar cheese&nbsp;


Squeeze the juice of half the lime wedges into the cooked&nbsp;basmati rice and season with a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;- this is your lime rice

### Step 8

Serve the beef and chorizo&nbsp;chilli over the lime&nbsp;rice


Top with the grated cheese and chopped coriander&nbsp;


Garnish with a wedge of lime&nbsp;


Serve the crispy tortilla shards in the middle of the table for sharing&nbsp;


Enjoy!&nbsp;
