### Step 2

Add the cornflour to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Coat the beef strips in the cornflour

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated beef strips and cook for 2-3 min or until browned

### Step 3

Once browned, add the onion wedges, chopped pepper and ground paprika and cook for 2-3 min

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water and stir in the tomato paste and Henderson's Relish – this is your beef stock

### Step 5

While the goulash is cooking, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Tip: If you'd rather skin-off mash, peel the potatoes first

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 7

Once the goulash is nearly done, return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Serve the warming beef goulash with the mash to the side

Garnish the goulash with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
