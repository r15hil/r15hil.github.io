### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pierce the red potatoes with a fork, then add them to a plate and cook in the microwave for 10-12 min or until cooked through

### Step 2

Chop the meat-free sausages in half

Add the halved meat-free sausages to a lightly oiled tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through and browned

Tip: Make sure the pieces have space between them!

Once cooked, set aside and reserve the tray

Top, tail, peel and dice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Grate the cheddar cheese

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, diced carrot and chopped garlic and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Boil half a kettle

### Step 5

Once the potatoes are cooked through, carefully slice them in half (they will be very hot!) and scoop the flesh out into a large bowl, leaving a little around the edges of the skin

Combine the potato flesh with the sliced spring onion, half of the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a knob of butter and mash it all together with a fork – this is your cheesy chipotle filling

### Step 6

Transfer the potato skins to the reserved baking tray and divide the cheesy chipotle filling between them, then top with the remaining grated cheese and drizzle with some olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until golden brown – these are your cheesy potato skins

Wash the lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1-1665136881114-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the onion and carrot have softened, increase the heat to medium-high, then add the smoked paprika, ground cumin and tomato paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and the baked beans and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add the cooked meat-free sausages to the pan, and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened – these are your meat-free bangers & beans

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free bangers & beans with the cheesy potato skins and lamb's lettuce to the side

Dollop over the natural yoghurt and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Drizzle some olive oil over the lamb's lettuce

Enjoy!
