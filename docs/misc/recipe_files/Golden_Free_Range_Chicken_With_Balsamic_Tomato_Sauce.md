## Ingredients

- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Basil (10g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Basil (5g) x0
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Garlic clove x2
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Baby plum tomatoes (125g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Shallot
- White potato x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish)


### Step 2

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 3

Reboil half a kettle and add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic and baby plum tomatoes with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until softened


### Step 4

Once softened, add your tomato paste and chicken stock mix with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Add the balsamic vinegar and dried oregano and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly

Once the sauce has thickened, press down on the baby plum tomatoes to release the juice (this can be quickly reheated before serving) – this is your balsamic tomato sauce


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 6

Coat the butterflied chicken in the flour, pressing firmly to coat them evenly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4 min on each side or until golden, then turn the heat down to medium and add a knob of butter and cook for a further 3-4 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, return the potatoes to a low heat with a generous knob of butter, a splash of milk and the chopped basil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your basil mash

### Step 8

Serve the golden free range chicken over the basil mash with the balsamic tomato sauce drizzled over the top

Garnish with the remaining basil leaves

Season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
