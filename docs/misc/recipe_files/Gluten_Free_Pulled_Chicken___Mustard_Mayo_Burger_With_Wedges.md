## Ingredients

- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- British chicken breast portion x0
- Gluten free brioche buns (2pcs)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Gem lettuces (2pcs) x0
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Tomato
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and mayo in a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your mustard mayo


### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Cut 1 slice of tomato per person, then dice the remaining tomato

Combine your white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your salad dressing


### Step 6

Once the chicken is done, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Season the pulled chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 7

Add your shredded lettuce and diced tomato to the bowl with the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Top each toasted brioche base with a dollop of mustard mayo, some pulled chicken and a tomato slice, then finish with the toasted brioche lid

Serve the dressed salad and potato wedges to the side

Enjoy!
