### Step 1

Before you start cooking, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, transfer the toasted seeds to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 3

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast strips and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cooked chicken

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Combine your mayo and balsamic sun-dried tomato paste in a large bowl with your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato dressing

Transfer some of the dressing (2 tbsp per person!) to a small bowl and set aside for a garnish

### Step 5

Chop your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Once the quinoa is nearly ready, add your shredded kale to the pot and cook for a final 1-2 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and rinse your cooked kale and quinoa under cold running water for 5 secs or until slightly cooled

Shake off any excess water and set the sieve over your pot to drain completely

### Step 7

When the chicken is nearly ready, add the tomato wedges and salad to the large bowl with the dressing and add the cooked kale and quinoa

Add a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your kale and quinoa salad

### Step 8

Top the kale and quinoa salad with the cooked chicken and the reserved dressing

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds, the cheese shavings and a grind of pepper – this is your chicken grain bowl with creamy sun-dried tomato dressing

Enjoy!
