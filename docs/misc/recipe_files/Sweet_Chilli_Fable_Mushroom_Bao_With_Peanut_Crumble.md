## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your cucumber into discs on the diagonal

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for a garnish!)


### Step 3

Combine your rice vinegar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl, then add the cucumber matchsticks, grated carrot and chopped coriander – this is your quick-pickled salad

Bash your Fable pulled mushrooms with a rolling pin to flatten them


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the bashed Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until browned


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your peanuts very finely – this is your peanut crumble

Combine your tamarind paste and vegan mayo in a bowl – this is your tamarind mayo


### Step 6

Combine your cornflour and red chilli relish in a bowl with the juice of half your lime[s] and your soy sauce  – this is your sweet chilli sauce

Once the fable mushrooms are browned, add your sweet chilli sauce with a small splash of cold water and cook for 2-3 min or until the fable mushrooms are glazed and sticky – these are your sweet chilli fable mushrooms


### Step 7

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with a little quick-pickled salad and the sweet chilli fable mushrooms

Sprinkle over the peanut crumble

Serve the chips and lime wedge to the side with the tamarind mayo and the remaining quick-pickled salad and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
