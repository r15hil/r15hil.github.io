## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help cool down


### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, diced carrot, chopped garlic and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for<span class="text-danger"> </span>5-6 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until softened


### Step 4

Combine your remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), fish sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Add a squeeze of your lime juice and give everything a good mix up – this is your prik nam pla

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person


### Step 5

Slice your cucumber finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 6

Once softened, add the cooled rice, your crab meat and soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined

Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your Thai-style crab & egg fried rice


### Step 7

Add the prik nam pla to your Thai-style crab fried rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai-style crab & egg fried rice with prik nam pla

### Step 8

Serve your Thai-style crab & egg fried rice with prik nam pla with the sliced cucumber to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, a lime wedge and your crispy onions

Enjoy!
