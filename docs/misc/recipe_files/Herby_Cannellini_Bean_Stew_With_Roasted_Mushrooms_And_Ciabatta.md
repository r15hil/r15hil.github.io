### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Strip the rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the rosemary sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

### Step 5

Add the drained cannellini beans, chopped rosemary and half the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min until fragrant, then add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for a further 1 min

Add the creamy stock to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until the vegetables are tender and the stock has thickened to a stew-like consistency – this is your herby cannellini bean stew

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Grind the chopped basil and remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: No pestle and mortar? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

Carefully slice them in half before serving

Wash, the spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper 


Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to the herby cannellini bean stew and cook for 3-4 min or until the spring greens are tender with a bite

### Step 8

Enjoy!
