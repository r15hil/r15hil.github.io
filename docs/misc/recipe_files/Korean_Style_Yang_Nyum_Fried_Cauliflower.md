### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, cut your cauliflower into small florets and add to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and your soy sauce

Give everything a good mix up so the cauliflower is fully coated

Add your cornflour to a separate bowl

Add the cauliflower to the bowl of cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the cauliflower is fully coated

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated cauliflower and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy – this is your crispy cauliflower

Tip: You might need to do this in batches!

Once crispy, transfer to kitchen paper and reserve the pan

### Step 5

While the cauliflower is cooking, combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar, tomato ketchup, honey and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your yang-nyum sauce

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1628679839504-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine 1/2 tsp per person of the yang-nyum sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with your mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a separate bowl – this is your creamy Korean-style dressing

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1628679846962-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the cauliflower is done, carefully pour away the oil

Tip: Store it in a glass jar and you can use this oil again for frying!

Return the pan to a medium heat, then once hot, add the chopped garlic and remaining yang-nyum sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the crispy cauliflower with your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your Korean-style yang-nyum fried cauliflower

### Step 8

Combine the grated carrot and shredded lettuce – this is your salad

Serve the Korean yang-nyum fried cauliflower with the cooked sushi rice and salad to the side

Garnish the cauliflower with the sliced spring onion and drizzle the creamy Korean-style dressing over the salad

Enjoy
