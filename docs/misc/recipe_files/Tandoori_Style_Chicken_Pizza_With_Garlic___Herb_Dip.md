## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Slice your chicken breast strips into thin strips, then cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice finely


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the chicken strips, pepper slices, curry powder, ground paprika, ground turmeric, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tandoori-style chicken & peppers


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add most of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with your tomato paste, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper

Add 5<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> water and give it a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce


### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the pizza base[s]

Top the pizza[s] with the tandoori-style chicken & peppers


### Step 6

Top the pizza with the grated cheese and then put the tray[s] into the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crispy – this is your tandoori-style chicken pizza


### Step 7

While the pizza is cooking, combine the remaining chopped garlic with your mayo, dried oregano, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your garlic & herb dip

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori-style chicken pizza with the garlic & herb dip to the side

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
