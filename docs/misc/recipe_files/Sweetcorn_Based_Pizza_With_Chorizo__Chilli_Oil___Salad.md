## Ingredients

- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Spring onion
- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Coriander (5g)
- Garlic clove
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small heatproof bowl with a pinch of salt

Heat a pot with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat for 1-2 min or until very hot

Once hot, carefully pour the heated oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later, reserving the pot – this is your chilli oil


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 3

Reheat the reserved pot with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sweetcorn is tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once tender, add the sweetcorn to a food processor with a splash of milk and a generous grind of black pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your sweetcorn purée


### Step 6

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add the pizza bases

Divide the sweetcorn purée between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with your diced chorizo and torn mozzarella and return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your chorizo & sweetcorn pizzas


### Step 7

While the pizzas are cooking, strip your coriander leaves from their stalks, discard the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo & sweetcorn pizzas with the salad to the side

Garnish the pizzas with the coriander leaves, sliced spring onion and chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Drizzle the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil

Enjoy!
