## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board, cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness


### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the flattened chicken to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need 2 pans!

While the chicken is cooking, chop your waxy potatoes in half and add them to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine 3/4 of your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and your mayo in a small bowl

Add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1/4 of your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a generous grind of pepper and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your hot honey ranch


### Step 5

Wash then remove leaves (1 per person!) from your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and set aside

Chop the inner core into quarters, lengthways

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar and remaining honey with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing


### Step 6

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add your brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Set aside until serving


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add a knob of butter with the remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – these are your garlic butter potatoes

### Step 8

To build the burger, top the warmed brioche base with an outer lettuce leaf, a few tomato slices, the cooked chicken, a generous dollop of the hot honey ranch and a warmed brioche lid – this is your hot honey ranch chicken burger

Serve the lettuce wedges and drizzle over the salad dressing with the garlic butter potatoes and any remaining hot honey ranch to the side

Enjoy!
