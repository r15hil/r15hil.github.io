Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp

Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 7

Add the drained gnocchi to the pan with a small splash of starchy cooking water and the chopped basil

Season with a grind of pepper, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the gnocchi – this is your tomato & bacon gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Drizzle some olive oil over the salad and season with a grind of pepper

Serve the tomato & bacon gnocchi with the salad to the side

Enjoy!
