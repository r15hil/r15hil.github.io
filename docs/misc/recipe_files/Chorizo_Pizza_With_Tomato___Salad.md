### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 2

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp [<span class="text-purple">7 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

### Step 6

### Step 7

Whilst the pizza is cooking, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your vinaigrette

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo pizza with a handful of salad and the remaining halved tomatoes to the side

Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad and cherry tomatoes

Enjoy!
