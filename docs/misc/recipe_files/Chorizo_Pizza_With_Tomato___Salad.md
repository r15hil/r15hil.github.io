## Ingredients

- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Plain naan (2pcs)
- Tomato paste (16g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Tomato paste (32g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp [<span class="text-purple">7 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 3

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your naan[s]

Divide the tomato sauce between the naan[s] and spread it evenly all over them


### Step 6

Top each naan with the torn mozzarella, diced chorizo and half of the halved tomatoes (save the rest for later!)

Sprinkle over your dried oregano

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the chorizo is cooked through – these are your chorizo pizzas


### Step 7

Whilst the pizza is cooking, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your vinaigrette

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo pizza with a handful of salad and the remaining halved tomatoes to the side

Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad and cherry tomatoes

Enjoy!
