## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 3

Combine your mayo with half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!), a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your lemon aioli

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped


### Step 5

Once crisped, add the diced onion and pepper strips to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 6

Once softened, add the remaining chopped garlic to the pan with your ground smoked paprika and tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your orzo and stir to coat the grains in the spices, then add the chicken stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking!)


### Step 7

Once cooked, stir through your blanched peas and cook for a further 1 min or until warmed through – this is your Spanish-style chorizo orzo
