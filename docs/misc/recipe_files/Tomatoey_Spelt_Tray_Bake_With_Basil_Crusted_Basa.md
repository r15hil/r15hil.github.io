Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Deseed the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Crush 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> garlic cloves open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skins

### Step 2

### Step 3

Add the chopped yellow pepper, crushed garlic and spelt to an oven-proof dish

Pour over the tomato stock, add a generous grind of pepper and cover with tin foil

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min – this is your tomatoey spelt tray bake

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Grind the chopped basil and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely and mix with the oil

### Step 6

After the tomatoey spelt tray bake has had 30 min, remove the dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper, lay them on top of the spelt and top them with the basil breadcrumbs

Return the dish to the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily
