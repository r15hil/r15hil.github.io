## Ingredients

- 1 mango
- 1 red chilli
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 185g canned chickpeas
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 15g tamarind paste
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 5g coriander
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Add the drained chickpeas to a baking tray with the ground coriander, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy chickpeas


### Step 2

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed and chop finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger and coriander with the rice vinegar, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your chilli dressing


### Step 3

Top, tail and peel the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Stand the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Slice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 4

Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges, then separate the wedges into 'petals'

Cut the chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until lightly browned

Once lightly browned, add the onion petals and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion has softened


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, add the tamarind paste to the pan with a small splash of water

Remove the pan from the heat and stir it all together until everything's coated in the tamarind sauce


### Step 7

Wash the baby leaf salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad, cooked chicken, red onion petals, sliced mango and chilli dressing to a large bowl

Gently mix together – this is your chicken & mango salad

### Step 8

Serve the chicken & mango salad with the crispy chickpeas over the top

Enjoy!
