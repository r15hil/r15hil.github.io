### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your red onions into wedges

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add your butternut squash cubes and cook for a further 2-3 min

### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your vegetable stock

### Step 4

Add the chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your red Thai curry paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock, and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the sauce has reduced and the vegetables are tender

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 6

While the rice is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (keeping the leaves and stalks separate!)

Chop your roasted peanuts roughly

### Step 7

Once the vegetables are tender, add the coriander stalks to the pan

Add your cultured coconut and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan – this is your Thai-style butternut squash & coconut curry

Cut the remaining lime[s] into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style butternut squash & coconut curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped peanuts, reserved coriander leaves, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
