## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then boil a kettle

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Tip: Chop them in different ways to create an interesting texture!

Dissolve your beef stock mix and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once very hot, add the steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


### Step 4

Once done, transfer the cooked steak to a plate and rest until serving

Return the pan to a medium heat

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan looks dry!

Add the chopped mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, discarding the stalks


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have softened, add your ground smoked paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the creamy stock with your Dijon mustard and Chinese rice wine and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your stroganoff sauce


### Step 7

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board

### Step 8

Serve the sliced steak over the stroganoff sauce with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!
