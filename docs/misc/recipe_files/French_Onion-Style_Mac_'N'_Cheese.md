### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, then add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> milk and the starchy pasta water into the roux, and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then stir through half the grated cheese (save the rest for later!) with your clotted cream – this is your cheese sauce

### Step 6

Add most of the caramelised onion to the cheese sauce with the drained macaroni and stir everything together – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to an oven-proof dish and sprinkle over the remaining caramelised onion, panko breadcrumbs and remaining grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your French onion-style mac 'n' cheese

### Step 7

While the mac 'n' cheese is cooking, combine your white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the French onion-style mac 'n' cheese with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
