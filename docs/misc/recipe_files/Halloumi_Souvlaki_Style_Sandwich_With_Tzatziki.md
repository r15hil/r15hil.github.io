## Ingredients

- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Halloumi (200g)
- Mint (5g)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove
- Tomato x2
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and your dried oregano

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice half your cucumber[s] into discs

Cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water


### Step 3

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with half the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), half the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tzatziki


### Step 4

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Slice your halloumi into 2 strips per person lengthways


### Step 5

Combine the sliced halloumi and your ground cumin in a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, remaining chopped garlic and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your marinated halloumi


### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated halloumi and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until crispy and golden brown on both sides – this is your crispy halloumi


### Step 7

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty, then carefully slice in half before serving

Combine the sliced tomato and cucumber discs in a bowl with the remaining chopped mint, red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber & tomato salad

### Step 8

To assemble, top your crusty ciabatta base with the crispy halloumi, a dollop of tzatziki, a handful of herby fries and the crusty ciabatta lid – this is your halloumi Souvlaki-style sandwich

Serve the remaining herby fries, cucumber & tomato salad and any remaining tzatziki to the side

Enjoy!
