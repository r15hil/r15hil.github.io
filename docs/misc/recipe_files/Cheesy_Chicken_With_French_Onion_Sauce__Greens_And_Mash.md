### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[125ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 10 min or until the onion is soft, stirring frequently

### Step 2

Once the onion is soft, increase the heat to a medium-high and add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 10 min further or until caramelised

Tip: Watch them like a hawk and stir frequently to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 275ml <span class="text-purple">[360ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[470ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onions have caramelised, add the chopped garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> plain flour and cook for 30 sec or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer to a small bowl and set aside for later

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, reduce the heat to medium and add the beef stock, caramelised onion and dried basil to the pan

Cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Wash your cavolo nero, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop it roughly, removing any tough stalks

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chopped cavolo nero, spinach and a splash of water to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted – these are your wilted greens

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the lid and sprinkle the grated cheese over the chicken

Return the lid and cook for 1-2 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy chicken and French onion sauce

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your olive oil mash

### Step 8

Slice the cheesy chicken finely

Serve the French onion sauce and the sliced cheesy chicken over the olive oil mash with the wilted greens to the side

Enjoy!
