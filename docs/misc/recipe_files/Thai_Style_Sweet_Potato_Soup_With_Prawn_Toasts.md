### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and white potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into bite-sized pieces

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Peel half your garlic clove[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(you'll use the rest later!)

### Step 2

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper then add the peeled garlic, chopped sweet potato, white potato, carrot and onion wedges

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until everything is lightly charred and tender – this is your roasted veg

### Step 3

Peel and grate the remaining garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Drain your king prawns and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Chop the drained prawns on a clean board until they are very finely minced (keep chopping until they become sticky!)

Combine the minced prawns in a bowl with the grated garlic and grated ginger

### Step 4

Trim the curved tops off your ciabatta[s] so that you are left with a flat surface, discard the trimmings

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-1642007540624-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Slice the trimmed ciabattas in half through the middle, then into 4 triangles per person

Spread the minced prawns onto the ciabatta triangles

Press your toasted sesame seeds onto the minced prawns – these are your prawn ciabattas

Boil a kettle

### Step 6

Once the roasted veg is tender, heat a large, wide-based pot over a high heat

Add the red Thai curry paste with the roasted veg, vegetable stock mix, 700ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water and the coriander (save some leaves for garnish!) then bring to the boil

Once boiling, remove the pot from the heat and use a (stick) blender (or add to a food processor) to blitz until smooth, then return to a low heat to keep warm – this is your Thai-style sweet potato soup

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1642007567070-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the prawn ciabattas and fry for 3-4 min on each side or until the prawns are cooked through and the toast is golden – these are your prawn toasts

Tip: You may need to do this in batches, or use a second pan!

### Step 8

Serve the Thai-style sweet potato soup topped with the reserved coriander leaves

Serve the prawn toasts to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
