## Ingredients

- Ground coriander (1tsp) x0
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- Spring onion
- Ground coriander (2tsp)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Haddock bites (100g) x0
- Haddock bites (200g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Lime
- Red pepper
- Tomato x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, ground coriander and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes and diced pepper to the bowl and give everything a good mix up

Transfer the spiced potatoes & pepper to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and reserve the bowl along with any excess marinade

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the potatoes are crispy and the pepper is slightly charred


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) half your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic and chopped tomato to the reserved bowl with your red wine vinegar

Add the lime zest and half the sliced spring onion (reserve the rest for a garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa


### Step 5

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the remaining garlic

Cut the zested lime[s] into 2 wedges per person


### Step 6

Once the potatoes and pepper are almost ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Once hot, add the sliced garlic, your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the haddock bites to the pan with the juice of half the lime wedges

Cook for 5 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through – this is your chilli-lime haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the charred pepper & roast potatoes with the tomato salsa to the side, and top with the chilli-lime haddock

Drizzle over any pan sauce and garnish with a remaining lime wedge and remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
