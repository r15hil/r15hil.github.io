### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 390°F/ Gas 6


Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)


Add the tomato paste and dried oregano to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar


Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce
