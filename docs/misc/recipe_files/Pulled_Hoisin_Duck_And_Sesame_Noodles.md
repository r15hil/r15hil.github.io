### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your duck leg[s] with the white fat and duck jelly to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper then put in the oven for 28 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Slice a few chilli rounds (set them aside for garnish) then cut your remaining red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, add your wholewheat noodles to a large pot, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles, and reserve the pot

### Step 4

Wash your spring greens, then rip the leaves off, discard the tough stalks, and layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely

### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until starting to wilt

Add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until completely wilted, then stir in the cooked noodles, half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and toasted sesame oil – these are your sesame noodles

### Step 6

Once the duck legs are golden and crispy, remove the tray from the oven and transfer the duck legs to a clean board

Shred the duck meat apart with two forks, discard the bones – this technique is known as 'pulling' – this is your pulled duck

### Step 7

Combine the pulled duck and hoisin sauce in a large bowl with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the remaining soy sauce

Give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled hoisin duck

### Step 8

Serve the pulled hoisin duck over the sesame noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds, chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
