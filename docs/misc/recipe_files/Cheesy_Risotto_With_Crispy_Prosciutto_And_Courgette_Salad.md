### Step 2

Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add your blanched peas to a colander and rinse under cold running water to refresh them

### Step 3

Add the courgette ribbons and refreshed peas to a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your courgette & pea salad

### Step 4

Add your sliced prosciutto to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your sliced prosciutto every 30 secs to prevent it from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 6

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Reboil a kettle

### Step 7

Once the risotto is cooked, add the grated cheddar cheese and a small knob of butter and gently stir it all together – this is your cheesy risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Break the crispy prosciutto into shards and serve the cheesy risotto topped with your grated Italian hard cheese, prosciutto shards and drizzle over your truffle oil

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the truffle oil or just add a little!</span>

Serve the courgette & pea salad and a lemon wedge to the side
