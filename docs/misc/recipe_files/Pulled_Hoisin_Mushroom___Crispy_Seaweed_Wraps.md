### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Using clean hands, tear your chestnut mushrooms into small pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!), trying to spread them out as much as possible

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for an initial 10-15 min, until starting to brown and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your agave and ground smoked paprika and stir it all together – this is your smoky dressing

Wash your spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

### Step 3

Add the sliced spring greens to a large baking tray (or two) and sprinkle with a very generous pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a large drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 min or until crispy – this is your crispy 'seaweed'

### Step 4

Once the mushrooms are starting to brown, remove the tray[s] from the oven and pour over the smoky dressing

Mix it all together and return the tray[s] to the oven for 8-10 min further or until caramelised

### Step 5

While the mushrooms are caramelising, slice your cucumber in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds with a spoon then slice into matchsticks, discard the seeds

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into batons

### Step 6

Add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)

Add your hoisin sauce to a bowl along with your onion marmalade and mix it all together – this is your sticky hoisin sauce

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/RC2439Step-7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the mushrooms have caramelised, divide the mixture evenly between the warmed tortillas

Dollop over the sticky hoisin sauce, pack with cucumber matchsticks, spring onion batons and garnish with crispy 'seaweed' and crispy onions – these are your pulled hoisin mushroom & crispy 'seaweed' wraps

### Step 8

Serve the pulled hoisin mushroom & crispy ‘seaweed’ wraps with any remaining cucumber matchsticks and spring onion batons to the side

Enjoy!
