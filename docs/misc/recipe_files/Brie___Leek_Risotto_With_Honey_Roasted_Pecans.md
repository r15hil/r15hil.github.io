## Ingredients

- 160g arborio rice
- 20g rocket
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 Button Mill brie 
- 10.5g wholegrain mustard
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 leek
- 25g honey
- 25g pecan nuts
- 1 garlic clove
- 30g dried cranberries
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water and add the Chinese rice wine


### Step 3

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half lengthways, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves

Then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 4

Once the onion has started to soften, add the chopped leek, garlic and dried oregano

Cook for 5 min further or until the leek has softened


### Step 5

Once the leek has softened, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20-25 min or until most of the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked

Grate the brie coarsely (or roughly chop into small cubes)

Roughly chop the dried cranberries


### Step 6

Whilst the rice is cooking, bash the pecans with a rolling pin into small pieces (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

Add the crushed pecans to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and drizzle over half of the honey (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until golden and crunchy – these are your honey roasted pecans

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!


### Step 7

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the grated brie, half <span class="text-danger">[all] </span>the wholegrain mustard and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the rest of the wholegrain mustard for another recipe!

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice is cooked with a slight bite – this is your brie & leek risotto

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the brie & leek risotto topped with the honey roasted pecans and chopped cranberries

Garnish with the rocket and drizzle over the remaining honey

Enjoy!
