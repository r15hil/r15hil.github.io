### Step 1

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s], and garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a pot with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until sizzling

Once the cumin seeds start to sizzle, carefully add your basmati rice and stir it all together

### Step 3

Add your ground turmeric and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water with a pinch of salt to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your turmeric rice

### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped paneer, ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your ground cumin, curry powder and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your tomato paste and stir it all together

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan looks a little dry

### Step 6

Give everything a good mix up, then cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your paneer pathia

### Step 7

Once the sauce has nearly thickened, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the warmed naan once out of the toaster

Meanwhile, chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the paneer pathia with the turmeric rice and a warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
