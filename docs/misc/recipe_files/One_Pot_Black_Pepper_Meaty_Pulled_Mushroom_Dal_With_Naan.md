### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min] </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meaty pulled mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min

After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and give everything a stir

Return the dish, uncovered, to the oven for 5 min further or until the lentils have split – this is your black pepper meaty pulled mushroom dal

Add the plain naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Top the black pepper meaty pulled mushroom dal with the crispy onions

Tear over the coriander and mint leaves and serve the warmed naans to the side

Tip: Watch out for the ginger halves and discard them!
