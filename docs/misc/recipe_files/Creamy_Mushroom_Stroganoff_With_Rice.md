## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, cut half your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges and dice the remaining onion finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and your ground paprika with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your flat white mushrooms and chestnut mushrooms thickly

Boil half a kettle


### Step 5

Once the diced onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and onion wedges to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Increase the heat to high and add all the chopped mushrooms to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and a small drizzle of olive oil

Cook for 5-6 min or until the mushrooms have softened


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water with your Dijon mustard and Henderson's Relish – this is your stock

Once the mushrooms have softened, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour to the pan and stir everything together

Add the stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened


### Step 7

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through most of your soured cream (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your creamy mushroom stroganoff

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mushroom stroganoff over the cooked rice

Dollop over the remaining soured cream and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
