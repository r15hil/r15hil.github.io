### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

### Step 2

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped onion and cook for 5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further

### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

### Step 5

Add your orzo to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the stock and your soft cheese and cook, covered, stirring frequently, for 12-15 min or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Stirring the orzo will release the starch from the pasta, making it creamier!

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop it roughly

Tear your basil leaves

Grate your cheddar cheese

### Step 7

Add the chopped spinach, halved tomatoes and grated cheese to the orzo with half the torn basil leaves (save the rest for later!) and cook until the spinach has wilted

Give everything a good mix up – this is your one pot creamy chicken thigh florentine

### Step 8

Serve the one pot creamy chicken thigh florentine

Garnish with the remaining torn basil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!
