### Step 1

Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Boil a kettle and chop your waxy potatoes in half, then add to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and rinse them under cold water until cooled slightly (save the pot for later!)

### Step 2

Whilst the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and season both sides with a pinch of salt

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side

Tip: You'll be returning these to the pan later!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once cooked, transfer the steak to a plate to rest

Return the pan to a medium heat, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until starting to caramelise

### Step 4

While the onion and pepper are cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

On a clean chopping board, trim the fat from the steak and discard

Slice the rested steak as finely as you can

### Step 5

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once the ciabatta is warmed through, remove from the toaster and spread with a thin layer of butter

### Step 6

Once the onion and pepper has caramelised, add the sliced steak and soy sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Top with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your Philly-style cheesesteak filling

### Step 7

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine your mayo, white wine vinegar and a pinch of pepper in the reserved potato pot and give everything a good mix up

Add the cooled potatoes and crush them lightly with a fork

Add most of the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your potato salad

### Step 8

Stuff your warmed ciabatta with the Philly-style cheesesteak filling and slice in half – this is your Philly-style cheesesteak sandwich

Serve with the potato salad to the side and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
