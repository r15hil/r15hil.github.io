Meanwhile, add the carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a large bowl with the mayo and a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy slaw

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a large knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the grated garlic, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring frequently, until you're left with a sandy paste

Whisk in the stock, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your gravy

### Step 6

Add the southern fried seasoning to a large bowl with 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> flour and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chicken thighs to the bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up so the chicken is evenly coated – this is your coated chicken

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 7-8 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) (cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!)

Once done, season the cooked chicken with a pinch of salt – this is your southern fried chicken

### Step 8

Serve the southern fried chicken with the creamy slaw, fries and gravy to the side

Enjoy!
