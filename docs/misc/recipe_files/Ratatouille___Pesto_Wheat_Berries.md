## Description

Ratatouille, traditionally a French stew of sweet mixed vegetables, normally requires hours of slow cooking. We've simplified this method by tossing vegetables in olive oil and roasting them in a hot oven, then combining them with a rich tomato sauce. Sat over nutty wheat berries, dressed in a cheese and basil pesto. Ratatou-easy!

### Step 7

Add the drained wheat berries and mix to combine - these are your pesto wheat berries

### Step 8

Serve the ratatouille over the&nbsp;pesto wheat berries


Top with the remaining grated cheese&nbsp;and a generous grind of black pepper
