### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl (reserve the pan!) with the chopped parsley and give everything a good mix up – these are your herby almonds

### Step 5

Add your basmati rice and grated carrot to a pot with a lid with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat, mix through your sultanas and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana rice

### Step 6

Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with your ginger paste, garam masala and ground turmeric

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato to the pan with the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened

Once thickened, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through – this is your mild king prawn curry

### Step 8

Serve the mild king prawn curry with the sultana rice to the side

Garnish with the herby almonds
