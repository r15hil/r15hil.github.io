### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your cauliflower[s] into bite-sized florets, discarding the leaves and add to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, your curry powder and a very generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cauliflower is tender – this is your roasted curried cauliflower

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Boil half a kettle
