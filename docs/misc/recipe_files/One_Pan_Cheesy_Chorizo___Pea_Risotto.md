### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your Chinese rice wine, arborio rice and the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the chopped mangetout and cook for 2-3 min

Add your blanched peas and cook for 1 min further or until the mangetout is tender and the peas are warmed through

Stir through a knob of butter with most of the grated cheese and most of the crispy chorizo (save some for garnish!) – this is your one-pan cheesy chorizo & pea risotto

### Step 8

Serve the one-pan cheesy chorizo & pea risotto topped with the reserved grated cheese, reserved crispy chorizo and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
