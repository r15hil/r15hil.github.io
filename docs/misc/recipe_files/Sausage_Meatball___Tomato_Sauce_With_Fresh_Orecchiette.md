### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Roll your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) into 6<span class="text-danger"> </span>meatballs per person (clean hands are the best way!)

### Step 3

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook, turning occasionally, for 4-5 min or until starting to brown

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 5

While the orecchiette is cooking, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1683889929921-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the meatballs are starting to brown, add the sliced garlic, dried oregano and dried basil to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1683889934487-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Stir the drained orecchiette and half the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!) into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is nicely coated – this is your sausage meatball & tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the sausage meatball & tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette topped with your grated Italian hard cheese and remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!
