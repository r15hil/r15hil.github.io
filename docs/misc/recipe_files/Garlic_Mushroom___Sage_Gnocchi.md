## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a small dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine kernel & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, strip your sage leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter and a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for 2 min


### Step 5

While the mushrooms are cooking, add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing


### Step 7

Add the chopped sage leaves and roasted garlic paste to the mushrooms, give everything a good mix up and cook for 30 secs

Add the drained gnocchi with a small splash of starchy cooking water, half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a grind of pepper, then give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic mushroom & sage gnocchi

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and toss in the dressing

### Step 8

Serve the garlic mushroom & sage gnocchi with the dressed salad to the side

Top with the toasted pine kernel & seed mix and remaining grated cheese

Enjoy!
