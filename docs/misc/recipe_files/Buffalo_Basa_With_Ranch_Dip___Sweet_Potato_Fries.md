## Ingredients

- Chives (5g)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Sriracha hot chilli sauce (8ml)
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Garlic clove
- Cider vinegar (15ml) x0
- Cider vinegar (30ml)
- Gem lettuce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your sweet potato[es] into fries


### Step 2

Add the sweet potato fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the fries are cooking, cut your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add your cornflour and a pinch of salt to a bowl

Add the basa pieces to the cornflour and give everything a good mix up so the basa pieces are fully coated – this is your coated basa


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side, or until nicely golden and crisp

Once done, transfer the golden basa to a plate covered with kitchen paper and set aside for later

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Meanwhile, heat a pot with 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span><span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter on a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add the sriracha (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp] sugar

Stir everything together until it combines and becomes a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper then slice into wedges

Chop your chives finely, then peel and grate your garlic

Combine your natural yoghurt, Dijon mustard, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and chopped chives in a bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch dip


### Step 7

Return the buffalo sauce to a medium heat

Once hot, add the golden basa to the pot and toss until the basa is fully coated in the sauce – this is your buffalo basa

### Step 8

Serve the buffalo basa with the sweet potato fries, ranch dip and lettuce wedges to the side

Enjoy!
