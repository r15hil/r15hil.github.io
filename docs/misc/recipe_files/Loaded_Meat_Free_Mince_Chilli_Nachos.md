## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Meanwhile, stack your tortillas and slice into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a tray (or two!) with half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Toss everything together then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 4

Once the mince has browned, add your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin and remaining ground smoked paprika to the pan and cook for 2 min or until all the mince is coated in the spices

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your kidney beans


### Step 5

Add the drained kidney beans to the pan along with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and your tomato paste

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency, then remove from the heat – this is your meat-free mince chilli

Tip: Add an extra splash of water if it's looking a little dry!


### Step 6

While the sauce is thickening, trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]

Roughly dice your tomato[es]

Chop your coriander, including the stalks


### Step 7

Add the chopped spring onion[s], tomato and coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free mince chilli with the nachos and tomato salsa to the side

Grate your cheddar cheese over the top and dollop over your soured cream

Enjoy!
