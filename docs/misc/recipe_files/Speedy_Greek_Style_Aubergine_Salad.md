## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 130ml <span class="text-danger">[260ml]</span> boiled water

Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl with the vegetable stock, cover and set aside


### Step 3

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut lengthways then dice into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced aubergine to the pan and cook for 4-5 min until starting to brown


### Step 5

While the aubergine is browning, chop the cucumber into quarters, lengthways, then chop roughly

Chop the baby plum tomatoes in half

Roughly chop the black olives


### Step 6

Once the aubergine is browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the dried oregano, garlic paste and juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and cook for 2-3 min or until the aubergine is cooked through and softened – this is your Greek-style aubergine


### Step 7

Chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped cucumber, tomatoes and olives to a bowl

Add the juice of the remaining lemon, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your chopped salad

Fluff the softend couscous with a fork then add the chopped parsley – this is your herby couscous

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style aubergine with the chopped salad and herby couscous to the side

Crumble over the feta 

Enjoy!
