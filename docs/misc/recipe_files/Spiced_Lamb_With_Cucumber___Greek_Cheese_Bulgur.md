### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 4 min or until softened

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 4

Stir your ras el hanout and tomato paste into the onion

Increase the heat to high, then add your lamb mince and cook for 7-10 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!), then add 125ml <span class="text-purple">[160ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water to create a ragù-like sauce – this is your spiced lamb

Dice the halved cucumber


### Step 6

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks, discard the stalks

Finely chop the mint leaves
