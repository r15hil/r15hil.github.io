## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set them aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 5

Meanwhile, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Slice your sweet pointed pepper[s] into rounds

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water

Slice your chicken thighs into strips


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped ginger and garlic, diced apricots and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until the garlic has softened

Once softened, add the chicken strips and cook for 3-4 min

Add the chopped tomato, pepper rounds, chicken stock and juice of half your lemon and cook, covered, for 8-10 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Moroccan-style chicken & apricot tagine


### Step 7

Whilst the tagine is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Fluff the couscous with a fork and add the juice of the remaining lemon

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and half the chopped parsley and mix everything together – this is your herby couscous

Stir the remaining chopped parsley through the Moroccan-style chicken & apricot tagine

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style chicken & apricot tagine with the herby couscous to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!
