## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Cut your cauliflower into small florets, discard the stem and leaves

Add the cauliflower florets to a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a large pinch of salt and pepper and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up until all the cauliflower is coated


### Step 3

Line a baking tray with baking paper

Add the coated cauliflower to the tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your cashew nuts to a food processor and blitz until you're left with a very fine crumb

Tip: No food processor? Bash the cashew nuts in a pestle & mortar into a fine powder!

Chop your chives finely


### Step 5

Add the blended cashew nuts and chopped chives to a bowl with your mayo, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and mix everything together – this is your nutty dip


### Step 6

Add your cornflour to a bowl with your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and tomato ketchup and mix to form a smooth paste

Add your soy sauce and agave and mix until everything is combined – this is your spicy buffalo sauce


### Step 7

Remove the cauliflower from the oven and spoon the spicy buffalo sauce evenly over each floret (use a pastry brush if you have one!)

Return the tray to the oven for 10 min or until the cauliflower is slightly charred and the sauce is sticky – this is your spicy buffalo cauliflower

Meanwhile wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and chop into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the spicy buffalo cauliflower with the chips, lettuce wedges and nutty dip to the side

Enjoy!
