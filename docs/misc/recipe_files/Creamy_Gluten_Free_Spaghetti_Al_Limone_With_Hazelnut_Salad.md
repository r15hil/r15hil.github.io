## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle and heat a large, dry pan over a medium heat

Chop your hazelnuts roughly

Once hot, add the chopped hazelnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half


### Step 3

Add your gluten free spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 4

While the spaghetti is cooking, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Combine half the lemon zest (save the rest for later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a large bowl with your honey and the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon honey dressing


### Step 5

Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the halved tomatoes and salad to the lemon honey dressing with the toasted hazelnuts and give everything a good mix up – this is your hazelnut salad


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, the remaining lemon zest and a generous grind of pepper and mix it all together

Cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the drained spaghetti and clotted cream to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water, vegetable stock mix and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until the sauce coats the pasta

Once coated, remove the pan from the heat and add your grated Italian hard cheese, half the chopped parsley and a generous grind of pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your creamy gluten free spaghetti al limone

### Step 8

Serve the creamy gluten free spaghetti al limone and garnish with the cheese shavings and remaining chopped parsley

Serve the hazelnut salad to the side

Enjoy!
