### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!
