Dice your tomato[es]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your ground cumin and ground coriander and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Once fragrant, add the diced tomato and chopped garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the tomato has softened

Boil a kettle


### Step 4

### Step 5

Once the tomato has softened, add the chopped sweet potato, spicy stock, and quinoa to the pan and cook for 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is tender


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)

Once the sweet potato is tender, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Add the chopped coriander to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the haddock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Season with a pinch of pepper – this is your Peruvian-style haddock & sweet potato stew

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
