- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Portobello mushroom tortelloni (250g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Divide your sausage meat into bite sized balls (remove the paper if required!)


### Step 3

Once hot, add the sausage meatballs to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the sausage is starting to brown, add the dried oregano and most of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and chopped tomatoes to the pan with the sausage and give everything a good stir

Cook for 3 min further or until the sauce thickens slightly and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Stir the drained tortelloni and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the spicy sausage & creamy tomato sauce with mushroom tortelloni topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the reserved chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
