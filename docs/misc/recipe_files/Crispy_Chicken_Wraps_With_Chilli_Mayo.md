### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add a handful of flour to a plate along with your ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your spiced flour

### Step 2

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the grated cheese, lots of pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

### Step 3

Coat the chicken breast strips in the spiced flour (make sure to tap off any excess!)

Add the coated chicken strips to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded chicken strips

### Step 4

Line a baking tray with tin foil

Add the breaded chicken strips to the tray and top them with any remaining cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your crispy chicken strips

### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred

### Step 6

Add your red chilli relish to a bowl with your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your chilli mayo

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1585753227639-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the chicken strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

### Step 8

Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy chicken strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!
