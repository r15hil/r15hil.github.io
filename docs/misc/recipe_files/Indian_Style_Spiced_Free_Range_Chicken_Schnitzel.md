### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop the waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 minutes or until golden

### Step 2

Add the free range chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

### Step 3

Add a handful of flour to a plate

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a shallow bowl

Combine your panko breadcrumbs and nigella seeds with your curry powder, a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt on a separate plate

### Step 4

Coat the butterflied chicken in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the vegetable oil and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indian-style spiced free range chicken schnitzel

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix with half your mayo, half your white wine vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt – this is your slaw

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the remaining mayo and white wine vinegar with the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) – this is your garlic mayo

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1712133506359-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are golden, remove the tray from the oven and drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray to the oven for a final 5 min – these are your spicy potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the Indian-style spiced free range chicken schnitzel with the spicy potatoes, slaw and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!
