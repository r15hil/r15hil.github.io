### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and roughly chop half your red onion[s]

Finely slice the remaining red onion and set aside for later

### Step 3

Peel and roughly chop half your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

### Step 4

Add the chopped onion to a food processor with the chopped parsley and chopped garlic, then pulse until everything is finely chopped

Once finely chopped, add the drained chickpeas, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour, vegetable stock mix, ground cumin, a small drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Pulse until everything is blitzed but not smooth – this is your falafel mix

### Step 5

Divide the falafel mix and shape into 3 balls per person (clean hands is the best way!)

Add the falafel balls to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray, then press down gently to flatten them and shape into discs

Drizzle the falafel with olive oil and bake for an initial 15 min or until golden and firm – these are your herby falafel

### Step 6

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

Chop your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1682354246426-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Add your tahini to a small bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>warm water and mix until fully combined and smooth

Add your natural yoghurt, chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) a pinch of salt and a squeeze of<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon juice, then stir it all together – this is your tahini yoghurt

Once the falafel have been cooking for 15 min, add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the other side of the baking tray and return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min further or until warmed through

### Step 8

Top the warmed pitta with most of the shredded lettuce, red onion slices, tomato wedges and herby falafel

Drizzle over the tahini yoghurt and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with a lemon wedge

Serve the chips and remaining shredded lettuce, red onion slices & tomato wedges to the side

Enjoy!
