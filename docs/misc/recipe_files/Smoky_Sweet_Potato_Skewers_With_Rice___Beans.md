## Ingredients

- 150g canned sweetcorn
- 0 cherry tomatoes
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 185g canned black beans
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 80g brown rice
- 1 sweet potato
- 10g coriander
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 0 coriander
- 250g cherry tomatoes
- 2 spring onions
- 1/2 garlic clove
- 4 skewers

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into 2 wedges per person, lengthways

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)


### Step 2

Add the sweet potato wedges to a large bowl with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up

Thread the seasoned sweet potato wedges onto the soaked skewers, lengthways

Add the skewers to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through and starting to crisp – these are your smoky sweet potato skewers


### Step 3

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Drain your sweetcorn


### Step 5

Add the sliced spring onion, halved tomatoes and drained sweetcorn to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your corn salad


### Step 6

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine the chopped coriander, grated garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and white wine vinegar in a small bowl with your natural yoghurt and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chimichurri yoghurt


### Step 7

Drain and rinse your black beans

Combine the drained black beans with the brown rice – this is your rice & beans

### Step 8

Serve the rice & beans alongside the corn salad topped with the smoky sweet potato skewers

Drizzle over the chimichurri yoghurt

Enjoy!
