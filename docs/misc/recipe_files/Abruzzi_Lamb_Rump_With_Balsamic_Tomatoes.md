### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6 and boil a kettle

Cut the waxy potatoes into discs, then add them to a pot of boiling water over a high heat and cook for 8 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and set aside to steam dry

Meanwhile, add the pistachios to a baking tray and put in the oven for 3 min or until lightly toasted

### Step 2

Pat the lamb rump dry with kitchen paper and season all over with a generous pinch of salt

Once the pistachios are done, transfer them to a bowl

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned lamb and cook for 4-5 min or until golden all over

### Step 3

While the lamb is cooking, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the tray lined with baking paper, with the balsamic vinegar and a generous pinch of salt

Drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil, give everything a good mix up and push them to one side of the tray – these are your balsamic tomatoes

### Step 4

Transfer the lamb to the other side of the tomato tray (reserve the pan for later!) and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the lamb is pink and blushing and the tomatoes have caramelised

Once the lamb is done, transfer it to a plate, cover and leave to rest for 5 min

Tip: Switch the oven off and return the balsamic tomatoes to the oven to keep warm until serving

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if it's looking a little dry

Once hot, add the rosemary sprigs, drained potatoes and a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently, for 15-17 min or until golden and crispy – these are your sautéed potatoes

### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and chop the garlic roughly

Chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks

Garnish with the reserved chopped pistachios

Buon appetito!
