- Soy sauce (15ml)
- Soy sauce (8ml) x0
- Red chilli
- Hoisin sauce (20g) x0

- Toasted sesame oil (10ml)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until they’re browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut a few chilli rounds (set them aside for garnish), then cut the remaining red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Once the chicken has browned, add a splash of cold water and cook, covered for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

While the chicken is cooking, add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and set aside in a bowl and reserve the pot for later


### Step 5

Wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and shred it apart with two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pan to a medium heat with the pulled chicken and add the chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), hoisin sauce, soy sauce and 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water

Cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken is coated in a sticky sauce – this is your pulled hoisin chicken


### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until starting to wilt

Add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 2 min or until completely wilted, then stir in the drained noodles and toasted sesame oil – these are your sesame noodles

### Step 8

Serve the pulled hoisin free range chicken over the sesame noodles

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
