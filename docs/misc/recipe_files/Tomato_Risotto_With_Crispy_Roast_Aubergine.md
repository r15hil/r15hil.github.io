## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water then stir in your dried basil and tomato paste – this is your tomato stock


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice to the pan with the chopped garlic and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs

Add the tomato stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut into quarters, lengthways, then slice finely

Add the sliced aubergine to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 20 min, turning once halfway, until golden and tender


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your baby plum tomatoes in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the halved tomatoes to a large bowl with the salad – this is your salad

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the aubergine is golden and tender, push it together in the centre of the baking tray

Sprinkle over half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Return the tray to the oven for 5 min or until the cheese has melted and the aubergine has crisped slightly – this is your crispy roast aubergine


### Step 7

Once the rice is tender, add the remaining grated Italian hard cheese with half the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your tomato risotto

Add the balsamic dressing to the bowl with the salad and gently mix it all together – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the tomato risotto topped with the crispy roast aubergine

Garnish with the reserved chopped basil, a drizzle of olive oil, a grind of black pepper and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
