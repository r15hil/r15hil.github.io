## Ingredients

- 20g rocket
- 2 tomato paste sachets (64g)
- 1 squid ink sachet (4g)
- 2 flame-baked pizza bases
- 1 tomato ketchup sachet (30ml)
- 100g British diced chorizo
- 30g pitted black olives
- 125g mozzarella
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 390°F/ Gas 6


Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisp


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic 


Add the chopped garlic to a bowl with the squid ink, tomato paste with 5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of sugar and pepper


Add the cooked chorizo and stir it all together – this is your spooky pizza sauce


### Step 3

Chop your black olives into fun shapes, this is where you can be as creative as you like!


Tip: To make a spider, cut your black olives in half lengthways, using one half for the body and cutting some of the other halves into smaller pieces for spider legs!


These are your olive spiders


### Step 4

Drain and pat the mozzarella really dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)


Tear the drained mozzarella into long shreds – these are your mozzarella cobwebs


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s</span><span class="text-danger">]</span> from the oven and add the pizza bases


Divide the spooky pizza sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon


### Step 6

Top with the mozzarella cobwebs


Add the olive spiders (or any other spooky creation!)


### Step 7

Put the tray in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your chorizo &amp; olive tombstone pizzas


Once cooked, let the pizzas cool slightly before transferring them to a clean board or plate to decorate

### Step 8

Decorate with the rocket and tomato ketchup to create a spooky scene


Enjoy!
