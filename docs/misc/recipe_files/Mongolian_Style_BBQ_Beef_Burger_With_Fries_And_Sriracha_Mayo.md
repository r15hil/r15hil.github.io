## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are in the oven, combine your soy sauce, hoisin sauce, tomato ketchup and ginger & garlic paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a bowl – this is your Mongolian-style BBQ marinade


### Step 3

Combine your beef mince and half your Mongolian-style BBQ marinade in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape them into 1 patty per person – these are your Mongolian-style BBQ patty[ies]


### Step 4

Add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[175ml]</span> [200ml]</span> boiled water to the remaining marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your Mongolian-style BBQ sauce

Combine your carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix with your rice vinegar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your quick-pickled mooli slaw


### Step 5

Sprinkle your cornflour over both sides of the beef patty[ies] and pat down until fully coated – these are your coated patty[ies]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on one side until slightly charred

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 6

After 5 min, decrease the heat to medium-high and turn the patty[ies] over, then add the Mongolian-style BBQ sauce to the pan

Reserve the bowl

Cook for 5 min further, spooning the sauce over the patty[ies] until thickened to a gravy-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in the reserved bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] with the chips from the oven and add the brioche halves, cut side up, then return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, top each brioche base with the sriracha mayo, a handful of quick-pickled mooli slaw and a Mongolian-style BBQ beef patty, drizzle over a little Mongolian-style BBQ sauce and top with a brioche lid

Serve the remaining quick-pickled Mooli slaw and chips to the side with any remaining Mongolian-style BBQ sauce to a small pot and serve to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
