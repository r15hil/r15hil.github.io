## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems


### Step 2

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add half the chopped spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1 min or until beginning to soften slightly


### Step 4

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add the chopped garlic, chopped thyme, smoked paprika and half of the chopped cherry tomatoes (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and mix well


### Step 5

Add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!


### Step 6

Add the remaining chopped cherry tomatoes when the rice is nearly cooked – this is your cherry tomato risotto

Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat then add your grated Italian hard cheese and a knob of butter and stir through

Taste for seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed


### Step 7

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your meat-free bacon to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy

Remove the cooked meat-free bacon from the pan and chop roughly

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

### Step 8

Serve the cherry tomato risotto in a bowl with the salad to the side

Sprinkle the meat-free bacon over the risotto

Garnish with the remaining spring onion

Enjoy!
