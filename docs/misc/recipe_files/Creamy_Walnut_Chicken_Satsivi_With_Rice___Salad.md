## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, and your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 2

Meanwhile, roughly chop your walnuts

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Once the chicken is lightly browned, add the chopped walnuts, chopped garlic and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour to the pan with your ground coriander, ground fenugreek (not a fan of fenugreek? Only add a little!) and 2/3 of your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix to the pan with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Combine the sliced shallot and remaining red wine vinegar in a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Combine the salad and chopped tomato in a large bowl with the quick-pickled shallot and the pickling liquid and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot salad

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat

Add your crème fraîche to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy walnut chicken satsivi

### Step 8

Serve the creamy walnut chicken satsivi next to the cooked rice

Garnish with the remaining ground smoked paprika

Serve the quick-pickled shallot salad to the side

Enjoy!
