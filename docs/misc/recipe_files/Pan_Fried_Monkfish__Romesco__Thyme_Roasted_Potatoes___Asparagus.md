Set the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6

Add the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over the smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray in the oven for 20 minutes or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and chop the potatoes into small bite-sized pieces

Strip the thyme leaves and chop them roughly, discarding the stems

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Add the chopped potatoes and thyme to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden and crispy

### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the garlic

Once softened, add the roasted pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> to a food processor with the chopped garlic, half the flaked almonds, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Blitz until smooth – this is your romesco sauce

Tip: You'll serve this at room temperature so set this aside until serving

### Step 6

Re-boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the monkfish fillets and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add a knob of butter, flip the fish and cook for 3-4 minutes further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque

### Step 7

Pour the boiling water into a pot over a high heat and add a pinch of salt

Bring the water to the boil, add the asparagus and cook for 4 minutes or until tender, then drain

Tip: Adding salt to the water keeps your asparagus bright green

Return the cooked asparagus to the pot and stir in a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining flaked almonds

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried monkfish over the romesco sauce with the thyme-roasted potatoes and asparagus spears to the side

Enjoy!
