## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the fries are cooking, add your beef mince to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) then shape into 1 patty per person – this is your burger patty[ies]


### Step 3

Add the burger patty[ies] to an oiled baking tray (or two!) with your streaky bacon

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the bacon is crispy


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Chop a large knob of butter into small cubes

Peel your Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings


### Step 5

Once the fries are golden, remove them from the oven and push to one side of the tray[s], then top the fries with the chopped butter, garlic and parsley and gently toss everything together – these are your garlic butter fries

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the butter has melted and the brioche is warmed through


### Step 6

Once the burgers are cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top each patty with the Italian hard cheese shavings

Return to the oven for 2-3 min until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy beef patty[ies]

Tip: If your bacon is already crispy at this point, add it to a plate and set aside


### Step 7

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Reserve a handful of salad for your burger, then toss the remaining salad and the chopped tomato with a drizzle of olive oil and your balsamic vinegar – this is your dressed salad

Add your truffle oil to a small bowl along with your mayo and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together – this is your truffle mayo

### Step 8

Spread each warmed brioche base with a dollop of onion marmalade

Add a cheesy beef patty followed by the crispy bacon, a spoonful of truffle mayo, the reserved salad and top with a warmed brioche lid

Serve the dressed salad and garlic butter fries to the side with any remaining truffle mayo

Enjoy!
