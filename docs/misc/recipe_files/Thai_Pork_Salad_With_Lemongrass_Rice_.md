- 1 soy sauce sachet (8ml)
- 1 lime
- 2 tbsp Thai green curry paste 
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin to release the juices and add it to a pot (you may have to cut it to fit) with the rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">(700ml)</span> water&nbsp;


Bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low, cover and cook for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the onion with a big pinch of both salt and sugar (use brown sugar if you have it!)


Cook for 4 min or until slightly softened


### Step 3

Add the curry paste and cook for a few seconds&nbsp;


Add the pork mince and cook for 5-8 min or until the pork is starting to crisp


&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop off and discard the root end<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> of the lettuce and separate the leaves&nbsp;


Tip: By chopping off the base first, your leaves should separate easier


### Step 5

Chop the roasted peanuts roughly


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in half


Fluff the cooked rice and squeeze in the juice of half a&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">(whole)</span> lime

Add the soy sauce to the crispy pork


Cut the remaining lime into wedges
