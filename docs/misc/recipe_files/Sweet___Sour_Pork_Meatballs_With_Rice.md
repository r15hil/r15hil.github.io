### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the pork mixture and shape into 5 small meatballs per person – these are your pork meatballs

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pork meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

### Step 6

Once the pork meatballs are cooked through and browned, transfer to a plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the chopped pepper and carrot batons with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 7

Once the vegetables have softened, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the sliced spring onion, cooked pork meatballs and sweet & sour sauce and cook for 1 min further or until the pork meatballs are coated in sauce – these are your sweet & sour pork meatballs

### Step 8

Serve the sweet & sour pork meatballs over the cooked rice

Enjoy!
