## Ingredients

- 15g crispy onions
- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 fine egg noodle nest 
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 50g solid coconut cream
- 1 medium sweet potato
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk 
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 3 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and chop the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cumin seeds, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander and ground allspice and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant, then transfer to a bowl to cool down – this is your Vietnamese spice blend

Tip: Watch the spices like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!


### Step 3

Return the pan to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a large pinch of salt

Once hot add the chopped sweet potato and cook for 7-8 min or until browned all over and beginning to soften


### Step 4

While the sweet potato is softening, bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and set them aside, then chop the soft inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly


### Step 5

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 900ml <span class="text-danger">[1.8L]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock mix and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock


### Step 6

Once the sweet potato has browned and softened slightly, add the sliced garlic, chopped lemongrass inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and Vietnamese spice blend with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 1 min or until the garlic has softened

Add the Tenderstem broccoli, coconut stock and lemongrass outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for an initial 3-4 min


### Step 7

Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Add the fine egg noodles to the pan and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles, then cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until everything's tender – this is your Vietnamese-style sweet potato cà ri noodle soup

### Step 8

Serve the Vietnamese-style sweet potato cà ri noodle soup in bowls

Tip: Discard the outer lemongrass layer!

Tear over the coriander & mint and garnish with crispy onions

Enjoy!
