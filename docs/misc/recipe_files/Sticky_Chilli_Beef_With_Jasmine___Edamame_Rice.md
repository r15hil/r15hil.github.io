## Ingredients

- 250g British beef strips
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 300g chopped pepper & red onion
- 300g edamame & jasmine rice
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 30ml soy sauce
- 30ml tomato ketchup 
- 25g honey

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the beef strips and sprinkle over the cornflour

Cook for 1-2 min without stirring to get colour on one side of the beef

After 1-2 min, turn the beef and cook for 1-2 min further or until browned all over


### Step 2

Transfer the browned beef to a plate and set aside

Tip: Don't worry if it's not fully cooked yet, it'll go back in the sauce later!

Return the pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the ginger & garlic paste to the pan with the chopped pepper & onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the veg is softening, combine the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey, soy sauce, ketchup and rice vinegar in a small bowl – this is your sticky chilli sauce

Meanwhile, add the edamame & jasmine rice to a large, heatproof bowl and put the bowl in the microwave for 2-3 min or until piping hot


### Step 4

Once the veg has started to soften, return the browned beef to the pan and pour in the sticky sauce

Cook for 1-2 min further until the sauce has thickened slightly and has coated everything nicely – this is your sticky chilli beef

### Step 5

Serve the sticky chilli beef over the edamame & jasmine rice

Enjoy!
