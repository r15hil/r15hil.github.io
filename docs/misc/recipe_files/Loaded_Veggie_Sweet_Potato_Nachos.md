Slice the sweet potatoes into discs (as finely as you can!)

Tip: If you're cooking for 4, use 2 trays!

### Step 2

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through and starting to crisp

Meanwhile, peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (as finely as you can!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Drain and rinse the black beans

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Once thickened, mash gently – these are your refried beans

Grate the cheddar cheese

Once the sweet potato discs are cooked, dollop over the refried beans and top with the grated cheese
