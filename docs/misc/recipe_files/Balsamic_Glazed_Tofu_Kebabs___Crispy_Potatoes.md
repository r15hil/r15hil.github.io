## Ingredients

- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 20g rocket
- 1 courgette
- 45g free-from mayonnaise
- 30ml balsamic vinegar 
- 3 white potatoes
- 280g plain tofu
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 15ml white wine vinegar 
- 6 skewers
- 2 red onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into rough bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Top and tail the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the trimmed courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then into half moons

Chop the tofu into 18 <span class="text-danger">[36]</span> cubes

Peel and roughly chop the red onions


### Step 3

Add the tofu cubes, chopped courgette, red onion wedges and cherry tomatoes to a large bowl

Drizzle with vegetable oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a gentle mix up

Thread the chopped veg and tofu cubes onto the soaked skewers, alternating as you go – these are your tofu kebabs


### Step 4

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy

Add the tofu kebabs to a separate lightly oiled baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15-20 min, or until everything has softened and beginning to turn golden


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the balsamic vinegar to a pot with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>cold water

Add the pot to a medium-high heat and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-5 min or until reduced – this is your balsamic glaze


### Step 6

Once the tofu kebabs have had 15-20 min in the oven, drizzle them with the balsamic glaze – these are your balsamic-glazed tofu kebabs

Tip: Brush the glaze onto the kebabs with a pastry brush if you have one!

Return the tray to the oven for 3-5 min or until golden and sticky


### Step 7

Combine the mayo with the white wine vinegar, dried oregano and a pinch of salt – this is your herby mayo

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the balsamic-glazed tofu kebabs with the crispy potatoes and a handful of rocket to the side

Drizzle the rocket lightly with olive oil and serve the herby mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
