Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown

### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, reduce the heat to low and add your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, sesame noodles and a splash of water to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are coated in the sauce – this is your Chinese-style chicken & pepper chow mein

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese-style chicken & pepper chow mein

Enjoy!
