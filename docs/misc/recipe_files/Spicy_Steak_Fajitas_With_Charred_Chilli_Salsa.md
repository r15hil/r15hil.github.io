## Description

In this recipe, you'll be coating your steaks in a spicy chipotle marinade, before searing them to perfection. You'll also make a zingy homemade salsa, with charred chillies, tomatoes and lime. Your wraps are then assembled 'Tex-Mex' style – with onions, peppers and a good dollop of cooling sour cream!

## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 2 tomato
- 1 pot of soured cream (100g)
- 2 x 150g British beef picanha rump steak
- 1 chipotle paste sachet (20g)
- 1 green pepper
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 6 white tortilla wraps
- 1 lime
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a dry, large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once the pan is hot, add the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and cook for 5-6 min or until charred all over then set aside for later


Tip: Open a window or turn your extraction on, as this may get smoky!


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the chipotle paste, smoked paprika, dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground cumin to a large plate with a pinch of salt and 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and stir it all together


Add the rump steaks to the plate and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the spices


### Step 3

Peel and finely slice most of the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and finely dice the rest


Deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 4

Dice the tomatoes finely and add them to the bowl with the diced red onion


Chop the charred red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely (don't like spice? Deseed your chillies!) and add to the same bowl 


Add a drizzle of olive oil and the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your charred chilli salsa


### Step 5

Return the pan to a medium-high with a drizzle of vegetable oil


Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


### Step 6

While the onion and pepper are cooking, heat another large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side


For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side


For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side


Once done, remove them from the pan, finely slice, then add them to the peppers with any juices


### Step 7

Whilst the steaks are cooking, add the tortillas to a plate


Put the plate in the microwave and cook for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve up the tortillas topped with the sliced steak, peppers and onions


Drizzle over the soured cream and charred chilli salsa


Enjoy!
