## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add the grated carrot, champagne lentils and chopped tomatoes to the dish and cook for 30 secs


### Step 4

Meanwhile, trim the green beans, then chop them into bite-sized pieces and add them to the dish


### Step 5

Add the thyme (chuck it in, stalk and all!), dried oregano, roasted garlic paste and balsamic vinegar to the dish

Add a pinch of sugar and the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


### Step 6

Wash the shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Stir in the vegetable stock mix and add 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L] </span>boiled water to the dish

Stir through the macaroni and shredded kale and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 7

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until the macaroni is cooked through and everything's tender – this is your one-pot baked herby minestrone with chilli

### Step 8

To serve, tear the basil leaves into the one-pot baked herby minestrone with chilli and discard the thyme stalks

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and taste for seasoning, adding a pinch of salt and pepper if needed
