- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- British bacon lardons (100g)
- British free range egg x2
- Garlic clove x2
- Chinese rice wine (15ml)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Rocket (20g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g) x0
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the lardons are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the bacon is crispy, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the diced onion and garlic and cook for another 3-4 min or until the onion has softened and lightly caramelised

Tip: Add a small drizzle of vegetable oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 3

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a small drizzle of vegetable oil if your pan is looking a little dry!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half, then add the chopped cherry tomatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Add a drizzle of olive oil, half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of sugar and a crack of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the tomatoes become blistered – these are your balsamic tomatoes

Tip: Crowd the tomatoes together for the best blistering!


### Step 5

Separate the egg yolk[s] from the whites by cracking your egg[s] over a small bowl and catching the yolk in the shell

Transfer the yolk from one shell half to the other several times, until all the whites are in the bowl and you are left with the yolk in the shell

Tip: Hold on to those egg whites! They’re perfect for meringues or a protein-rich omelette (they freeze well too!)


### Step 6

Add most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and the egg yolk[s] to a small bowl

Season with a few generous grinds of black pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a little splash of cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your carbonara sauce


### Step 7

Once the stock is absorbed, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min further then take the risotto off the heat

Add the carbonara sauce and give everything a really good mix up – this is your creamy carbonara risotto

Tip: Mix the sauce through the risotto quickly to avoid scrambling the egg!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the creamy carbonara risotto topped with the balsamic tomatoes and sprinkle the remaining Italian hard cheese all over

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Serve the salad to the side with a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!
