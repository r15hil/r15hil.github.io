## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Add your white long grain rice, diced onion, halved cherry tomatoes and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your tomato rice


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your capers finely


### Step 4

Combine the chopped capers, chopped parsley and remaining chopped garlic with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper – this is your salsa verde


### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, add a handful of flour to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your flour mixture

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the basa fillet[s] to the floured plate and turn several times until they are fully coated – this is your coated basa


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Stir your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste and vegetable stock mix through the tomato rice – this is your sun-dried tomato rice

### Step 8

Serve the pan-fried basa over the sun-dried tomato rice

Drizzle the salsa verde all over

Enjoy!
