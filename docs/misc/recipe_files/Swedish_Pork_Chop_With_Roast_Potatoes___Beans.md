### Step 1

Set the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel the potatoes (chop any large potatoes in half)

Add the peeled potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are done, drain and leave them to steam dry

### Step 2

Add the cooked potatoes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and season generously with salt

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min, turning halfway through or until crispy – these are your roast potatoes

### Step 3

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, pat the pork steaks dry with kitchen paper

Rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned pork steaks and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through

### Step 4

While the steaks are cooking, reboil a kettle

Once done, transfer the cooked pork steaks to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 2 min

Reserve the pan

### Step 5

Add the green beans to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 4-5 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain the green beans

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine the soy sauce, Henderson's Relish and half of the redcurrant jelly (you'll use the rest later!) in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your redcurrant stock

### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium heat, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and stir until sandy (if your pan is looking dry add a small knob of butter)

Whisk the redcurrant stock into the flour and cook for 2-3 min until the stock has thickened slightly

Add the clotted cream and cook for 1 min further

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your redcurrant gravy

### Step 8

Serve the rested pork steaks with the roast potatoes, cooked green beans and remaining redcurrant jelly to the side

Pour over the redcurrant gravy

Enjoy!
