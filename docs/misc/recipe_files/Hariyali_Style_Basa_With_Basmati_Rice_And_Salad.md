Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Chop the remaining green chilli[es] roughly

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stems

Pick your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

### Step 3

Add the chopped chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garlic and ginger to a food processor with your ground cumin, garam masala, mango chutney and the juice of half your lemon[s]

Add the mint leaves, chopped coriander and your natural yoghurt with a generous pinch of salt

Blitz until smooth – this is your Hariyali-style marinade

### Step 4

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it roughly

Combine the chopped tomato[es] and shredded lettuce in a large bowl and set aside for serving – this is your salad

In a separate bowl, combine the juice of the remaining lemon with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your zingy lemon dressing

### Step 6

Chop your basa fillet[s] into strips

Season the chopped basa with a generous pinch of salt

Add the seasoned basa to a bowl with the Hariyali-style marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated basa

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1600417195618-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated basa to the pan (along with any remaining hariyali marinade from the bowl!) and cook for 8-9 min or until cooked through, turning once halfway – this is your Hariyali-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the Hariyali-style basa with any cooked Hariyali-style marinade from the pan over the basmati rice with the salad to the side

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and drizzle the salad with the zingy lemon dressing

Enjoy!
