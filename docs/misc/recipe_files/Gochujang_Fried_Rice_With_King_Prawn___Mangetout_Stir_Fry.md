### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into thin batons

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the carrot batons and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat and add your cooked white long grain rice

Tip: Be careful – the rice will sizzle from the heat of the oil!

Return the pan to the heat and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Once the carrot has slightly softened, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add your mangetout to the pan with half your sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!)

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce with 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Drain and add your king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your king prawn & mangetout stir-fry

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1681918812394-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

While the prawns are cooking, add your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the rice with a pinch of sugar and mix until completely combined

Cook for 2-3 min further or until slightly crispy on the bottom – this is your gochujang fried rice

### Step 8

Serve the gochujang fried rice with the king prawn & mangetout stir-fry to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
