### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato[es] to a bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 2

Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Once the sweet potato is fork-tender, drain any excess water and mash until smooth

Once smooth, add the chopped basa with your vegetable stock mix, half your peri peri spice mix (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and mix it all together – this is your fish cake mixture

### Step 4

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with a generous drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper

Divide the fish cake mixture equally and shape into 1 fish cake per person, then press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat – this is your peri peri-spiced fish cake[s]

Add the peri peri-spiced fish cake[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your mayo with the remaining peri peri spice mix (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your peri peri mayo

### Step 6

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

### Step 7

Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your blanched peas and chopped mint with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min further or until they're warmed through – these are your spicy peas

### Step 8

Serve the peri peri-spiced fish cake with the chips, spicy peas and peri peri mayo to the side

Enjoy!
