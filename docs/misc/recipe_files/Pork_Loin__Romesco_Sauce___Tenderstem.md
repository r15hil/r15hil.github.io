Romesco sauce is a sweet and sour, thick, smoky red pepper salsa that originates from sunny Catalonia, a little bit like pesto but less salty. We're serving ours alongside juicy pork tenderloin, crushed baby potatoes and vibrant Tenderstem broccoli.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the&nbsp;red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Add the&nbsp;pepper, tomato wedges and peeled garlic to a baking tray, drizzle with&nbsp;olive oil, then&nbsp;put in the oven for 20 min until softened&nbsp;

Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar,&nbsp;a generous pinch of both salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up - this is your romesco sauce

Once melted, add the drained potatoes and a generous pinch of both salt and pepper


Lightly crush them with a masher or fork, being careful not to mash them&nbsp;fully and cook for 3-5 min or until they're just starting to crisp
