### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>brown onion, then grate the rest

Dissolve half the chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and add the sultanas – this is your sultana stock

### Step 2

Combine the lean beef mince in a large bowl with the grated onion, panko breadcrumbs, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the ground cumin (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Divide the mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span> and shape into meatballs

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef meatballs to the pan and cook for 4-5 min until browned all over

Once browned, transfer the browned meatballs to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 4

Whilst the meatballs are browning, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

### Step 5

Whilst the onion is softening, trim the green beans and chop them in half

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Once the onion has softened, add the ground coriander and the remaining ground cumin and cook for a further 30 secs

Add the chopped tomatoes and sultana stock, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the remaining chicken stock mix into a pot with 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Add the bulgur wheat and chickpeas to the pot and reduce the heat to very low

Cook, covered, for 15 min or until all of the water has been absorbed and the bulgur is cooked through

### Step 7

Return the browned meatballs to the pan, add the halved green beans and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy lean beef meatball & green bean tagine

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Once the bulgur is cooked, add the chopped parsley (save some for garnish) to the bulgur with a grind of black pepper and mix together – this is your parsley & chickpea bulgur

Serve the spicy lean beef meatball & green bean tagine over the parsley & chickpea bulgur

Garnish with the remaining parsley

Enjoy!
