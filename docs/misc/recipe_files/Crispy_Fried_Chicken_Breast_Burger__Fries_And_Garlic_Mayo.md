### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crispy

### Step 2

While the fries are in the oven, cut your chicken breast portion[s] into strips

Add the chicken strips, soy sauce and your ground smoked paprika to a bowl and give everything a good mix up then set aside

Add your cornflour and dried oregano to a shallow plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix well – this is your herby flour mix

### Step 3

Remove the chicken strips from the bowl and firmly press each one into the herby flour mix, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – these are your coated chicken strips

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken strips and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy fried chicken

### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Dice your tomato[es] finely

### Step 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!) with your mayo, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your garlic mayo

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a separate bowl – this is your salad dressing

### Step 8

To assemble your burger, spread your garlic mayo on the warmed brioche base, then top with some shredded lettuce, the crispy fried chicken and a warmed brioche lid

Serve the fries, diced tomato and remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the salad dressing over the tomato and lettuce

Enjoy!
