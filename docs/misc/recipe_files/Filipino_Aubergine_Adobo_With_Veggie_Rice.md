## Ingredients

- 80g fine green beans
- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 1 red chilli
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 30ml soy sauce
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 1 spring onion
- 3 garlic cloves
- 2 aubergines
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalks off the aubergines and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the aubergine has softened


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

While the onion softens, chop the green beans in half


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, reduce the heat to medium-low

Add the bay leaves, chopped garlic, soy sauce and 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced slightly


### Step 5

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

When the rice is boiling, add the Tenderstem broccoli and halved green beans and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your veggie rice


### Step 6

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Finely slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 7

Once the sauce has reduced, add the cider vinegar, chopped ginger and roasted aubergine to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 5-6 min or until everything's nicely coated

Season the with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Filipino aubergine adobo

### Step 8

Serve the Filipino aubergine adobo with the veggie rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
