## Ingredients

- 150g spinach
- 160g arborio rice 
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 30g pecan nuts
- 2 shallots
- 4 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle and wash the spinach in a colander


Peel and chop the shallots finely


Peel and grate (or chop) the garlic cloves


Dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> with 800ml<span class="text-danger"> (1.4L)</span> of boiled water


Re-boil the kettle (for step 2)


### Step 2

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) on a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of olive oil


When hot, add the shallot with a pinch of salt, then cook on a medium low heat for 2 min, until softened but not coloured


Meanwhile, pour the boiled water over the spinach in the colander so that it wilts (leaving to cool until step 7)


### Step 3

Add the rice and 2/3 of the garlic to the shallot pan and mix well


Add 1/3 of the stock to the rice and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until the stock is absorbed


Continue to add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 15-20 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat another wide-based pan on a medium heat


When hot, add the pecan nuts and cook for 5 min, or until slightly darkened in colour


Once toasted, transfer to a pestle and mortar (or processor) and reserve the pan for step 5


Meanwhile, cut the mushrooms into 1/2cm thick slices


### Step 5

Place the reserved pan on a medium high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of olive oil


When hot, add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt


Cook them on either side for 3 min, or until golden and caramelised


Tip: Do this in batches as overcrowding prevents proper browning


### Step 6

Add the remaining garlic, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(6 tbsp)</span> of olive oil (preferably extra virgin) and a large pinch of salt to the pestle and mortar (or processor) with the nuts


Tip: Omit the raw garlic if you're not keen on that strong flavour


Bash in a pestle and mortar (or blitz) until you have a coarse nutty oil


### Step 7

Squeeze the excess moisture out of the cooled spinach over the sink


Chop the spinach finely


Add the wilted spinach to the risotto and stir through thoroughly

### Step 8

Stir in half the pecan oil, reserving the rest for garnish


Season the risotto with salt and pepper to your taste


Serve the risotto with the mushrooms on top and the pecan oil drizzled over


Enjoy!
