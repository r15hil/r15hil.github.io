## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar 
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 1 courgette
- 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard 
- 4 Cumberland sausages
- 1 honey pot (28g)
- 300g potatoes
- 1 spring onion 
- 4 skewers
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (26ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 230&deg;C/ 210&deg;C (fan)/ 450&deg;F/ Gas 8, then soak the skewers in water (to prevent them from burning)


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


Add the potatoes to a baking tray, drizzle with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper


### Step 2

Put the potatoes in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are nicely browned


Meanwhile, top and tail the&nbsp;courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and slice into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> discs


&nbsp;


### Step 3

Assemble&nbsp;the kebabs


Thread a sausage onto each skewer, add a tomato to each end of each skewer


Top and tail with a slice of courgette (see picture)


### Step 4

Add the kebabs to a lightly oiled baking tray (use tin foil to avoid a mess!)


Add any leftover cherry tomatoes to the tray then season the vegetables (not the sausages) with a small pinch of salt and pepper


Put the tray in the oven&nbsp;for 20min or until the sausages are nicely browned and cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Grate the cheese


### Step 6

Mix together the mustard, honey and mayonnaise with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your dipping sauce


### Step 7

Once browned, remove the potatoes from the oven and scatter the cheese and spring onions over


Return the tray to the oven for 1 min, or until the&nbsp;cheese has melted&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the kebabs with the dipping sauce and cheesy potatoes to the side


Enjoy!
