### Step 1

Before you begin...


Get all your ingredients and equipment ready


Skim through these steps


Wash your fruit and veg


Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!


Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the diced chicken with a pinch of salt and the ginger &amp; garlic paste and cook for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, add the fine egg noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water then set aside until they're completely drained
