- British rump pavé steak (300g)
- Ciabatta x2
- Garlic clove
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Brown onion
- White potato x3
- Horseradish sauce (20g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s], then heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 20 min, stirring frequently or until softened and golden


### Step 2

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 3

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your horseradish and mayo in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your horseradish mayo


### Step 5

Once the onions are golden, add the chopped garlic to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later) and cook for a further 3-4 min or until caramelised – these are your balsamic onions

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper on both sides


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board


### Step 7

While the steak is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted and charred

### Step 8

To build, spread a dollop of horseradish mayo on the toasted ciabatta base, then top with a handful of salad, sliced steak and balsamic onions

Top with a toasted lid and serve with the chips and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining balsamic vinegar over the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
