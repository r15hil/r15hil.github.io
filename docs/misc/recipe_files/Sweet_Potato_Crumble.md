## Description

This crumble-bake is a basically a quick-cook gratin. The innards are made from mild-curried sweet potato and lentils; cooked on the stove until softened. It’s dotted with sharp feta, which softens while it bakes, and topped off with a wholesome toasty oat n’ pumpkin seed topping and a side of leeks.
