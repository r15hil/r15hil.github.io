### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 230°C/ 210°C (fan)/ gas 8 and boil half a kettle

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into thick wedges

Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!), skin-side down, drizzle with vegetable oil, and season generously with salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until crispy

### Step 2

Whilst the wedges are cooking, peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, garlic and a pinch of salt, and cook for 3 min or until the onion has softened, then add your curry powder and cook for 1 min further

### Step 4

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10-15 min or until it thickens to resemble a pasta sauce-like consistency

While the sauce thickens, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Add the cannellini beans to the sauce, reduce the heat to low and warm through until you're ready to serve – these are your Indian-style beans

### Step 5

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 6

Check the sweet potato wedges are crispy (you don't want to move onto the egg until your wedges are done!)

### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until cooked to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

### Step 8

Serve the fried egg over the Indian-style beans with the sweet potato wedges to the side

Garnish with your nigella seeds and chopped coriander

Enjoy!
