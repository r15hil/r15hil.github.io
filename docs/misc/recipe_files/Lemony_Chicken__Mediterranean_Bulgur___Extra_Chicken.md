## Ingredients

- Red onion
- British chicken breast portion
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Garlic clove
- Cherry tomatoes (125g) x0
- Parsley (5g)
- Cherry tomatoes (250g)
- Bulgur wheat (130g)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and chopped onion to a baking tray (or two!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until the vegetables have softened and are beginning to char – these are your roasted vegetables


### Step 3

While the onion and tomatoes are cooking, add your bulgur wheat and your chicken stock mix with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water to a pot with a matching lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook, covered for 7-9 min or until almost all the water has absorbed

Once done, remove the pot from the heat, fluff with a fork and set aside until later


### Step 4

Add your chicken breast portions to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken


### Step 5

Combine the juice of your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, your dried oregano, half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herb marinade

Dip the butterflied chicken in the herb marinade


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken (cooking for 4 or more? Do this in batches!) and cook for 4 min on each side until golden and almost cooked

Once the chicken is almost cooked add the remaining herb marinade to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), then once done, transfer to a clean chopping board and set aside to rest – this is your lemony chicken


### Step 7

Roughly chop your cucumber and add to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tzatziki

Add the roasted vegetables and chopped parsley to the cooked bulgur and give it a good mix up – this is your Mediterranean-style veg bulgur

### Step 8

Slice the lemony chicken

Serve the sliced lemony chicken over the Mediterranean-style veg bulgur with the tzatziki on the side

Enjoy!
