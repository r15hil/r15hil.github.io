### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span> in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your cherry tomatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray, then scrunch the sides up to create a parcel

Add your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

### Step 2

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15 min or until softened

Once softened, remove the tray from the oven and set aside to cool in the tin foil parcel – these are your roasted tomatoes

### Step 3

While the tomatoes are roasting, peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine the grated garlic and 1/3 of your soft cheese (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl with your tomato paste, half your dried oregano, 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and a small pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy tomato sauce

### Step 4

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain your mozzarella, pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into small bite-sized pieces

Grate your Italian hard cheese

### Step 5

Remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and add your pizza bases

Divide the creamy tomato sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the grated cheddar, grated Italian hard cheese and torn mozzarella

Dollop the remaining soft cheese evenly on top, then sprinkle the remaining dried oregano all over

### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your four-cheese pizzas

### Step 7

While the pizzas are cooking, remove the base of your lettuce

Wash the lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves

### Step 8

Serve the four-cheese pizza with the lettuce leaves to the side

Top the salad with the roasted tomatoes and drizzle the tomato juices all over

Garnish the pizza with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!
