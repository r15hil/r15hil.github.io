## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Add your cashew nuts to a large baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 6-8 min or until the cashews are lightly toasted, then transfer to a plate and reserve the tray for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks, keeping the stems and leaves separate

Cut your red pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) then chop into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add your beef mince to a large bowl with the chopped spring onions, diced apricots, chopped parsley stems, half of the harissa paste (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands, then divide and shape into meatballs (3 per person!)


### Step 4

Add the meatballs to one side of your reserved baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add the chopped red pepper to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pepper has softened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and the remaining harissa paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a large heatproof bowl

Add your couscous, cover and set aside until all of the stock has absorbed


### Step 6

Add your cultured coconut to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Chop the roasted cashew nuts coarsely (only once they are cool enough to handle!)


### Step 7

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork, season with a grind of black pepper and mix most of the chopped parsley leaves through (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Once done, add the roasted red pepper to the couscous and give it a good mix up – this is your red pepper couscous

### Step 8

Serve the harissa beef meatballs over the red pepper couscous with the seasoned cultured coconut dotted over

Garnish with the chopped cashew nuts and reserved parsley leaves

Enjoy!
