### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min] </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, oven-proof casserole dish with a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges and crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Add the onion wedges to the dish with the crushed garlic and cook for 1-2 min

Whilst the onion and garlic is cooking, drain and rinse the black beans

### Step 4

Add the ground allspice and ground cumin to the dish with the white long grain rice, drained black beans and remaining thyme (including the stalks!) then add the chicken stock mix and the creamed coconut to the dish with 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and mix everything together

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper then bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-2-1688725535523-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Add half the thyme (stalks and all!) to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray and top with the chicken breast portions

Drizzle with vegetable oil and sprinkle over the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Caribbean-style spiced chicken

### Step 6

Once the chicken has been in the oven for 5 min, cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the spinach to the middle with a few small knobs of butter, a generous grind of black pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the spinach to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> then add to the other side of the baking tray with the chicken for the remaining 5-7 min

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-2-1650388388201-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Remove the dish from the oven and add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, then set aside for 5 min to steam (keep the lid on!) – this is your 'rice & peas'

### Step 8

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Caribbean-style spiced chicken over the 'rice & peas' with the spinach to the side (discard the thyme stems!)

Drizzle any remaining chicken juices over the top and squeeze the juice from the lime wedges over the rice

Enjoy!
