## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly


### Step 2

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 3

Mix the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and spring onion together and chop them until you are left with a finely chopped mixture – this is your chilli & spring onion mixture


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chilli & spring onion mixture to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until it begins to soften

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan along with the chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through


### Step 5

While the prawns are cooking, cut your lemon[s] in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 6

Once the prawns are cooked, add the drained linguine to the pan with a couple of splashes of the reserved starchy pasta water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon and stir until the sauce sticks to the linguine – this is your king prawn, garlic & chilli linguine


### Step 7

Remove from the heat and stir through the chopped parsley

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and chopped tomatoes to a bowl with a little drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad

### Step 8

Serve the king prawn, garlic & chilli linguine in bowls with the tomato salad

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with plenty of black pepper

Enjoy!
