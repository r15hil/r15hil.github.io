### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Carefully pull the chicken skin off your chicken thighs

Add the chicken skin to a baking paper-lined baking tray and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 3

Place another piece of baking paper over the chicken skin, then a second baking tray on top to weigh it down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken skin is golden and crispy – this is your crispy chicken skin

Boil a kettle

### Step 5

Whilst the chicken is browning, top, tail and chop your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

### Step 7

After an initial 10 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese

Add your macaroni with your shredded kale, a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper, then cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for a further 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, use two forks to shred the chicken apart and stir through your crème fraîche – this is your creamy chicken soup with macaroni

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken soup with macaroni in a bowl, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with the crispy chicken skin

Enjoy!
