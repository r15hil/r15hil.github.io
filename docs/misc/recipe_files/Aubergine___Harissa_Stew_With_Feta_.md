Heat a wok or small pan with 3-5 tbsp olive oil over a medium heat&nbsp;


### Step 6

Once hot, add the sliced garlic (separating them as you go) and cook until crispy and slightly golden


Transfer the fried garlic to the kitchen paper (keep the oil for later) and sprinkle them with salt


### Step 7

Strip the mint leaves from the stems and chop finely


Fluff the couscous with a fork, add a drizzle of the garlic oil and mix through


&nbsp;

### Step 8
