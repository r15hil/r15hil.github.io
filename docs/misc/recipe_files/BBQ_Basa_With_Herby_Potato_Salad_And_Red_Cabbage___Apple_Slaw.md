## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 40g BBQ sauce
- 150g shredded red cabbage
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 3 white potatoes
- 10g dill & chives
- 1 carrot
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 1 apple
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-10 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper

Add the basa fillets to a bowl with the BBQ sauce and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together so the basa fillets are fully coated in BBQ sauce, then set aside to marinate


### Step 3

Slice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into discs

Slice each individual apple disc into matchsticks

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Trim, then slice the spring onions


### Step 4

Chop the chives finely

Chop the dill finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Combine the apple matchsticks, grated carrot and chopped chives in a large bowl with the shredded red cabbage

Add the mayo and white wine vinegar with a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your red cabbage & apple slaw


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated basa fillets and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until charred on the outside and cooked through – this is your BBQ basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Meanwhile, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter

Add the chopped dill and sliced spring onions to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ basa with the herby potato salad and red cabbage & apple slaw to the side

Enjoy!
