## Ingredients

- 1 vegetable stock mix sachet (11g)
- 190g linguine
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 35g Italian hard cheese
- 400g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 10g chives
- 30g capers
- 30g pitted black olives
- 50g rocket
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large pot (big enough to fit all your ingredients inside and with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of sugar and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until softened but not coloured


### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Slice the black olives finely

Grate the Italian hard cheese

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Add 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water to the softened onions and stir in the veg stock mix

Increase the heat to high and bring to the boil


### Step 4

Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to medium and add the linguine (you can break it in half if it doesn't fit)

Add the chopped tomatoes, chopped garlic, capers, sliced olives and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Tip: Push the pasta into the liquid fully, so it cooks!


### Step 5

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous amount of black pepper

Cover with a lid and cook for 5-8 min or until the linguine is cooked

Tip: Keep checking that the linguine has not stuck to the base of the pot and stir if needed


### Step 6

Once the linguine is cooked, remove the lid and stir continuously for 3-5 min or until a sauce forms, adding more water if it looks too dry

Tip: Stirring the sauce releases the starch from the pasta making it naturally creamier


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the chives finely

Once done, remove the cooked linguine and sauce from the heat and stir in half of the chopped chives and half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) – this is your puttanesca

### Step 8

Serve the puttanesca with the rocket to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives, remaining Italian hard cheese and a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!
