### Step 7

Trim and slice your spring onions finely

Wash your salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the sliced spring onion, chopped mint, baked feta and half of the salad – this is your feta & mint shoot risotto

Serve the feta & mint shoot risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining salad

Season with a crack of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!
