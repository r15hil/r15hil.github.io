### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown

### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and cornflour in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and crème fraîche – this is your creamy stock

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add your dried thyme and roasted garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy stock to the pan with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil

Season with a very generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened

### Step 6

Squeeze the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained cannellini beans and spinach to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your French-style mustard & garlic chicken

### Step 8

Serve the French-style mustard & garlic chicken over the cooked brown rice

Enjoy!
