### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free chicken and cook for 5-6 min or until brown all over, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later

### Step 2

Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-9 min or until softened

### Step 5

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a baking tray with half the chopped garlic, half the lemon zest (save the rest for later!), the chopped parsley, grated Italian hard cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until golden – this is your cheesy crumb

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the creamy lemon meat-free chicken linguine in bowls and sprinkle generously with the cheesy crumb
