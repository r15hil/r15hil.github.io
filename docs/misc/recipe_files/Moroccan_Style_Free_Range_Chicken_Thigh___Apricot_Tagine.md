### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside

### Step 2

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set them aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped ginger and garlic, diced apricots and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until the garlic has softened, then add the chicken strips and cook for a further 3-4 min

Add your chopped tomato, pepper rounds, chicken stock and the juice of half your lemon[s] and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Moroccan-style free range chicken thigh & apricot tagine

### Step 7

Whilst the tagine is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Fluff the couscous with a fork and add the remaining lemon juice

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and half the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!) and mix everything together – this is your herby couscous

Stir the remaining chopped parsley through the Moroccan-style free range chicken thigh & apricot tagine

### Step 8

Serve the Moroccan-style free range chicken thigh & apricot tagine with the herby couscous to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!
