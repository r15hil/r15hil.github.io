### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Roll into bite-sized meatballs

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your sausage meatballs and cook for 5-6 min or until they're browned all over

### Step 3

Meanwhile, slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate!) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and soft cheese in 125ml<span class="text-purple"> [175ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[225ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy chicken stock

### Step 4

Once the sausage meatballs are brown, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan along with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 7-8 min or until soft

Once soft, add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 5

While the mushrooms are cooking, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the creamy chicken stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once thickened, stir through the cooked linguine and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy sausage & mushroom linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 7

Add your white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil to a large bowl along with a pinch of salt

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper then add it to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sausage & mushroom linguine with the dressed salad to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
