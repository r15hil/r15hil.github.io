While the chorizo is cooking, add the gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water

### Step 7

Tip: Add a splash of starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Set the creamy chorizo gnocchi in the centre of the table, ready to share

Top with the grated Italian hard cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
