## Ingredients

- Tahini (15g)
- British free range chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Sushi rice (75g) x0
- Cornflour (1tsp)
- Apple
- Sushi rice (150g)
- Garlic clove
- Rice vinegar (15ml)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Carrot x2
- Mangetout (80g)
- Soy sauce (30ml)
- Soy sauce (15ml) x0
- Red chilli
- Honey (25g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side

Once the chicken has browned, add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), tahini, mayo, and rice vinegar in a large bowl

Season with pepper – this is your Japanese-style dressing


### Step 5

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your mangetout in half lengthways

Slice your apple[s] finely, discard the core then chop into matchsticks

Add the grated carrot, apple matchsticks and halved mangetout to the Japanese-style dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your Japanese-style slaw


### Step 6

Combine your cornflour with your soy sauce and honey in a small bowl – this is your soy glaze


### Step 7

Once the chicken is cooked, add the soy glaze to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is fully coated

Transfer the soy-glazed free range chicken to a clean board and slice finely

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced soy-glazed free range chicken over the sticky sushi rice with the Japanese-style slaw to the side

Drizzle any remaining soy glaze from the pan over the chicken and garnish with the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
