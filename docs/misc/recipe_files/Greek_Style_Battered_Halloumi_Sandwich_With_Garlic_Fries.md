## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Peel and grate your garlic


### Step 2

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your dried oregano, grated garlic and half your smoked paprika (save the rest for later!)

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until well coated

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your garlic fries


### Step 3

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Add the sliced shallot to a large bowl with half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot


### Step 4

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then into chunks

Remove 1 outer leaf per person from your lettuce and set aside, shred the inner core

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds


### Step 5

Combine your cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour in a bowl with the remaining smoked paprika and the remaining red wine vinegar

Add 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk to the bowl and whisk everything together until there are no lumps – this is your batter

Slice your halloumi into 3 strips per person and sprinkle both sides with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil, over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, dip the sliced halloumi into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated, then add the coated halloumi to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crispy – this is your battered halloumi


### Step 7

Add your pitta bread[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Add the shredded lettuce, chopped cucumber and half your natural yoghurt to the bowl with the quick-pickled shallot

Mix everything together – this is your yoghurt & cucumber salad

Combine the remaining natural yoghurt with the mustard ketchup in a bowl – this is your yellow sauce

### Step 8

To build your sandwich, slice open the warmed pitta and fill it with a dollop of yellow sauce, 2 tomato rounds, a outer lettuce leaf and 3 battered halloumi slices – this is your Greek-style battered halloumi sandwich

Serve the yoghurt & cucumber salad and garlic fries to the side with the remaining yellow sauce

Enjoy!
