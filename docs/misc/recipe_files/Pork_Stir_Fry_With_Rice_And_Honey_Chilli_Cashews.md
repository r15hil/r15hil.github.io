### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

### Step 5

Once slightly toasted, add the remaining honey to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until caramelised

Once caramelised, transfer the cashew nuts to a plate to cool into a brittle and reserve the pan – these are your honey chilli cashews

Once softened, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the chopped garlic and ginger paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the stir fry sauce and cook for a further 4 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop your cooled honey chilli cashews roughly

### Step 8

Serve the pork stir fry next to the cooked rice

Garnish with the chopped honey chilli cashews
