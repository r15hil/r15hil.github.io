- Ground paprika (1tsp)
- Red pepper
- Sausage meat (150g)
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Red onion
- Black beans (390g) x1
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Chicken stock mix (11g)
- Chicken stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Coriander (5g)

- Farfalle (100g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Drain and rinse your black beans


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> starchy pasta water

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!


### Step 5

Once the sausage meat has started to brown, add 3/4 of the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!), the diced pepper and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once slightly softened, add your ground cumin, ground paprika and ground coriander with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans with your chopped tomatoes and chicken stock mix

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the drained farfalle to the pan with the reserved starchy pasta water and stir it all together


### Step 7

Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish and top with the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy sausage & pepper chilli con carne pasta bake

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy sausage & pepper chilli con carne pasta bake with the chopped coriander and reserved diced onion sprinkled over the top

Season with a grind of black pepper
