### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Slice your flat white mushroom[s] thickly

Chop half your spring onion[s] finely

Slice the remaining spring onion into batons and cut in half lengthways

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushroom with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the egg from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled egg[s], then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg to the bowl

Tip: Use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!

Set the pot of boiled water aside (you'll use this later!)

### Step 4

Reboil a full kettle

Once the mushrooms are golden, reduce the heat to medium and add half your ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

### Step 6

While the spring onion is softening, add your medium egg noodles to the reserved pot of water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside

### Step 7

Pour 600ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[800ml] </span>[1L] </span>boiled water carefully into the pan and add your vegetable stock mix, soy sauce and remaining ginger & garlic paste

Add the spring onion batons, a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 min – this is your noodle broth

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut in half

### Step 8

Serve the drained egg noodles in bowls and pour in the noodle broth – this is your spring onion noodle soup

Top the spring onion noodle soup with the pan-fried mushroom and halved egg and drizzle over your toasted sesame oil

Enjoy!
