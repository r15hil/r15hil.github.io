## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Mango chutney (20g)
- Curry powder (1tbsp)
- Curry powder (0.5tbsp) x0
- Cumin seeds (1tsp)
- Ciabatta x2
- Paneer (200g)
- White potato x3
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- British free range egg
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your cumin seeds and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your cumin chips


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Combine the sliced shallot and red wine vinegar in a bowl with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a small pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot


### Step 3

Slice your paneer in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

Sprinkle half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) over the sliced paneer – this is your spiced paneer

Slice your ciabattas in half


### Step 4

Crack your egg[s] into a wide bowl and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk and the remaining curry powder

Give everything a good mix up – this is your egg mixture

Dip the halved ciabatta, cut side down, into the egg mixture until it's been absorbed by the bread – this is your curried ciabatta


### Step 5

To build your french toast toastie, place a curried ciabatta base, cut side down

Top with the spiced paneer and then the curried ciabatta lid, cut side up – this is your french toast toastie


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the french toast toastie and cook for 3-4 min on each side, pressing them down with a spatula until golden and crisp – this is your spiced paneer french toast


### Step 7

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Combine the quick-pickled shallot and the pickling liquid with the sliced cucumber, shredded lettuce and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your quick-pickled shallot salad

Add your mayo to a bowl with your mango chutney and give it a good mix up – this is your mango mayo

### Step 8

Slice the spiced paneer french toast in half

Serve the sliced french toast with the cumin chips, quick-pickled shallot salad and mango mayo to the side

Enjoy!
