## Ingredients

- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- British lamb mince (250g)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g) x0
- Beef stock mix (11g)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- White potato x4
- Carrot x2
- Marmite (8g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons 

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix, Henderson's Relish, Marmite and tomato paste in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[290ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [380ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add your lamb mince to the pan with a pinch of salt, increase the heat to high and cook for 3-4 min further or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the stock with a grind of pepper and cook for 5-6 min further, or until the sauce has thickened and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lamb mixture


### Step 5

Whilst the lamb mixture is cooking, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth


### Step 6

Add the carrot batons to a large piece of tin foil with a knob of butter, a grind of black pepper and a splash of water

Scrunch the foil around the carrots to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender – these are your buttered carrots


### Step 7

Add the lamb mixture to an oven-proof dish and evenly top with the mashed potato

Tip: Gently run a fork over the mash to create a crispy top!

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your shepherd's pie

### Step 8

Leave the shepherd's pie to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the shepherd's pie with the buttered carrots to the side

Enjoy!
