## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle and soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] lengthways into 2 strips per person, then chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!) and combine with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 2

Combine your curry powder with a drizzle of the coconut stock (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl

Add the free range chicken strips, mix well and set aside to marinate


### Step 3

Add your peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining coconut stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-low heat

Cook for 15-20 min or until it has reduced to the consistency of a thick custard, stirring occasionally – this is your satay sauce


### Step 4

Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, add it to a separate pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 6

Add the sliced cucumber and sliced spring onion to a mixing bowl with your rice vinegar and a large pinch of salt

Mix well and set aside to marinate – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

Thread each marinated chicken strip onto a soaked skewer in a snake-like fashion


### Step 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the free range chicken skewers to the pan, then cook for 4 min turning frequently until browned all over

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, cover with a lid and cook for a further 6 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked though (no pink meat!) – these are your free range chicken skewers

### Step 8

Serve the free range chicken skewers over the brown rice with the quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the satay sauce all over

Enjoy!
