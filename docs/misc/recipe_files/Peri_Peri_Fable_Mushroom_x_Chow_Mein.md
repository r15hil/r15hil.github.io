## Instructions


### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Combine your Fable pulled mushrooms and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with your dried oregano, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil – these are your coated Fable mushrooms

Once hot, add the coated Fable mushrooms to the pan and cook for 8 min or until slightly charred


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into thick slices

Slice your carrot[s] finely on the diagonal, then slice each carrot disc into matchsticks


### Step 3

Once the mushrooms are slightly charred, add the sliced onion and carrot matchsticks to the pan with a small splash of cold water and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Cook for a further 8 min or until the carrot is tender, breaking the mushrooms up slightly with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut half your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Slice the remaining red chilli finely


### Step 5

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside


### Step 6

Reboil half a kettle

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Combine your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water

Add your soy sauce, white wine vinegar and the juice of half the lemon – this is your peri-peri stock


### Step 7

Once the carrot is tender, add the remaining ground smoked paprika and chopped garlic to the pan with the chopped chilli and spring onions

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the peri-peri stock and cook for 2 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the cooked noodles and give everything a good mix up – this is your peri-peri Fable mushroom chow mein

### Step 8

Serve the peri-peri Fable mushroom chow mein in a bowl

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
