### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 3

Combine your Marmite and 80ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>very cold water in a bowl, stirring continuously until fully combined – this is your Marmite water

Add 60g <span class="text-purple">[90g] </span><span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour to a separate large bowl with half of your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), a generous pinch of salt and the Marmite water

Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no lumps, then set aside for later – this is your batter

### Step 4

Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut each fillet in half on a diagonal

Season the sea bass with a pinch of salt and sprinkle both sides with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Dip the floured sea bass into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated, once the pan is hot, add the coated sea bass to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your battered sea bass

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

While the fish cooks, trim then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain, then return to the pan with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and keep covered until serving – these are your buttery beans

### Step 7

Combine the chopped capers and mayo in a bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt – this is your caper mayo

### Step 8

Serve the battered sea bass alongside the wedges and buttery beans with a dollop of the caper mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!
