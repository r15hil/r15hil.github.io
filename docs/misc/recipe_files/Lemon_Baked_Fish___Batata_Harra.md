### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and slice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin rounds<br /><br />Tip: Slice as finely as you can to avoid undercooked onion!<br /><br />Slice the tomatoes into rounds


Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic<br /><br />Slice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon into rounds then slice the rounds into semi-circles (save the rest for later!)

### Step 3

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a jug with the ground paprika and a generous pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your paprika oil

### Step 4

Add the onion rounds to a baking tray in 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> rows

### Step 5

Pour the paprika oil all over the basa fillets then top with the lemon slices<br /><br />Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through<br /><br />Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 6

Whilst the fish is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat<br /><br />Once hot, add the remaining sliced garlic, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), coriander seeds, drained potatoes and a large pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp

### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the parsley and coriander roughly, including the stalks


Once the potatoes are beginning to crisp, add the juice of the remaining lemon and cook for 2 min further or until fragrant 


Remove the pan from the heat, stir through the chopped herbs and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your batata harra

### Step 8

Serve the lemon baked fish with the batata harra to the side


Drizzle over any remaining juices from the tray<br /><br />Enjoy!
