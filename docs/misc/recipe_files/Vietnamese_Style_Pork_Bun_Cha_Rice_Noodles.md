## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the remaining


### Step 2

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with the chopped garlic, half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix the pork mixture thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 3 patties per person (they don’t have to look perfect)


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the patties and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until browned on both sides and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Meanwhile, squeeze the juice of half your lime[s] into a small bowl

Add your fish sauce, the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar and a splash of water

Stir it all together until the sugar has dissolved – this is your nuoc cham


### Step 5

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your mooli slaw mix to a bowl with half the chopped coriander, half the nuoc cham (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled nuoc cham mooli slaw


### Step 6

Add your rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked with a slight bite, drain the rice noodles and set aside


### Step 7

Once the pork patties are cooked through, add your pho broth paste, ginger & garlic paste and chicken stock mix with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [680ml] </span>boiled water

Cook for 2-3 min – this is your pork bun cha

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the cooked rice noodles in a bowl and top with the pork bun cha

Serve the remaining nuoc cham to the side and drizzle over

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds, chopped mint and remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Serve the quick-pickled nuoc cham mooli slaw to the side and enjoy!
