## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks


### Step 4

Once the potatoes have had an initial 12-15 min, add your Tenderstem broccoli and cherry tomatoes to the tray[s]

Drizzle with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt


### Step 5

Top everything with your salmon fillet[s] (skin-side up!)

Season the skin with a pinch of salt

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 14-15 min or until everything is cooked through and the potatoes are crisp – this is your salmon & veg tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

While everything is cooking, add the chopped basil, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and your flaked almonds to a food processor and blitz until smooth

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Grind everything together in a pestle & mortar!


### Step 7

Add the juice of half your lemon[s], 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt to the food processor and mix it all up – this is your homemade pesto

Cut your remaining lemon into wedge 1 per person

### Step 8

Serve the salmon & veg tray bake with a lemon wedge to the side

Drizzle over the homemade pesto

Enjoy!
