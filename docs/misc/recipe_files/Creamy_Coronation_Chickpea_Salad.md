## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain, return to the pot and set aside for later


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, slice your cucumber finely

Wash the lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove your outer lettuce leaves and tear into large bite-sized pieces

Finely shred the inner core


### Step 3

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Pick your coriander leaves from their stalks and set aside for garnish

Chop the coriander stalks finely


### Step 4

Add your cultured coconut to a large bowl with your mango chutney, chopped coriander stalks, sultanas and the juice of half your lime[s]

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your coronation mix


### Step 5

Combine the juice of the remaining lime with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your lime dressing

Drain and rinse your chickpeas


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained chickpeas with your curry powder and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and fragrant

Once fragrant, add the curried chickpeas to the coronation mix and stir it all together – these are your creamy coronation chickpeas


### Step 7

Add the drained potatoes to a large bowl with the lettuce leaves, shredded lettuce and sliced cucumber

Add the lime dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

### Step 8

Serve the crunchy salad in a bowl

Top with the creamy coronation chickpeas and garnish with the coriander leaves, flaked almonds and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
