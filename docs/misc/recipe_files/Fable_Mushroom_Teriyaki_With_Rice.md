### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until browned, breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go – these are your pulled mushrooms

### Step 3

Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals
