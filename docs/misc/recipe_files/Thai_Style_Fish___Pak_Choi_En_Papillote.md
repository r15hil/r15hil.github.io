- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 25g Thai spice jelly
- 130g basmati rice
- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 20g fried onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ 475°F/ Gas 9


Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut in half


### Step 2

Combine the chopped ginger, toasted sesame oil, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, soy sauce and Thai spice jelly in a bowl – this is your marinade 


Chop the pak choi into quarters lengthways


### Step 3

Cut 2<span class="text-danger"> [4] </span>pieces of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper


Add the sheets of baking paper to a large baking tray (doubling it up prevents any leakages!) 


Lay the pak choi in the middle of the baking paper


Add the basa fillets over the pak choi and season with a pinch of salt 


Sprinkle over the lime zest


### Step 4

Drizzle over the marinade (reserve the bowl for later)


Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the fish to form a sealed parcel


Put the baking tray in the oven for 15 min or until the fish is cooked and the pak choi is tender


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lime into wedges


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks 


Strip the mint leaves from the stalks and chop finely 


Add the chopped herbs to the marinade bowl


### Step 7

Once the fish and pak choi are cooked, transfer to your serving plates


Pour the marinade from the parcel back into the marinade bowl and mix to combine – this is your Thai dressing

### Step 8

Serve the T<span class="text-highlight">hai-style fish</span> and pak choi with the basmati rice and lime wedge to the side


Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and the fried onions


Drizzle over the Thai dressing


Enjoy!
