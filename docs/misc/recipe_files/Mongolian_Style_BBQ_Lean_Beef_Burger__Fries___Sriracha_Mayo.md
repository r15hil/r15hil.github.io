## Ingredients

- 1 brioche style buns
- 0 British lean beef mince (<5% fat)
- 30ml mayonnaise
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 0 cornflour
- 8ml Sriracha hot chilli sauce
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 10ml tomato ketchup
- 160g carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix
- 250g British lean beef mince (<5% fat)
- 15ml soy sauce
- 3 white potatoes
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 0 soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are in the oven, combine your soy sauce, hoisin sauce, tomato ketchup and ginger & garlic paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a bowl – this is your Mongolian-style BBQ marinade


### Step 3

Combine your lean beef mince and half the Mongolian-style BBQ marinade in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide into and shape them into patties, 1 per person – these are your Mongolian-style BBQ patty[ies]


### Step 4

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water to the remaining marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your Mongolian-style BBQ sauce

Combine your carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix with the rice vinegar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your quick-pickled mooli slaw


### Step 5

Sprinkle your cornflour over both sides of the beef patty[ies] and pat down until fully coated – these are your coated patty[ies]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on one side until slightly charred

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!


### Step 6

After 5 min, decrease the heat to medium-high and turn the patties over, then add the Mongolian-style BBQ sauce to the pan

Reserve the bowl

Cook for 5 min further, spooning the sauce over the patty[ies] until thickened to a gravy-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in the reserved bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Slice the brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray with the chips from the oven and add the brioche halves, cut side up, then return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

To assemble top each brioche base with the sriracha mayo, a handful of quick-pickled mooli slaw, a Mongolian-style BBQ beef patty and a little Mongolian-style BBQ sauce then top with a brioche lid

Add any remaining Mongolian-style BBQ sauce to a small pot

Serve the remaining quick-pickled Mooli slaw and chips to the side

Enjoy!
