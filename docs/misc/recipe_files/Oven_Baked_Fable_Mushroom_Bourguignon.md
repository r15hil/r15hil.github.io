### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

Top, tail and cut your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice on the diagonal

Crush your garlic clove open with the side of a knife, remove the skins and chop in half

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the chopped rosemary and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden – these are your rosemary roast potatoes

### Step 7

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

### Step 8

Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Serve the Fable mushroom 'bourguignon' in the middle of the table with the rosemary roast potatoes to the side

Dig in!
