## Ingredients

- 0 British lean beef mince (<5% fat)
- 11g beef stock mix
- 0 white long grain rice
- 2 tomatoes
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 32g tomato paste
- 0 green lentils
- 195g green lentils
- 250g British lean beef mince (<5% fat)
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 100g white long grain rice
- 30g feta
- 2 cardamom pods
- 80g spinach
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Drain and rinse your green lentils


### Step 3

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add your lean beef mince with a generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Once the beef mince has browned, add the crushed cardamom pod[s] with your ground coriander, ground cinnamon, ground allspice, chopped garlic and chopped tomatoes and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes begin to break down


### Step 6

Add the drained green lentils, tomato stock and a generous pinch of salt  to the pan with the beef mince and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened and the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your warming Persian-style lean beef & lentil stew


### Step 7

Whilst the stew is cooking, wash your spinach

Add the spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until the spinach is wilted

### Step 8

Serve the warming Persian-style lean beef & lentil stew over the cooked rice

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Crumble your feta over the top and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
