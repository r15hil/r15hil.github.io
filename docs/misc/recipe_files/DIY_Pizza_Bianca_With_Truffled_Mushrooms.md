## Ingredients

- Pizza base mix (250g)
- Dried yeast (7g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Basil (5g)
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove x2
- Chestnut mushrooms (80g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)
- Truffle flavoured extra virgin olive oil (8ml) x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) to a small bowl with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter and mash with a fork until combined – this is your garlic butter

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Add the sliced mushrooms to a bowl with half of your truffle oil (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and gently mix – these are your truffled mushrooms

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 ball per person

Toss the dough ball[s] in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)


### Step 5

Press the dough ball[s] in the centre and gently push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the pizza rim untouched to form a crust (if the dough rips, just stick it back together!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is slightly smaller than a side plate (you will make them bigger later!) – this is your pizza base[s]

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (or two!) (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


### Step 6

Once hot, carefully add the pizza base[s] to the pan[s], pushing the dough out to the edge to help shape the crust

Add a spoonful of garlic butter to each pizza base and spread it evenly as it starts to melt (be careful of the hot pan!)

Cook the pizza base for 3-4 min or until the crust has started to puff up, then remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and slide the pizza base[s] onto the tray[s]

Tip: To pick up the pizza dough, gently flip it over the back of your hand to stop it ripping!


### Step 7

Repeat this process for the remaining pizza base[s]

Tip: Make sure the pizzas don’t overlap on the tray[s] to avoid raw dough!

Top with the torn mozzarella, truffled mushrooms and grated Italian hard cheese, then drizzle the remaining truffle oil all over and tear the basil leaves (save some for garnish!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your pizza Bianca with truffled mushrooms

### Step 8

Add the salad to a bowl with your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic salad

Scatter your reserved basil leaves over the Pizza Bianca with truffled mushrooms and serve the balsamic salad on top or to the side

Enjoy!
