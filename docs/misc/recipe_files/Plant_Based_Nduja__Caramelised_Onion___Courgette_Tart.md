## Ingredients

- Agave nectar (25g)
- Courgette
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Puff pastry (160g)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Vegan 'Nduja (40g)
- Pine nuts (15g)
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Chives (5g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised


### Step 2

While the onion is softening, chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden

Top, tail and slice half your courgette[s] (you'll use the rest later!) into discs


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>square per person

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry square[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife


### Step 4

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)

Top the pastry square evenly with the caramelised onion and courgette discs and drizzle with a little olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the pastry is golden and the edges have started to puff up


### Step 5

Once the tart[s] has had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and dollop over your plant based ‘Nduja (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), then top with your pine nuts and return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until the pine nuts are golden and the pastry is cooked through

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once cooked through and golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle over the agave – this is your plant-based 'Nduja, caramelised onion & courgette tart


### Step 6

While the tart[s] is cooking, peel lengths off the remaining courgette with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the dressing with the courgette ribbons and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your courgette salad


### Step 7

Chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives with your mayo in a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water – this is your chive mayo

Once the potatoes are crisp and golden, stir them through the chive mayo – this is your potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based 'Nduja, caramelised onion & courgette tart with the courgette salad and potato salad to the side

Enjoy!
