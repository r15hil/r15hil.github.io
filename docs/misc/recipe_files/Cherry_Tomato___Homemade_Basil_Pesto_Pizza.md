Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> large baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Add the tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [10 tbsp] </span>cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 3

Drain the mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Top the pizza bases with the torn mozzarella and the halved cherry tomatoes

Sprinkle over the dried oregano

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your cherry tomato pizzas


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the basil roughly

Add the chopped basil and grated Italian hard cheese to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water and grind to a paste (or blitz in a food processor!)

Add 3 tbsp [6 tbsp] olive oil and mix – this is your homemade basil pesto

Combine the white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper in a separate bowl – this is your dressing
