Boil a full kettle

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisp

### Step 2

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Meanwhile, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 3

Once the chorizo has crisped, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further until starting to soften

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water

Once the tomatoes are soft, add the spinach to the pan with the chicken stock and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until the spinach has wilted

### Step 5

Once the spinach has wilted, add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your Greek cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined

### Step 6

Once the pasta is cooked, add it to the pan with the sauce

Stir everything together and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta â€“ this is your Greek cheese, chorizo & spinach tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little thick!

### Step 7

Garnish with the chopped basil and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!
