## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 1 tomato paste
- 160g arborio rice
- 1 raw peeled king prawns
- 32g tomato paste
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 171g raw peeled king prawns
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 vegetable stock mix
- 2 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 5g parsley
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red pepper
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips, sliced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 8-10 min or until softened


### Step 3

Once softened, add your ground turmeric, ground smoked paprika and tomato paste

Add your arborio rice and stir to fully coat the grains and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[700ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water, then add to the pan

Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to low

Cook, covered, for an initial 20-25 min or until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid


### Step 5

After 20-25 min, drain, then add your king prawns and cook covered for a further 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through


### Step 6

Meanwhile, cut your lemon[s] into quarters

Combine a squeeze of lemon juice with your mayo and a good grind of black pepper – this is your lemon aioli

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Once the prawns are cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and add the juice of half the lemon quarter[s] and half of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and season with plenty of pepper – this is your king prawn paella

### Step 8

Drizzle the lemon aioli over the king prawn paella

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and remaining lemon quarters to the side

Enjoy!
