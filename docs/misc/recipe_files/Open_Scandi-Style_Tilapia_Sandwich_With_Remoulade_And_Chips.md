### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Once hot, add the ciabatta halves, cut-side-down and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted

Once toasted, transfer the ciabatta to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough oil to coat the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the breaded tilapia and cook for 4-5 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Top the toasted ciabatta halves with the lettuce leaves, a dollop of remoulade and the golden tilapia – this is your open Scandi-style tilapia sandwich

Serve the open Scandi-style tilapia sandwich with the chips and any remaining remoulade to the side

Enjoy!
