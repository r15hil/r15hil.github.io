### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Tear off pieces of your beef mince, roughly shape into small meatballs (about 6 per person!) and add directly to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli into thirds

### Step 3

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with a lid with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add your chopped broccoli to a sieve and place the sieve over the potatoes

Cover with a lid and cook for 12-15 min or until the potatoes and broccoli are fork-tender

Once the meatballs have browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the sliced onion

Cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Give everything a good mix up until the meatballs are well coated

### Step 6

Once well coated, add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid

Cook for a final 10-11 min, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your saucy onion gravy beef meatballs

### Step 7

Once the potatoes are tender, set aside the steamed broccoli and drain the potatoes

Return the drained potatoes to the pot with a small knob of butter, a splash of milk and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash roughly – these are your crushed potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the saucy onion gravy beef meatballs with the crushed potatoes and steamed broccoli to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
