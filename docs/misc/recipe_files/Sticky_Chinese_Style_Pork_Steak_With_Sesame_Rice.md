## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, wash, then trim the base from your pak choi, then separate the individual leaves and discard the base[s]

Trim your spring onion[s], then cut each spring onion into thirds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub the pork loin steak[s] with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the steak[s] and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Once done, transfer the cooked pork loin steak[s] to a clean chopping board or plate, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest until serving

Reserve the pan for the next step


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves, chopped spring onion and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until both are softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with your toasted sesame oil and cook for 1 min further – this is your sesame pak choi & spring onions


### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a second pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-low heat

Once hot, add your soy sauce, hoisin sauce and maple syrup and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened to a sticky consistency – this is your sticky sauce


### Step 7

Once sticky, remove the pan from the heat and add the rested pork steak[s]

Turn the pork steak[s] in the sticky sauce until fully coated – these are your sticky Chinese-style pork steak

Slice the sticky Chinese-style pork steak finely into strips on a clean board

Add your black sesame seeds to the cooked rice and fluff with a fork – this is your sesame rice

### Step 8

Serve the sliced sticky Chinese-style pork steak over the sesame rice and drizzle with any remaining sticky sauce

Serve the sesame pak choi & spring onions to the side

Enjoy!
