## Ingredients

- 1 red chilli
- 4tbsp cornflour
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 25g red chilli relish
- 15ml soy sauce
- 4 white potatoes
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 1 cauliflower
- 25g honey
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 pepper

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with the five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and lots of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Add the cornflour with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a large bowl and stir in 60ml <span class="text-purple">[80ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>cold water until you are left with a smooth batter

Cut your cauliflower into small florets, then add the cauliflower florets to the batter and stir until they are evenly coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!


### Step 3

Once very hot, add the coated cauliflower to the pan[s] and cook for 10-12 min or until golden and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside – this is your crispy cauliflower

Transfer the crispy cauliflower to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan for later


### Step 4

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small cubes

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 5

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the chopped pepper, chopped ginger and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your honey, red chilli relish and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce


### Step 6

Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

Once thickened, add the crispy cauliflower to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the cauliflower is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky cauliflower


### Step 7

Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips

### Step 8

Serve the sticky cauliflower with the salt & pepper chips to the side

Enjoy!
