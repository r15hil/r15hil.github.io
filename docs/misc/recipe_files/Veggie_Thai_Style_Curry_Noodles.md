## Ingredients

- 80g fine green beans
- 25g roasted peanuts
- 1 medium egg noodles
- 0 Thai red curry paste
- 40g red Thai curry paste
- 15ml soy sauce
- 50g solid creamed coconut
- 1 carrot
- 0 solid creamed coconut
- 1 garlic clove
- 0 soy sauce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into thin batons

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved green beans and carrot batons to the pan and cook for 7-8 min or until the vegetables are slightly softened


### Step 3

Once slightly softened, add your red Thai curry paste and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 4

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and soy sauce in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [900ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs until a sandy paste has formed


### Step 6

Once a sandy paste has formed, add the coconut stock and medium egg noodles to the pan with a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt, then stir frequently until the noodles have loosened

Once loosened, cook for 5-6 min or until the noodles are cooked with a slight bite and the sauce has thickened – these are your veggie Thai-style curry noodles


### Step 7

While the noodles are cooking, chop your roasted peanuts roughly

### Step 8

Serve the veggie Thai-style curry noodles

Sprinkle over the chopped peanuts

Enjoy!
