### Step 5

Drizzle the remaining honey mustard marinade over the chicken

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 3 min, or until the greens are wilted – this is your one tray honey mustard chicken bake

Tip: Keep an eye on the spring greens, as they can burn quickly!

Drizzle everything with any remaining honey mustard marinade from the tin foil

Enjoy!
