## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus, then chop into thirds

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel 2 thin strips per person of zest from your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(avoid the white bitter pith)


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped asparagus to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked ravioli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Add the sliced garlic and lemon zest strips to the pan with the asparagus and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the juice of half your lemon[s] to the pan along with your vegetable stock mix


### Step 6

Reduce the heat to medium-low, then add your crème fraîche, half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a splash of the starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and gently cook for 1 min or until just warmed through

Tip: Make sure the pan isn't too hot as this could cause your sauce to split!


### Step 7

Once the sauce is warmed through, discard the lemon zest, then remove the pan from the heat and add the drained ravioli

Give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy lemon & asparagus sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the creamy lemon & asparagus sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli, with the salad and a lemon wedge to the side

Top the pasta with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and tear over your basil

Garnish with a generous grind of black pepper and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!
