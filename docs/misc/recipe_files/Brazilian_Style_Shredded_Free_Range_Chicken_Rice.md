### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Transfer the browned chicken to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray and reserve the pan

Boil a full kettle

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice, chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further, stirring to coat the grains

Add the beef stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked with a slight bite – this is your spiced rice

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, add the shredded chicken, spinach, roasted onion wedges and cherry tomatoes to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add a knob of butter and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Brazilian-style shredded free range chicken rice

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style shredded free range chicken rice topped with your crispy onions

Enjoy!
