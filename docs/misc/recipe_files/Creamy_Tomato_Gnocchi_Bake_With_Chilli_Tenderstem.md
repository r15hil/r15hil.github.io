## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Peel and dice your red onion[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half


### Step 2

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and give it a good mix up – this is your creamy stock

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a very small drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray, then set aside


### Step 5

Once the onion and garlic has softened, add your halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with your tomato paste

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the tomatoes have begun to soften


### Step 6

Add the creamy stock to the pan with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your creamy tomato sauce

Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your gnocchi (this will cook in the oven later!)

Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish and top with the torn mozzarella


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your creamy tomato gnocchi bake

Put the tray with the Tenderstem broccoli parcel[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once the Tenderstem broccoli is done, mix through your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your chilli Tenderstem

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the chilli!</span>

### Step 8

Serve the creamy tomato gnocchi bake with the chilli Tenderstem to the side

Tip: For a bit of extra indulgence, add a knob of butter to the Tenderstem!

Enjoy!
