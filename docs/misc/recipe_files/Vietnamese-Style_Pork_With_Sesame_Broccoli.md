### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required) to the pan and cook for an initial 2-3 min

Meanwhile, peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

### Step 3

Add the onion petals to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the pork is starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

### Step 4

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Tenderstem broccoli with a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until tender

### Step 5

Once the pork mince is starting to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Tip: Be careful – the garlic and ginger will sizzle from the heat of the oil

Once fragrant, add your red chilli relish, soy sauce, cornflour and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Vietnamese-style pork

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1702394800202-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

### Step 7

Once the broccoli is cooked, add your toasted sesame oil to the pan with a generous pinch of pepper and cook for a final 30 secs – this is your sesame broccoli

### Step 8

Top the cooked rice with the Vietnamese-style pork

Serve the sesame broccoli to the side and season with plenty of pepper

Enjoy!
