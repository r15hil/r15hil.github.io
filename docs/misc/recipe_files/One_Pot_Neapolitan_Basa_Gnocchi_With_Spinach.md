## Ingredients

- 350g gnocchi
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 210g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 80g baby leaf spinach
- 30g pitted black olives
- 15g capers
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half kettle

Heat a large, wide-based oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Crush the garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Add the capers, black olives, gnocchi and crushed garlic to the dish and give everything a good stir


### Step 4

Chop the basa into large, bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Add the chopped tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, vegetable stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water to the dish with a pinch of sugar


### Step 6

Add the chopped basa to the dish and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until the fish is cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the gnocchi has been cooking for 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and give everything a stir

Wash the spinach, then add it to the dish

Cover with the lid and return the dish to the oven for 5 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the fish is cooked through – this is your Neapolitan basa gnocchi

### Step 8

To serve, give everything a good stir and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Drizzle with some olive oil

Let everyone dig in!
