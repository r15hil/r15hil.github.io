## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs, then trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then slice into rounds

Add the potato discs and aubergine rounds to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and diced shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until the shallot has softened and the lamb has browned, then stir in 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min further

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [120ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Add the chopped garlic and your ground cinnamon and cook for 1 min further

Once browned, add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock, bay leaf[ves], dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook over a high heat for 4-5 min or until reduced and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lamb ragù


### Step 5

While the ragù thickens, grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add a pot to a medium heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[500ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time and cook for 4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add your grated cheese and a pinch of salt – this is your cheese sauce


### Step 7

Add the potato discs to an oven-proof dish in a single layer

Spoon over half of the lamb ragù

Then add the aubergine rounds in a single layer, followed by a final layer of lamb ragù

Top with the cheese sauce and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your melty Greek-style lamb moussaka

### Step 8

Once bubbling and golden, leave the melty Greek-style lamb moussaka to cool for 3 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!
