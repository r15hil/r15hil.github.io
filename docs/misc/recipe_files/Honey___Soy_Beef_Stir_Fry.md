## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into large chunks


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your beef mince and onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 4

Once starting to brown, add the sliced carrot, ginger & garlic paste and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

While the beef and veg are cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and honey to the pan with the beef stock and a pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 8-9 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Once the beef is cooked, stir through the chopped spring onion and cook for a further 1 min – this is your honey & soy beef stir-fry

### Step 8

Serve the honey & soy beef stir-fry over the brown rice

Enjoy!
