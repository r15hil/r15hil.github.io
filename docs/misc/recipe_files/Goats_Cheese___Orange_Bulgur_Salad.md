## Ingredients

- 25g blanched almonds
- 0 bulgur wheat
- 75g soft goats' cheese
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 15ml white wine vinegar 
- 10g parsley & chives
- 25g honey 
- 80g spinach
- 1 orange
- 25g pecan nuts
- 30g dried cranberries
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat and dried cranberries to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the onion wedges to a tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min


### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your blanched almonds, pecan nuts, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, half your honey (save the rest for later!), 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt to a bowl, then give everything a good mix until coated

Once coated, add the nuts to the tray[s] with the onion wedges and return to the oven for 8-10 min or until the nuts are toasted and caramelised – these are your spiced nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, zest your orange[s]

Combine the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>orange[s] with your white wine vinegar, remaining honey, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your orange & honey dressing

Peel and slice the remaining orange finely and chop each slice into quarters


### Step 5

Chop your parsley and chives finely together, including the stalks


### Step 6

Once the spiced nuts are toasted, chop them roughly (careful they may be hot!)

Combine half the chopped spiced nuts (save some for garnish!) with the orange zest on a small plate – this is your spiced nut mix

Add your goats' cheese rounds to the plate and roll, pressing the nuts into the cheese, until fully coated – this is your rolled goats' cheese


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach, orange quarters, roasted onion wedges, orange & honey dressing and most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish!) to the cooked bulgur

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your orange bulgur salad

### Step 8

Serve the orange bulgur salad and crumble the rolled goats' cheese over the top

Garnish with the remaining chopped herbs and reserved spiced nuts

Enjoy!
