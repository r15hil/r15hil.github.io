Drain and rinse your black beans

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper, halved cherry tomatoes and drained black beans

Give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your spice mix

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 mins or until the sweet potato has softened
