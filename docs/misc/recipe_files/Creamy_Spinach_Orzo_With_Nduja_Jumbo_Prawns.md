## Instructions


### Step 1

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil a kettle


### Step 2

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut the lemon[s] into 4 wedges per lemon


### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 450ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> [900ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your soft cheese – this is your creamy stock


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and lemon zest and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once the garlic is fragrant, add your orzo to the pan with the juice of 1/4 of the lemon wedges

Add the creamy stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your creamy orzo

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking!


### Step 6

While the orzo is cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, drain, then add your jumbo prawns and the spinach and cook for 4-5 min

Tear in your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of 1/4 of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon wedges and cook for 2-3 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and the ’Nduja has broken down – these are your 'Nduja jumbo prawns


### Step 7

Once the orzo is cooked through, season generously with black pepper and a pinch of salt

Add the juice of the remaining lemon wedges to a bowl with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a grind of black pepper – this is your lemony dressing

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the creamy orzo with the 'Nduja jumbo prawns over the top – this is your creamy spinach orzo with 'Nduja jumbo prawns

Spoon any remaining 'Nduja oil from the pan over the orzo

Serve the baby leaf salad to the side drizzled with the lemony dressing

Enjoy!
