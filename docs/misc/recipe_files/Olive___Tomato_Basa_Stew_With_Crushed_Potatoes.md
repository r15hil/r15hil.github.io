## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) 3/4 of your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Once hot, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add your dried thyme and ground smoked paprika to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock mix with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water


### Step 5

Chop your basa fillet[s] in half

Add the chopped basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop your black olives in half

Chop the remaining garlic finely

Grind the chopped garlic and half the chopped olives (you'll use the rest later!) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your olive tapenade

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!


### Step 7

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the fish is cooked through, add the spinach and the remaining chopped olives to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your olive & tomato basa stew

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add a knob of butter with a pinch of salt and pepper and roughly crush with a fork – these are your crushed potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the olive & tomato basa stew with the crushed potatoes to the side

Drizzle the olive tapenade over everything

Enjoy!
