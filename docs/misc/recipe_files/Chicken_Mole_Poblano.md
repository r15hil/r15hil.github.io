### Step 2

Add the white long grain rice, a pinch of salt and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 3

Whilst the rice is cooking, add the ground cumin and dried oregano to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chicken thighs and give them a good mix up until they're fully coated in the spices

Add the dried ancho chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and sultanas to a bowl, cover them in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and set aside for 5 min to soften

### Step 5

Whilst the chicken is cooking, chop the half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the dark chocolate roughly

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining dark chocolate fo another recipe!

Dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with the tomato paste, chopped chocolate, peanut butter and white wine vinegar – this is your mole stock

### Step 6

Carefully remove the dried ancho chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>from the bowl and chop roughly (reserving half the soaking liquid!)

Add the chopped ancho chilli and sultanas to a food processor and blitz until smooth

Slowly pour in the reserved soaking liquid whilst blitzing – this is your ancho chilli sauce

### Step 7

Add the mole stock and ancho chilli sauce to the chicken and cook for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken mole poblano

### Step 8

Give the rice & peas a good mix up

Serve the chicken mole poblano with the rice & peas to the side and garnish with the pickled red onion

Enjoy!
