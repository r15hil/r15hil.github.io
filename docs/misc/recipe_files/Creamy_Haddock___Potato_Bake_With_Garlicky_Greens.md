### Step 2

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is starting to soften

### Step 4

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml] </span>boiled water

Stir in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock

### Step 5

Add approx. 2/3 of the creamy stock (save the rest for later!) to the pan with the haddock and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Once the sauce has thickened, add the browned potatoes (reserve the pan) and a grind of black pepper to the pan with the fish and mix everything together – this is your creamy haddock mixture

### Step 6

Transfer the creamy haddock mixture to an oven-proof dish and pour over the remaining creamy stock, then top with the grated cheese

Season with a grind of black pepper and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and the cheese is melted and golden – this is your creamy haddock & potato bake

### Step 7

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until softened, then add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your garlicky greens

### Step 8

Serve the creamy haddock & potato bake with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!
