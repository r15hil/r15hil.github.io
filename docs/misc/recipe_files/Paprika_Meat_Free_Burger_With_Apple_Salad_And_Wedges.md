### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray, drizzle them with vegetable oil, then season with half of the smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25 min until they're crisp – these are your paprika wedges

### Step 2

While the wedges are cooking, trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Combine the meat-free burger patties with the remaining smoked paprika and half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl and season generously with pepper

Divide and shape the meat-free burger mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> patties and refrigerate until step 6 – these are your paprika meat-free patties

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted

Once toasted, set aside until serving and reserve the pan

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 4

Peel the red onions, then slice into thin rings

Return the reserved pan, with a drizzle of olive oil, to a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onions have started to caramelise

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings

### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine the red wine vinegar, mayo, remaining sliced spring onion, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your salad dressing

Thinly slice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(skin on), then add to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the paprika meat-free patties and cook, covered, for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

### Step 7

Wash and shred the lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and mix it all together – this is your apple salad

### Step 8

To assemble, sandwich the paprika meat-free patties, caramelised onion rings and some apple salad between your toasted brioche halves – these are your paprika meat-free burgers

Serve the paprika wedges and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!
