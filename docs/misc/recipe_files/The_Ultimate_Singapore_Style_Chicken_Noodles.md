Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into matchsticks

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Add your fine egg noodles to a bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

### Step 5

Once the chicken has started to brown, add your sliced onion, carrot matchsticks and pepper strips to the pan and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the vegetables are beginning to soften

### Step 6

Once softened, add your curry powder, ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Once fragrant, push the chicken and vegetables to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg

Add the drained noodles with your soy sauce, a splash of reserved starchy noodle water and a knob of butter and give everything a good mix up or until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – this is your Singapore-style chicken noodles

### Step 8

Serve the Singapore-style chicken noodles topped with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
