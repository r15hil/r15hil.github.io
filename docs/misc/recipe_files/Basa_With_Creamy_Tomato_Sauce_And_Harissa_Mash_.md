### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes and the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

### Step 6

Once the tomatoes are tender, add the basa and spinach, and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the basa is cooked through and the spinach has wilted – this is your creamy tomato sauce

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Do this in batches!

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

While the basa is cooking, return the drained potato & carrot to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk, your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your harissa mash

Tip: Don't worry if your carrot doesn't get completely smooth, it will add some texture to your mash!

### Step 8

Serve the cooked basa over the harissa mash

Drizzle over the creamy tomato sauce

Enjoy!
