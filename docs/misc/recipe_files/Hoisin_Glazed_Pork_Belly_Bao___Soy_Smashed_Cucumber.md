### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side

Cut 2 pieces of tin foil approx. the size of A4 paper per pork belly

Lay the browned pork belly (skin-side up), in the middle of the 2 pieces of foil, (doubling it up prevents any leakages!) and reserve the pan

### Step 3

Loosely scrunch the edges of the foil around the pork<span class="text-danger"> </span>leaving the skin exposed and transfer the parcel[s] to a baking tray

Pour 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water around the pork

Put the tray in the oven for 40-45 min or until the pork skin is crisp and the meat is cooked through and tender – this is your roasted pork belly

### Step 4

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim and chop your spring onion[s] in thirds, then cut lengthways into thin strips

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

### Step 5

Combine half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, then add the grated carrot and spring onion strips – this is your quick-pickled carrot

Combine half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of sugar, then add the smashed cucumber – this is your soy smashed cucumber

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a splash of cold water – this is your sriracha mayo

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1687338639609-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Once the pork belly has had 30 min, add the tray[s] with the chips to the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1687338643421-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once the pork is nearly ready, return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add your hoisin sauce, the remaining soy sauce, the remaining rice vinegar and your star anise

Bring to the boil and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened, once the pork is ready, transfer it to a clean chopping board and slice into 3 slices per person, then add it to the pan – this is your hoisin glazed pork

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

### Step 8

To build, fill each warmed bao bun with the quick-pickled carrot and top with a slice of the hoisin glazed pork

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo

Serve the soy smashed cucumber and chips to the side with the remaining sriracha mayo

Enjoy!
