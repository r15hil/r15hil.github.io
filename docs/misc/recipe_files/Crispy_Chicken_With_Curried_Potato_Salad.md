### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat oven to to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, then pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

### Step 2

Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

### Step 3

Once the chicken skin has crisped, turn the chicken thighs over and cook for 1 min further

Transfer the crispy chicken to a baking tray (skin side up) and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Reserve the pan and any remaining juices

### Step 5

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them and set them aside in a colander

Trim, then add your green beans to the potato pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Add your blanched peas and cook for 1 min further, then drain and set aside until serving

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with your curry powder and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and add the drained potatoes with your white wine vinegar, mayo, sliced shallot and most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish!)
