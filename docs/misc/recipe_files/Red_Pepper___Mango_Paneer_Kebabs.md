## Description

Paneer is a mild Indian cheese, similar in texture to halloumi, but without the saltiness. It has an extremely high melting point, which means you can grill and heat it without it melting, making it perfect for kebabs and barbecues! We've served these with a mango chutney dressing, toasted rice and salad.
