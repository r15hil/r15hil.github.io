Once fragrant, add the orzo to the pot with the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Pat the pork loin steaks dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add the steaks with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the cooked steaks to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 2 min
