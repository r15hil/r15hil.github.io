## Description

Ramen is a Japanese wheat noodle broth that’s usually made with pork or fish stock, which requires simmering for hours. Making a flavourful vegetarian ramen in around half an hour seemed like an impossible task when we first tackled this recipe, but we got there in the end. Like true Japanese cooking it’s healthy, balanced, subtle and nourishing.
