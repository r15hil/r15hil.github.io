## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gem lettuce
- Raw peeled king prawns (85g) x0
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Baharat (1tsp)
- Raw peeled king prawns (171g)
- Ground sumac (1tsp)
- Harissa paste (20g)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Spring onion x3
- Skewers x4

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden


### Step 2

Meanwhile, take 25g<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[37g]</span> [50g]</span> butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Trim, then cut your spring onions into quarters

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then chop roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the lettuce into quarters, lengthways, then chop roughly


### Step 3

Combine your mayo and white wine vinegar in a bowl with your ground sumac, chopped cucumber, chopped lettuce and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your chunky sumac salad

Add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and softened butter to a bowl and mix it all together – this is your harissa butter

Tip: If your butter is not softened then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!


### Step 4

Drain, then pat your king prawns dry with kitchen paper

Add the king prawns and the chopped spring onion to a bowl with your baharat and a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your marinated king prawns & spring onion


### Step 5

Thread the marinated king prawns & spring onion evenly onto the skewers – these are your loaded skewers


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are almost cooked, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the loaded skewers to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the prawns are nicely charred and cooked through – these are your baharat king prawn skewers


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the harissa butter to the cooked potatoes and give everything a good mix up until the potatoes are fully coated – these are your buttery harissa potatoes

### Step 8

Serve the baharat king prawn skewers with the buttery harissa potatoes and chunky sumac salad to the side

Enjoy!
