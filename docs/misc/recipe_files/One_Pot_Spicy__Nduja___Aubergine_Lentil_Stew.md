### Step 1

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into small bite-sized cubes

Heat a pot (with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the chopped aubergine and cook for 5-6 min or until lightly browned

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

### Step 3

Once the aubergine is lightly browned, reduce the heat to medium and tear your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the pot

Add the grated garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your dried thyme with your tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, rinsed red lentils and chicken stock mix

### Step 6

Once the 'Nduja aubergine & lentil stew is ready, stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a small pinch of salt

Set aside, with the lid on, for 2-3 min for the flavours to develop – this is your one pot spicy 'Nduja & aubergine lentil stew

### Step 7

Place the halved ciabatta in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once the ciabatta is toasted, rub the sliced-side of the reserved garlic over it (not a fan of raw garlic? Only use a little!)

Spread a knob of butter over the toasted ciabatta – this is your garlicky toast

### Step 8

Tear your basil over the one pot spicy 'Nduja & aubergine lentil stew and top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Serve with the garlicky toast to the side

Enjoy!
