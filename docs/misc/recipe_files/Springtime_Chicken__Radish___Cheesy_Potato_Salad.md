- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Mini cosberg lettuce
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Score the cut side in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way through


### Step 2

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper and add the grated Italian hard cheese to the centre, being careful not to spread the mixture out too thin

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Italian cheese base


### Step 3

Add the halved potatoes to the Italian cheese base, cut side down

Drizzle over a little olive oil with a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the potatoes and cheese are golden and crispy


### Step 4

Top, tail and chop your radishes into quarters

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your wholegrain mustard, honey and white wine vinegar in a large bowl

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>olive oil with a pinch of salt and mix everything together – this is your honey mustard dressing


### Step 7

Toss the radish quarters and shredded lettuce through the dressing – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the dressed salad topped with the cheesy potatoes and chicken breast strips – this is your springtime chicken, radish & cheesy potato salad

Drizzle over any remaining honey mustard dressing and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!
