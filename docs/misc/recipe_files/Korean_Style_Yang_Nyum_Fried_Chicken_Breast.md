### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

### Step 3

While the rice is cooking, combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar, tomato ketchup, honey and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your yang-nyum sauce

### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine 1/2 tsp per person of the yang-nyum sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with your mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a separate bowl – this is your creamy Korean-style dressing

### Step 5

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to a bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> flour and your soy sauce

Give everything a good mix up so the chicken is fully coated

Add your cornflour to a separate bowl

Add the chopped chicken breast to the bowl with the cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken breast and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken breast

Once crispy, transfer to kitchen paper and reserve the pan

### Step 7

Once the chicken is done, carefully pour away the oil

Tip: Store it in a glass jar and you can use this oil again for frying!

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add the chopped garlic and remaining yang-nyum sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the crispy chicken breast with your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your Korean-style yang-nyum fried chicken breast

### Step 8

Combine the grated carrot and shredded lettuce – this is your salad

Serve the Korean-style yang-nyum fried chicken breast with the cooked rice and salad to the side, then garnish the chicken with the sliced spring onion and drizzle the creamy Korean-style dressing over the salad

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl

Enjoy!
