## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 60g panko breadcrumbs
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 390g cannellini beans
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 3 white potatoes
- 280g plain tofu
- 1 spring onion
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

Whilst the wedges are cooking, drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the tofu into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> strips

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


### Step 3

Grate the cheddar cheese

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the smoked paprika, dried oregano and half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix together (this will make your breadcrumbs golden!)


### Step 4

Season the tofu strips generously with salt, then coat them in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

Add the breaded tofu strips to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through and golden – these are your homemade tofu goujons


### Step 5

Whilst the tofu goujons are cooking, boil half a kettle

Heat a medium pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Once the onion has softened, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with the chopped tomatoes, Henderson’s Relish, vegetable stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – these are your beans


### Step 7

Whilst the beans are thickening, trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 8

Serve the homemade tofu goujons with the beans and potato wedges to the side

Top the beans with the remaining grated cheese and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
