## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans


### Step 3

Once the pan is hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes and drained cannellini beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 5

Add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix, dried basil and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up


### Step 6

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the kale and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until wilted


### Step 7

Once the kale has wilted, add the drained tortelloni and a knob of butter and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is nicely coated in the sauce – this is your white bean & tomato sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

### Step 8

Serve the white bean & tomato sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
