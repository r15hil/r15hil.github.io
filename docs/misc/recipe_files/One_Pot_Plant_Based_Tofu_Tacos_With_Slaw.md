## Ingredients

- 32g tomato paste
- 160g carrot & cabbage slaw mix
- 30ml vegan mayonnaise
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 6 plain tortillas
- 20g chipotle paste
- 8g Marmite
- 280g plain tofu
- 5g coriander
- 3 garlic cloves

- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife, remove the skins and discard

Peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add onion wedges and crushed garlic to the dish and cook for 2-3 min or until the vegetables are starting to soften


### Step 4

Meanwhile, roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine the cabbage & carrot slaw mix with the vegan mayo and the juice of the lime in a large bowl with a generous grind of pepper – this is your zingy lime slaw

Once the vegetables have softened, crumble the drained tofu roughly into the dish with your hands and cook for a further 1 min


### Step 5

Add the Marmite, smoked paprika, chilli flakes, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the dish

Add 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your plant-based tofu taco mix


### Step 6

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the tofu is nearly cooked, add the tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the plant-based tofu taco mix in the warmed tortillas and top with the zingy lime slaw

Chop the coriander roughly over the tacos with scissors

Enjoy!
