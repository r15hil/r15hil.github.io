## Ingredients

- 16g tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 2 tomatoes
- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 2 hake fillets
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 150g orzo
- 15ml white wine vinegar
- 80g spinach
- 3 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Chop the tomatoes roughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to break down


### Step 2

While the tomatoes are softening, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 450ml <span class="text-danger">[900ml] </span>boiled water and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> milk – this is your stock

Wash the spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add the stock to a medium-sized pot (with a matching lid) with the orzo and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking


### Step 4

Once the tomatoes have softened, add the sliced garlic and dried thyme with a generous crack of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the tomato paste with a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix everything together, then add the white wine vinegar with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened


### Step 5

Meanwhile, peel 1/3 of the Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese finely


### Step 6

Once slightly thickened, add the hake fillets to the pan and top with the spinach

Cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the fish is cooked through and the spinach has wilted – this is your tangy tomato hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Once the orzo is ready, stir through the grated Italian cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your cheesy orzo

Tip: Add a splash more water if your orzo is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy orzo in bowls topped with the tangy tomato hake

Sprinkle over the cheese shavings and drizzle over a little olive oil

Enjoy!
