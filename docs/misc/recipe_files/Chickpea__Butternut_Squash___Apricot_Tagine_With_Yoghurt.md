Peel and finely chop your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until caramelised

### Step 3

Dissolve your tomato paste, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[650ml]</span> boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped garlic, baharat, diced butternut squash and chopped cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften

### Step 4

Reboil a kettle

Once the tomatoes are soft, add the harissa stock, drained chickpeas and diced apricots and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the sauce has thickened and the butternut squash is tender – this is your chickpea, butternut squash & apricot tagine

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry!

### Step 5

Dissolve the remaining vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with the vegetable stock, cover and set aside

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 7

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the couscous is done, add the chopped coriander and the chopped mint with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt, then fluff with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the chickpea, butternut squash & apricot tagine with the couscous to the side

Garnish with your toasted almonds and a dollop of natural yoghurt

Enjoy!
