### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin, then add it to a pot with the white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice the aubergines in half and then into strips

Peel and slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into wedges

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 3

Add the sliced aubergine strips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Make sure the aubergine strips have some space so they don't steam!

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the aubergine is golden and soft

### Step 4

Whilst the aubergine is cooking, combine the soy sauce, cornflour, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar, 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>cold water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> brown sugar – this is your chilli sauce

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

When the onion has softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the roasted aubergine and give everything a good stir

### Step 7

Give the chilli sauce another good mix up and add it to the pan and cook for 1 min or until thick and sticky – this is your chilli & ginger aubergine stir-fry

### Step 8

Discard the lemongrass from the cooked rice and fluff the grains with a fork

Serve the chilli & ginger aubergine stir-fry over the lemongrass rice and garnish with the sliced spring onion, chopped coriander leaves, roasted peanuts and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!
