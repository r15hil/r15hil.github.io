### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters

### Step 2

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then into small, bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and grate (or very finely chop) your garlic

### Step 3

Add the chopped pepper, onion quarters, chopped courgette and chopped carrot to a large baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the veg is tender and starting to colour – this is your chunky roast veg

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh and chopped garlic to the pan with half of your ras el hanout (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 5

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Chop your dried cranberries finely

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water with your ground turmeric and remaining ras el hanout – this is your spiced stock

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1679326523518-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the chopped cranberries and your couscous to a bowl with the spiced stock and give everything a good mix up

Cover the bowl, then set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 8

Fluff the spiced couscous with a fork, then add your cider vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your jewelled couscous

Add the chunky roast veg, spiced chicken thigh and half the toasted flaked almonds to the jewelled couscous and give everything a good mix – this is your chicken thigh & roasted veg with jewelled couscous

Serve the chicken thigh & roasted veg with jewelled couscous topped with the remaining toasted flaked almonds and enjoy!
