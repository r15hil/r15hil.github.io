### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the dish and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly browned

### Step 3

Whilst the mince is browning, deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into chunks

Crush the garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

### Step 4

Add the crushed garlic and chopped pepper to the dish with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add the soy sauce, mirin, chicken stock mix and 3/4 of the gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), then stir it all together and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put it in the oven for 20 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your oven-baked Korean-style pork

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the sushi rice to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sticky rice

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1653318934200-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

While the rice is cooking, cut the cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Add the chopped cucumber to a bowl with the rice vinegar, mayo and the remaining gochujang paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your gochujang cucumber

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1653318939565-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once cooked, remove the oven-baked Korean-style pork from the oven and leave it to cool (lid on) for 4-5 min (this helps the flavours to develop), then give everything a good mix up

### Step 8

Set the oven-baked Korean-style pork in the centre of the table, ready to share

Serve the sticky rice and gochujang cucumber to the side

Garnish the sticky rice with the black sesame seeds and drizzle any remaining gochujang sauce over the cucumber

Let everyone dig in!
