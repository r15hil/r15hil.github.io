### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork and any juices to an oven-proof dish

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min

### Step 2

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the macaroni and set aside until later, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> starchy pasta water

Add your sweetcorn cobette[s] to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until charred and crispy

### Step 3

While the macaroni is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the grated cheese with your cornflour in a bowl and mix until the cheese is fully coated

### Step 4

Add the coated cheese to a pot with the chopped garlic, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and reserved starchy pasta water and bring to a boil over a medium heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 2-3 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and thickened – this is your cheese sauce

### Step 5

After 20 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Transfer the BBQ pulled pork and any cooking juices to a bowl, reserving the dish, and pull apart using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add your BBQ sauce to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your shredded BBQ pulled pork

### Step 6

Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce with a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to the reserved dish and top with the shredded BBQ pulled pork

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your BBQ pulled pork mac 'n' cheese

### Step 7

While the mac 'n' cheese is in the oven, wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the sliced shallot, white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard in a large bowl with a pinch of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your mustard dressing

Add the salad to the mustard dressing and toss – this is your mustard salad

### Step 8

Serve the BBQ pulled pork mac 'n' cheese with the charred corn and mustard salad to the side

Sprinkle your crispy onions over the mac 'n' cheese

Enjoy!
