## Description

Did someone say empanadas? Instead of making your own dough, you'll seal tortilla wraps with a clever hack that'll save you bags of time. Stuff them with fragrant pepper, black bean and sweetcorn filling, then top with cheese to bake.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp – these are your paprika chips

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the shallots<span class="text-danger"> </span>and garlic

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Dice the tomatoes<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Drain and rinse the black beans

Drain and rinse the sweetcorn

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half the diced shallot, half the chopped pepper and half the diced tomato (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and the remaining smoked paprika and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and half the drained sweetcorn (save the rest for later!) with a generous pinch of salt

Add a few splashes of water and cook for 4-5 min or until softened – this is your smoky bean & corn mix

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese finely

Combine 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp]</span> flour with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl to form a thick paste – this is your flour paste

### Step 5

Divide the smoky bean & corn mix and grated cheese between the tortilla wraps, covering only half and leaving a little space around the edges

Rub some of the flour paste along the edge of the tortillas, fold over and press down firmly to seal so you're left with 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> half moon-shaped tortillas

Tip: Use a little more flour paste if it's not sealing!

### Step 6

Add the folded tortillas to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and lightly brush them with olive oil

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky bean & corn empanadas

Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 7

Combine the remaining chopped pepper, chopped tomato and drained sweetcorn in a large bowl with the chopped mint, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your corn salad

In a separate small bowl, combine the chopped parsley and red wine vinegar with the remaining shallot and the natural yoghurt

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper – this is your herby yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the smoky bean & corn empanadas with the corn salad, paprika chips and herby yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!
