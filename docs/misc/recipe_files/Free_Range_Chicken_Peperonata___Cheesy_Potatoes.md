## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop finely, discarding the stems

Cut your waxy potatoes into bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Add the chopped waxy potatoes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the chopped rosemary and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are starting to crisp


### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Add the pepper strips and cook for 5-7 min or until softened

Once softened, add the sliced red onion and cook for 5-6 min further

Boil a kettle


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your free range chicken breast portion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Add your dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water

Add your balsamic vinegar and tomato paste to the peppers and cook for 1 min further

Add the chicken stock with a pinch of sugar and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 7

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Remove the tray with the rosemary potatoes from the oven and add the grated cheese and chopped garlic

Put the tray back in the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted –these are your cheesy potatoes

### Step 8

Once done, shred the chicken apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Stir the shredded chicken through the peppers – this is your free range chicken peperonata

Serve the free range chicken peperonata with the cheesy potatoes to the side

Enjoy!
