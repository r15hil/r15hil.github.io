### Step 1

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat the halloumi dry then score in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut all the way

Sprinkle the smoked paprika and ground coriander all over with a drizzle of vegetable oil – this is your spiced halloumi

Once hot, add the spiced halloumi, scored-side down and cook for 5 min or until slightly charred

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel the potatoes and cut into quarters

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly and top, tail and slice finely, then peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped potatoes to one side of a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper

### Step 3

Add the sliced leek to the middle of a large piece of tin foil with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a small knob of butter and mix everything together

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the leek to form a sealed parcel and add to the baking tray

Once the halloumi is slightly charred, transfer it to the baking tray, reserving the pan and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp

### Step 4

Fill 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> holes of a muffin tray with a very small drizzle of vegetable oil (about 1 tsp per hole) and put it in the oven for 8 min to heat up

Tip: No muffin tray? Fill a small oven-proof dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to make one giant Yorkshire!

Meanwhile, combine the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with 35g <span class="text-danger">[70g]</span> flour and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk in a jug, then whisk in the dried oregano and remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of pepper – this is your batter

### Step 5

After 8 min, remove the muffin tray from the oven and evenly drizzle the batter into the hot oil

Return the tray to the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your ranch Yorkshires

### Step 6

Boil half a kettle

Chop the chives finely

Combine 150ml <span class="text-danger">[275ml]</span> boiled water with the sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and Henderson's Relish – this is your buffalo stock

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1663095539075-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Return the reserved pan to a low heat with a generous knob of butter

Once melted, add the cornflour and cook for 30 secs

Add the buffalo stock and cook for a further 2-3 min or until it thickens to a gravy-like consistency – this is your buffalo gravy

### Step 8

Transfer the cooked halloumi to a chopping board and slice thickly – this is your roast halloumi

Serve the roast halloumi with the roast potatoes and ranch Yorkshires

Sprinkle the chives over the leeks and serve to the side

Drizzle the buffalo gravy all over

Enjoy!
