### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste with your curry powder and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

### Step 3

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your green lentils

Pat your cod fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt

### Step 4

Add the drained lentils to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until everything is combined

Chop<span class="text-danger"> </span>your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

### Step 5

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the coconut stock to the pan along with your spinach and cook for 3-4 min or until all the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened – these are your curried lentils

### Step 6

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your ground turmeric and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cod fillet[s] to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your turmeric cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 7

While the cod is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with your nigella seeds, your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled carrot

### Step 8

Serve the curried lentils with the turmeric cod over the top

Top with the quick-pickled carrot

Enjoy!
