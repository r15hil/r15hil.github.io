## Ingredients

- Tomato paste (16g)
- Tomato
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Vegan mayonnaise (30ml)
- Ground sumac (1tsp)
- Meat-free chick'n (160g)
- Harissa paste (20g) x0
- Carrot
- Harissa paste (40g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Mint & dill (10g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges and cut the cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems, then chop your dill finely, including the stalks


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Chop your pitta[s] into rough bite-sized triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span>[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and your ground sumac

Give it a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden


### Step 4

Whilst the meat-free chick'n is browning, dissolve your tomato paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the meat-free chick'n has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the harissa stock

Cook for a further 3-4 min, until the meat-free chick'n is warmed through and the stock has reduced


### Step 5

Whilst everything is cooking, combine your vegan mayo with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up until it's smooth – this is your lemony dressing


### Step 6

Once the meat-free chick'n is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the meat-free chick'n to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the sauce


### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then add to a large bowl with the grated carrot, chopped cucumber, tomato wedges, crunchy pitta and most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish!)

Add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice from the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt

Give it a gentle mix up – this is your crunchy pitta salad

### Step 8

Serve the shredded harissa meat-free chick'n over the crunchy pitta salad

Drizzle with the lemony dressing and garnish with the remaining herbs

Enjoy!
