## Ingredients

- 11g chicken stock mix
- 160g Tenderstem broccoli
- 80ml double cream
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 3 white potatoes
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 320g British skinless chicken thighs
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Add the potatoes to a baking tray and prick them a few times with a sharp knife, add a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 45 min or until cooked through


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over high heat

Peel and halve the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins


### Step 4

Once the dish is hot, add the chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the halved shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and peeled garlic with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add 260ml <span class="text-danger">[420ml]</span> boiled water with the Chinese rice wine and chicken stock mix

Add the bay leaves and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 35 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & bay

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel, then set aside until later

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!


### Step 7

After the initial 35 min, add the Tenderstem broccoli parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the tray with the potatoes and cook for 10-12 min or until tender with a bite

Remove the dish from the oven and stir through the double cream, then return the dish to the oven, lid on, and cook for a final 8-10 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your creamy chicken & bay

Once everything is ready, remove the potatoes from the oven and crush them firmly with a spatula, then add a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken & bay over the crushed potatoes with the Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Discard the bay leaves

Let everyone dig in!
