## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Combine your meat-free chick'n with the ground coriander, 1/3 of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>garam masala (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your seasoned meat-free chick'n


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned meat-free chick'n and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and starting to brown

Once done, transfer the browned meat-free chick'n to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter

Once the butter has melted, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened and starting to caramelise


### Step 5

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, ground turmeric, tomato paste and remaining garam masala to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your vegetable stock mix, then add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 6

Return the browned meat-free chick'n to the pan and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season to taste – this is your coriander rice


### Step 7

Once the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your clotted cream – this is your meat-free butter chick'n

### Step 8

Serve the meat-free butter chick'n over the coriander rice

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!
