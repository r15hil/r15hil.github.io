### Step 5

Once the kale has been in the oven for 20 min, make some space on the baking tray (the kale will have shrunk!) and add the smoked&nbsp;mackerel&nbsp;


Sprinkle the kale with the toasted sesame seeds &ndash;&nbsp;this is your kale seaweed&nbsp;


Return the baking tray to the oven for 5 min further

Return the pan to a medium heat, bring to a boil and cook for 30 sec

Tip: don't worry if it goes lumpy &ndash; just keep whisking!

### Step 7

Combine the&nbsp;mayonnaise&nbsp;and rice vinegar&nbsp;with a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl&nbsp;


Add the drained potatoes, carrots and sliced shallot


Give everything a good old mix up, crushing the potatoes&nbsp;as you go &ndash; this is your Japanese potato salad&nbsp;


Drain the radishes

### Step 8

Serve the kale seaweed next to the pickled radishes and Japanese potato salad with the mackerel to the side


Spoon the Teriyaki sauce over the mackerel and garnish with the sliced spring onion&nbsp;


Enjoy!
