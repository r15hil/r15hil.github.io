### Step 3

Add the softened potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 12-15 min or until crispy on the outside

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool and once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

### Step 4

Combine the grated cheese with your cornflour in a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) and mix until the cheese is coated in the flour

Add the remaining wholegrain mustard to the pan with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk and a pinch of salt and pepper

Set aside the cheese sauce for later

### Step 5

Once the potatoes have had an initial 12-15 min, remove the tray from the oven

Slice the potatoes in half down the middle (careful they will be hot!) and open them out like a book

Top each potato with 1 tsp butter and mix it through with a fork

Top with the wilted spinach

### Step 6

Lay your prosciutto around the edge of each potato

Spoon the cheese sauce into the centre and reserve the pan for later

Return the tray to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until cheese sauce is bubbling and golden and the prosciutto is slightly crispy – these are your jacket potatoes

### Step 7

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your eggs into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

### Step 8

Serve the jacket potatoes topped with a fried egg, then season with a small pinch of salt and pepper – this is your prosciutto croque madame jacket potato

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
