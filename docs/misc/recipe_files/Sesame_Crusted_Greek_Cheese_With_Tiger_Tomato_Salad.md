## Ingredients

- Basil (5g)
- Toasted sesame seeds (5g)
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Courgette
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Toger tomatoes (1pkt)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Black sesame seeds (5g)
- Honey (25g)
- Rocket (50g)
- Garlic clove
- Lemon
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Open up your wholemeal pittas (like a book!), then roughly chop into strips

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Top, tail and peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Chop the courgette stem[s] into bite-sized pieces


### Step 3

Add the onion petals, sliced wholemeal pittas and chopped courgette stem to a baking tray with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a very generous drizzle of olive oil and a large pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, then set aside


### Step 4

Cut your Greek cheese into triangles for per person

Add your black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds to a plate and mix them together

Drizzle a little olive oil over the Greek cheese triangles, then transfer them to the mixed sesame seeds and press down on both sides until they're fully coated – this is your sesame-crusted Greek cheese


### Step 5

Add the sesame-crusted Greek cheese to a separate baking paper-lined tray

Put both baking trays with the pitta and cheese in the oven for 15-16 min or until the pitta is crispy and the cheese is slightly golden


### Step 6

Squeeze the juice of half your lemon[s] into a size bowl with a pinch of salt and the remaining garlic (don’t like raw garlic? Go easy!) and stir everything together

Add the courgette ribbons and toss, then set aside – these are your lemony courgette ribbons

Cut your tiger tomatoes into thin wedges and chop your basil finely, including the stalks


### Step 7

Combine the juice from the remaining lemon[s] in a bowl with your honey, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your honey dressing

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Mix the salad through the lemony courgette ribbons until well coated – this is your lemon courgette salad

### Step 8

Serve the lemony courgette salad on plates with the crispy pitta, onion petals and roasted courgette over the top

Add the tiger tomato wedges and top with the sesame-crusted Greek cheese

Sprinkle over the sliced basil and drizzle over the honey dressing

Finish with a grind of black pepper and enjoy!
