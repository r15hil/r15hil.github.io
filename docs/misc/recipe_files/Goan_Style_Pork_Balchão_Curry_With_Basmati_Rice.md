## Description

The word ‘balchão’ in this dish refers to the use of vinegar as a way of preserving fish and meat, and it's what gives this curry its fiery sour flavour. Serve as they would in Goa, over hot basmati rice.

### Step 1

Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your pork loin steak[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, once hot, add the chopped pork and cook for 4 min, turning occasionally until the pork is browned,  then once done, transfer the browned pork to a plate and reserve the pan

### Step 2

While the pork is cooking, peel and dice your red onions (as finely as you can!)

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 5

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, ground coriander, ground cumin, chilli flakes, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind to a smooth paste

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your balchão spice paste

### Step 7

Return the browned pork to the pan and add your tamarind paste, cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the pork is almost cooked through, then add the spinach with 60ml <span class="text-purple">[80ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water

Cook for a final 2-3 min or until the spinach has just wilted, the sauce is thickened to a curry-like consistency and the pork is fully cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Goan-style pork balchão curry

### Step 8

Serve the Goan-style pork balchão curry with the basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!
