## Ingredients

- 80g oyster mushroom mix
- 1 dried ancho chilli
- 1 can of black beans (185g)
- 1 tamari soy sauce sachet (15ml)
- 1 avocado
- 100g basmati rice
- 10g coriander
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cover the dried ancho chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in boiled water and set aside to soak

Tear the portobellos and oyster mushroom mix into small pieces


### Step 2

Add the torn mushrooms to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10-15 min or until the mushrooms have started to brown


### Step 3

Add the basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a pinch of salt and a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Whilst the rice is cooking, carefully remove the ancho chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> from the water and chop as finely as you can

Combine the chopped ancho chilli with the smoked paprika, half the tamari soy sauce (save the rest for later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil – this is your ancho chilli sauce


### Step 5

Once the mushrooms are starting to brown, remove them from the oven

Add the ancho chilli sauce and give everything a good mix up

Return the mushrooms to the oven for 10 min further or until golden and caramelised – these are your pulled ancho mushrooms


### Step 6

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans

Heat a separate pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained black beans and ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the remaining tamari soy sauce with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime, 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [75ml]</span> boiled water and mash until smooth – these are your frijoles


### Step 7

Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways and season with a pinch of salt

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Stir half the chopped coriander through the cooked rice

Serve the pulled ancho mushrooms with the frijoles, coriander rice and sliced avocado to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a wedge of lime

Enjoy!
