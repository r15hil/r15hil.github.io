### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the curry powder to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chicken thighs to the curry powder and turn them several times until they're fully coated in the curry powder – these are your curried chicken thighs

### Step 2

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the curried chicken thighs to the pan and cook for 7-8 min on each side or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Boil a kettle and preheat the grill to high

### Step 4

Cut the heritage beef tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into 4<span class="text-danger"> [8] </span>rounds

Add the heritage beef tomato rounds to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Sprinkle over the ground cumin and half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Season with a pinch of salt and a small drizzle of olive oil – these are your spiced heritage beef tomato rounds

### Step 5

Wash the spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly

### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, stir through the chopped spinach and chicken stock mix – this is your green rice

Combine the mango chutney with the cider vinegar, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your mango dressing

### Step 8

Serve the green rice with the spiced heritage beef tomato rounds to the side

Top with the curried chicken and drizzle the mango dressing all over

Enjoy!
