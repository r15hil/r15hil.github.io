## Ingredients

- 8ml fish sauce
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 130g basmati rice
- 2 x 100g basa fillets
- 50g creamed coconut
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 10g fresh coriander
- 3 dried lime leaves

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop roughly

Add the chopped coconut cream, lime leaves and a generous pinch of salt in a large pan, stir in 500ml<span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat - this is your poaching liquid


### Step 2

Meanwhile, add the rice, 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a matching lid, over a high heat

Cover and cook for 10 min, or until almost all the water is absorbed


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)

Add the ginger to the poaching liquid


### Step 4

Cut each fish fillet into 3 equal portions and season generously with salt and pepper

Pick the leaves off the coriander stalks and set them aside for garnish

Chop the stems finely and add them to the poaching liquid


### Step 5

Carefully add each piece of fish to the pan of poaching liquid, trying not to overlap them

Cook for 8 min, carefully flipping the fish halfway through for even cooking


### Step 6

Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms finely

Add the mushrooms and fish sauce to the pan (while the fish poaches)


### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the poached fish to a plate (it's OK if you get some mushrooms)

Add the cooked rice to the poaching liquid, stir to combine - this is your tom kha rice

### Step 8

Divide the tom kha rice between your bowls and top with the poached fish

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy! (don't eat the lime leaves)
