### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a medium heat and once hot, add the walnuts and toast for 3-4 min or until they've slightly darkened in colour


Once toasted, transfer the walnuts to a chopping board to cool (keep the pan for later!)

Deseed the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


Dice the tomatoes finely


### Step 3

Return the pan with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;to a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;chicken strips&nbsp;and cook for 2 min


Add the&nbsp;ras el hanout, chopped tomato and&nbsp;yellow pepper&nbsp;and cook&nbsp;for a further 2 min or until&nbsp;beginning to brown


### Step 4

Add the couscous, cover, and set aside until serving


Meanwhile, dissolve the tomato paste, honey and remaining chicken&nbsp;stock cube in 350ml<span class="text-danger"> [700ml]</span> boiled water&nbsp;&ndash; this is your honey&nbsp;stock


### Step 5

Once browned, add the honey&nbsp;stock to the chicken&nbsp;and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 3-4 min

Meanwhile, fluff the couscous with a fork and add a generous drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil


Season&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and pepper

### Step 8
