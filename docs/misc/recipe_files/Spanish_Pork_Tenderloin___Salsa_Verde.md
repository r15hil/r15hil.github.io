## Description

This is a simple low-calorie Spanish roast. You'll rub pork tenderloin with dried oregano and pan-fry it gently. Instead of gravy, you'll make a salsa verde (green sauce) from fresh parsley, shallot, garlic and olive oil. Served with a sweet and sour stuffed pepper and smoky sweet potato cubes.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Dice the sweet&nbsp;potatoes (skins on)&nbsp;


Add the diced sweet potatoes to a baking tray, drizzle them with&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;and scatter the&nbsp;smoked paprika over


Season them with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until cooked through and crispy


### Step 2

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span><span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>


Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;


### Step 3

Add the&nbsp;halved peppers to a baking tray and stuff them with the&nbsp;diced tomato and&nbsp;half of the chopped shallot


Drizzle them with the&nbsp;red wine vinegar


Season them with a pinch of both salt and pepper and drizzle generously with olive oil


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until they have softened and wrinkled at the edges - these are your sweet and sour peppers&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Chop the parsley finely,&nbsp;including the stalks&nbsp;


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Add the chopped parsley to a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil


Grind to a paste, then add the&nbsp;chopped garlic, Dijon mustard and remaining&nbsp;chopped shallot


Stir in 3-4 tbsp olive oil&nbsp;- this is your salsa verde&nbsp;


### Step 6

Scatter the dried oregano and a large pinch of salt&nbsp;over a clean chopping board&nbsp;


Pat the pork tenderloin dry and roll it in the salty dried oregano


Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;herby&nbsp;pork&nbsp;and cook for 2 min, turning occasionally until lightly browned &nbsp;


### Step 7

Once the pork has browned, reduce the heat to medium, add a splash of water, cover with a lid and cook for 8-10 min, turning once half way through


Once cooked, transfer the&nbsp;cooked pork to a chopping board, cover with a tea towel and set aside to rest for 3 min


Tip: resting the meat helps it to relax and keeps it juicy!


Once rested, slice the pork tenderloin

### Step 8

Serve the sliced pork over the salsa verde&nbsp;with the smoky&nbsp;sweet potatoes and sweet and sour roasted pepper to the side&nbsp;


Enjoy!
