It’s an island affair with these Greek-style lean pork kebabs. You’ll add a touch of aromatic baharat to succulent lean pork and serve alongside creamy tzatziki. Then rustle up a roasted tomato and fruity rice to bring this sun-baked speciality together.

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and slice your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

### Step 2

Add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!), baharat and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a medium bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the lean pork mixture into 2 per person and roll into sausage shapes – these are your spiced lean pork kebabs

### Step 3

Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper

Add the spiced lean pork kebabs to one side of the tray[s]

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and red onion wedges to the other side and sprinkle over your dried oregano with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give the veg a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the kebabs are cooked through and the tomatoes have softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice and sultanas to a pot with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 5

While the rice is cooking, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grate your cucumber

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1717664185376-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), half the chopped mint (save the rest for later!) and grated cucumber to a separate bowl with your natural yoghurt and the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and stir it all together – this is your tzatziki

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1718797011896-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Once the veg is cooked, fluff up the rice and stir through the roasted veg, your chicken stock mix, lemon zest, remaining chopped mint and a pinch of salt – this is your fruity rice

### Step 8

Serve the spiced lean pork kebabs with the fruity rice to the side

Add a dollop of tzatziki and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
