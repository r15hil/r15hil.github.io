## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened


### Step 2

Whilst the onion is softening, chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic and ginger

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>boiled water and add the tomato paste – this is your tomato stock


### Step 3

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, ground paprika, half of the chopped ginger (save the rest for later!) and most of the curry powder (reserve half a<span class="text-danger"> </span>tsp per person for the fish!) and cook for 1-2 min

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes and tomato stock and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have broken down


### Step 4

Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high

Add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 5

Meanwhile, cut the basa fillet[s] into rough bite-sized pieces

Combine half of the natural yoghurt (you’ll use the rest later!) with the reserved curry powder, remaining chopped ginger, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl

Add the chopped basa to the bowl and give it a good mix up until fully coated – this is your spice-coated basa

Reboil a full kettle


### Step 6

Add the spice-coated basa to a tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray under the grill for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and slightly charred – this is your basa tikka

While the fish is cooking, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt


### Step 7

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly

Add the chopped spinach to the pan and give it a good mix up

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through the remaining natural yoghurt  – this is your masala sauce

### Step 8

Serve the basa tikka over the masala sauce with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
