## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil half a kettle


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until starting to break down


### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop any larger pieces of your meat-free chick'n into bite-sized pieces


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your garam masala, ground fenugreek and ground paprika and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, raise the heat to medium-high add your meat-free chick'n to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Tip: Add an extra drizzle of vegetable oil if the meat-free chick'n is looking a little dry!

Once the meat-free chick'n is warmed through, add the tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your warming meat-free chick'n bhuna


### Step 7

While the meat-free bhuna is cooking, chop your coriander finely

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the warming meat-free chick'n bhuna with the basmati rice and warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!
