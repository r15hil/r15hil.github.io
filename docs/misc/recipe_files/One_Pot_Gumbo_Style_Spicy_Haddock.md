### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-5 min or until the onion has softened and is starting to turn translucent

### Step 3

While the onion is softening, deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

### Step 4

Add the sliced pepper, smoked paprika, bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan

Sprinkle in the vegetable stock mix and cook for 30 secs

### Step 5

Add the white long grain rice and cook for a further 30 secs, stirring so that all of the grains are coated in the spices

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/812.-step-6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Add half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> of the wholegrain mustard, Henderson’s Relish, a pinch of sugar and 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to the pan and give everything a good stir

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining wholegrain mustard for another recipe!

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

### Step 7

Meanwhile, season the haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the rice is cooked, sit the haddock bites on top of the rice, then add a knob of butter, cover and cook for a further 3 min or until the haddock is cooked through – this is your one-pot gumbo-style spicy haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot gumbo-style spicy haddock in bowls

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
