Once the chicken has browned, stir the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, half of the soy sauce, and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed, the rice is cooked and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indonesian-style chicken rice

Garnish with the remaining spring onion greens, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the lime wedges

Enjoy!
