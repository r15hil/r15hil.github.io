### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them with half the berbere seasoning (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick and with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the seasoned chicken, skin-side down and cook for 7-8 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

### Step 2

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice half the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the remaining onion finely

Chop the tomatoes finely

Drain and rinse the green lentils

### Step 3

Once the chicken skin has crisped, transfer the browned chicken to a baking paper-lined tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy berbere chicken

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Wash the sliced spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 5

Once softened, add the ginger & garlic paste with the remaining berbere seasoning, the ground smoked paprika, drained green lentils and chopped tomatoes

Cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 450ml <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water with the chicken stock mix, tomato paste and a generous pinch of salt

### Step 6

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are tender – these are your Ethiopian-style lentils

Reboil half a kettle

### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Once softened, add the sliced garlic and sliced spring greens with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 10-12 min or until very tender – these are your braised greens

### Step 8

Serve the crispy berbere-spiced chicken over the Ethiopian-style lentils with the braised greens to the side

Enjoy!
