### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, sliced pepper and a pinch of salt then cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften


### Step 3

While the onion and peppers are cooking, add the tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the tortiglioni

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 4

Slice the cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve the tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 5

Once the onion and peppers have softened, add the tomato stock to the pan with the halved cherry tomatoes and dried oregano and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened

Drain the tuna

Once the sauce has thickened, stir the cooked tortiglioni and drained tuna through the tomato sauce and season generously with black pepper


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Drain the mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Transfer the pasta to an oven-proof dish and top with the grated cheddar and torn mozzarella

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden on top – this is your cheesy tuna pasta bake

Roughly tear the basil leaves

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy tuna pasta bake and garnish with the torn basil leaves

Enjoy!
