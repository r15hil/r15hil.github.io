## Ingredients

- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Chives (5g)
- Blanched peas (160g)
- Fine green beans (160g)
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Fine green beans (80g) x0
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min

Once done, drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Meanwhile, melt 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g]</span> butter in a separate pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 230ml <span class="text-purple">[345ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[460ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce


### Step 3

Chop your lemon[s] into wedges

Chop your chives finely

Chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into rough bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add the chopped chives, the juice of half your lemon wedge[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and a pinch of salt and pepper to the béchamel sauce

Give everything a good mix up


### Step 5

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt to the drained potatoes and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Don't worry if the potatoes break up a bit!


### Step 6

Add the smoked basa pieces to an oven-proof dish, then pour the béchamel sauce over the smoked basa

Top with the drained potatoes (reserve the pot) and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once the bake is golden and bubbling, reboil a kettle

Remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for 5-6 mins – this is your smoky fish & potato bake

Meanwhile, add your trimmed green beans and blanched peas to the reserved pot with a pinch of salt

Cover with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5 min or until tender – this is your green veg

### Step 8

Serve the smoky fish & potato bake with the green veg and a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
