## Ingredients

- Panko breadcrumbs (20g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (160g)
- Dijon mustard (5.5g)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Tenderstem broccoli (80g) x0
- Tortiglioni (75g) x0
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Garlic clove
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Leek
- Pumpkin seeds (15g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Tortiglioni (150g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 4-5 min

Reboil half a kettle


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 3

After an initial 4-5 min, add your Tenderstem broccoli to the tortiglioni and cook for a further 3-4 min or until everything is cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g] </span>butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced leek[s] and cook for 5-6 min or until softened, then add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml] </span>boiled water and add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock


### Step 5

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min

Gradually whisk in the creamy stock and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once thick, stir through the grated cheddar cheese, half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) and your Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) – this is your cheese sauce


### Step 6

Combine the remaining grated Italian hard cheese with your panko breadcrumbs, pumpkin seeds and a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

Add the drained tortiglioni & Tenderstem to the cheese sauce and stir it all together

Transfer to an oven-proof dish and top with the cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and bubbling


### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the dressing and gently mix together – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!) – this is your cheesy broccoli pasta bake

Serve with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
