## Description

This method for creating an ‘open’ lasagne celebrates all the joy of rich beef lasagne, minus the hours of oven time. You simply layer the cooked beef ragu and pasta sheets onto your plates, sprinkling with cheese and basil as you go. We like to think of it as lazy lasagne!

## Ingredients

- 40g Irish mature cheddar
- 1 tbsp Italian balsamic vinegar
- 300g British beef mince
- 100g carrots
- 2 tbsp rich tomato paste
- 1 beef stock cube
- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 6 lasagne verdi sheets
- 10g fresh basil
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle and add the boiled water to a pot with a pinch of salt&nbsp;


Add the&nbsp;lasagne verdi sheets,&nbsp;one at a time,&nbsp;with a drizzle of olive oil between each one (this stops them sticking together)


Cook for 12 min or until they have softened&nbsp;


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Peel and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 3

Heat&nbsp;a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1-2 tbsp olive oil over a high heat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the chopped&nbsp;carrot and cook for 30 sec&nbsp;


Add the beef mince, break it up with a wooden spoon and cook for a further 30 sec


Add the chopped&nbsp;garlic and cook for a further 3 min, or until the meat is no longer pink


### Step 4

Crumble the&nbsp;beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into the beef mince


Add the tomato paste, 1/2 tsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1&nbsp;tsp]</span>&nbsp;sugar and the balsamic vinegar


Reduce the heat to medium and cook for a further 4 min&nbsp;


Meanwhile, chop the chestnut&nbsp;mushrooms into quarters


### Step 5

Add approx. 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span>&nbsp;of the starchy pasta water (that your lasagne sheets are cooking in) to the mince


Add the chopped&nbsp;mushrooms


Cook for a further 5 min or until the mushrooms are tender and the sauce has thickened


Season with salt and pepper &ndash;&nbsp;this is your ragu


### Step 6

Chop (or tear)&nbsp;the basil finely, including the stalks


Grate the&nbsp;cheddar cheese


### Step 7

Check the lasagne verdi sheets are cooked


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot with a little&nbsp;starchy pasta water (this prevents them from sticking together)

### Step 8

To serve, place a lasagne sheet on each plate and spoon over some of the ragu


Sprinkle some grated cheese and chopped basil over, then repeat with the remaining lasagne sheets


Enjoy!
