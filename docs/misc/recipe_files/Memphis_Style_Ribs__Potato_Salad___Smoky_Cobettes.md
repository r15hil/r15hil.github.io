## Ingredients

- 30ml mayonnaise
- 20g mustard ketchup
- 2g smoked sea salt flakes
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 450g slow cooked pork ribs
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 sweetcorn cobettes
- 3 white potatoes
- 5g chives
- 30ml cider vinegar
- 25g honey
- 2 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry


### Step 2

Take 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>butter out of the fridge and set aside to warm up 

Combine 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), with half the smoked paprika and half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your vinegar mop

Tip: In Southern BBQ a mop sauce is used to baste barbecued meats to infuse the meat with flavour while it cooks


### Step 3

Add the slow cooked pork ribs to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray and drizzle over half the vinegar mop (or use a cooking brush!)

Add the cobettes to the other side of the baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the cobettes have begun to char

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 4

While the ribs and cobettes are in the oven, add the honey and smoked sea salt to the remaining vinegar mop and stir it together – this is your smoky glaze


### Step 5

Combine the remaining cider vinegar, mustard ketchup and mayo in a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and whisk everything together – this is your potato salad dressing

Add the remaining smoked paprika and a pinch of salt to the warmed butter and mix everything together – this is your smoky butter


### Step 6

Trim then finely slice the spring onions and chives

After an initial 20 min, remove the ribs from the oven and pour the smoky glaze all over (or use a cooking brush!)

Add half the smoky butter (you'll use the rest later!) to the cobettes and return the tray to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the ribs are sticky and the cobettes are slightly charred


### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the cooked potatoes, sliced spring onions and half the chopped chives (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the potato salad dressing and gently stir everything together – this is your potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the Memphis-style ribs with the potato salad and smoky cobettes to the side

Add the remaining smoky butter to the cobettes and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!
