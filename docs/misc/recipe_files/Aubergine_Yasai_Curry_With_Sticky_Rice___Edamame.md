## Ingredients

- 150g sushi rice
- 1 tamari soy sauce sachet (15ml)
- 80g edamame beans
- 6g cornflour
- 200g sweet potato
- 1 apple
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic clove
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1 aubergine
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Peel and chop the sweet potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces


Top and tail the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then slice into half moons


Add both to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put into the oven for 18-20 min or until tender


### Step 2

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully


Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!


### Step 3

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min


After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice


Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get perfectly fluffy rice!


### Step 4

<span class="text-highlight">While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle</span>


Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once the pan is hot, add the sliced onion and grated apple with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


Meanwhile, add the cornflour and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water to a small bowl and stir it all together


### Step 6

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, ginger and curry powder and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant


Add the tamari and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water with the cornflour mixture to the pan


Cook for a further 3-4 min, whisking continuously, until the sauce has thickened


### Step 7

Once thickened, add the cooked sweet potatoes and aubergines to the pan and gently stir it all together – this is your aubergine yasai curry


Meanwhile, add the edamame beans to a bowl with a pinch of salt and microwave for 1 min or until hot and cooked with a bite


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

### Step 8

Serve the aubergine yasai curry with the sushi rice and edamame beans to the side


Garnish with the sliced spring onions


Enjoy!
