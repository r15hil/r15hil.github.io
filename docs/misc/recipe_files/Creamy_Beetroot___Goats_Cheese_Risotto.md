- Hazelnuts (25g)
- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)
- Basil (5g)
- Garlic clove x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then chop your hazelnuts roughly

Heat a large, dry pan over a medium heat and once hot, add the hazelnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once lightly golden, transfer them to a chopping board, reserving the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!


### Step 2

Peel and finely chop your shallots

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter

Once hot, add the chopped shallot, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the shallot has softened


### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Add your arborio rice and Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 1 min or until the Chinese rice wine has evaporated

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 4

Once the rice is cooking, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain your beetroot in a colander over the sink

Chop half the beetroot into small bite-sized pieces

Add the remaining beetroot to a food processor with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blend until a smooth purée forms


### Step 5

Add the chopped beetroot to a tin foil-lined baking tray and drizzle with a little olive oil

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until tender and starting to brown


### Step 6

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Crumble your goats' cheese into rough bite-sized pieces

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with half your cider vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of pepper and toss – this is your dressed salad


### Step 7

Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat

Add the beetroot purée to the pan with your grated Italian hard cheese, half the goats' cheese, the remaining cider vinegar and most of the chopped basil (you’ll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy beetroot risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!

### Step 8

Top the creamy beetroot risotto with the remaining crumbled goats' cheese, roasted beetroot, toasted hazelnuts and remaining chopped basil

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
