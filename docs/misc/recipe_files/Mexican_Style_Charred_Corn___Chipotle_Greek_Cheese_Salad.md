## Ingredients

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Cherry tomatoes (125g)
- Gem lettuce
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Black beans (185g)
- Green chilli
- Sweetcorn cobettes (2pcs)
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Carrot
- Coriander (10g)
- Coriander (5g) x0
- Spring onion x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium high heat

Once hot, add your sweetcorn cobette[s] and cook for 15 min, turning throughout, or until cooked through and lightly charred on all sides, then once done, remove from the pan and set aside to cool

Tip: Use tongs to move the corn around for even charring


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a drizzle of vegetable oil in a bowl – this is your chipotle marinade

Lightly oil a baking tray with a little vegetable oil

Brush some of the chipotle marinade (save the remaining marinade for later) over your Greek cheese, until evenly coated on all sides then add to one side of the lightly-oiled baking tray


### Step 3

Drain and rinse your black beans

Add the drained black beans to the bowl with the remaining chipotle marinade and give them a good mix up

Add the chipotle black beans to the other side of the tray with the Greek cheese

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until the beans are crispy and the Greek cheese is soft


### Step 4

While everything's cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 5

Add the chopped coriander and chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a bowl with the juice of the lime[s], your mayo, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your zingy lime dressing


### Step 6

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Top, tail, and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 7

Once the charred corn has cooled slightly, stand it upright on a chopping board and carefully slice the charred corn kernels from the cob[s] using a sharp knife

Add the charred corn kernels to a bowl with the shredded lettuce, grated carrot, sliced tomatoes and sliced spring onion

Add the zingy lime dressing to the bowl and toss everything together – this is your Mexican-style charred corn salad

### Step 8

Serve the Mexican-style charred corn salad topped with the crispy black beans and chipotle baked Greek cheese

Enjoy!
