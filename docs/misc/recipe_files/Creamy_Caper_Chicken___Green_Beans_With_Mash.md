## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 50g soft cheese
- 20g capers
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 4 white potatoes
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 320g British skinless chicken thighs
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel the potatoes and chop them into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Season the chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add the chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned


### Step 3

Whilst the chicken is browning, peel and finely slice (don't chop) the garlic

Trim, then chop the green beans in half

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Add the sliced garlic with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook, covered for an initial 7-8 min


### Step 5

Add the chopped green beans to the pan with the chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain and return them to the pot

Return the pot to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a large knob of butter

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth


### Step 7

Once the green beans are tender, add the soft cheese, Chinese rice wine, capers, Dijon mustard and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy caper chicken & green beans

### Step 8

Serve the creamy caper chicken & green beans with the mash to the side

Pour the remaining creamy caper sauce over the chicken and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
