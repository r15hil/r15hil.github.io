## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, then cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your cooked salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

While the salmon is cooking, combine your ginger paste and hoisin sauce in a bowl with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your hoisin glaze


### Step 4

Combine your mayo and toasted sesame oil in a large bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame mayo


### Step 5

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the sesame mayo and mix it all together – this is your sesame mayo slaw

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 6

Once the salmon is cooked through, peel the skin off the salmon and discard, then add the hoisin glaze to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Break the cooked salmon apart into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and give everything a good mix up

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds over the salmon – this is your ginger hoisin salmon


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the spinach, sesame mayo slaw and the ginger hoisin salmon

Garnish with your crispy onions and chopped spring onion

Enjoy!
