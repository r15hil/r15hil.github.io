### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> slices

Add the sliced ciabatta to a baking tray lined with tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until lightly toasted

### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve half the chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 120ml <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

### Step 3

Once hot, add half the chopped shallot and half the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then add the stock, chopped parsley, a small knob of butter and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1-2 min – this is your stock

Remove the toasted ciabatta from the oven (reserve the tray!), roughly tear it (careful it will be hot!) and add it to an oven-proof dish, then pour over the stock and set aside, reserving the pan – this is your herby bread stuffing

### Step 4

Using clean hands, combine the remaining chopped shallot and garlic, pork mince and panko breadcrumbs, season generously with salt and pepper then knead thoroughly until fully combined – this is your pork mixture

Add the pork mixture to the reserved baking tray and shape into 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>loaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>, spread half the cranberry sauce over the top of the meatloaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>, then put the tray and the herby bread stuffing in the oven for 30-35 min or until the meatloaf<span class="text-danger">[ves] </span>are cooked through and the stuffing is golden

### Step 5

While everything's in the oven, peel the potatoes and sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and chop them into small bite-sized pieces

Add all of the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 6

Reboil half a kettle, then cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper, then lay the green beans in the middle with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the beans to form a sealed parcel and put the parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 8-10 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter and once melted, add 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1635261785489-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whisk in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water, 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> milk, the remaining chicken stock mix, soy sauce, remaining cranberry sauce and half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> of the wholegrain mustard with a generous grind of black pepper, and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your cranberry gravy

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining wholegrain mustard for another recipe!

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, season with a generous pinch of salt and mash until smooth

### Step 8

Slice the meatloaf and serve with the sweet potato mash, herby bread stuffing and tender green beans to the side

Top the sweet potato mash with the pecan nuts and drizzle the cranberry gravy all over

Enjoy!
