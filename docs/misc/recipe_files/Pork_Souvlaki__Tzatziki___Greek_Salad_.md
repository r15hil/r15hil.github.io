## Description

Souvlaki is Greece's answer to the much loved grilled kebab. You'll coat tender British pork loin steaks in a honey and dried oregano marinade before grilling on skewers. Serve the souvlaki with all the essential additions: warm flatbreads, tzatziki and a tomato & cucumber salad for freshness.

- 1 tbsp dried oregano

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan) / gas 7

Tip: This is just to warm your flatbreads later (alternatively, just pop them in the toaster)

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Slice the pork loin steaks into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

### Step 2

Add the soy sauce, honey, dried oregano and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your marinade

Add the sliced pork steaks to the bowl and gently mix it all together then set aside to marinate

### Step 3

Meanwhile, deseed the cucumber (slice in half lengthways then scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Dice half the cucumber and grate the remainder

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large, bite-sized pieces

### Step 4

Add the diced tomato and diced cucumber to a bowl

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Greek salad

### Step 5

Preheat the grill to high

Thread the marinated pork and chopped green pepper evenly onto the soaked skewers

Add the skewers to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray under the grill for 12-14 min, turning once halfway through, or until everything's cooked through (no pink meat!) and slightly charred – this is your pork souvlaki

### Step 6

Meanwhile, squeeze the water out of the grated cucumber

Combine the grated cucumber, natural yoghurt and remaining chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Season with salt and pepper – this is your tzatziki

### Step 7

Once the pork souvlaki is almost done, add the plain naans to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until warmed through – these are your flatbreads

Tip: Alternatively pop them straight in your toaster to warm through

### Step 8

Slice the warmed flatbreads into triangles

Serve the pork souvlaki with the warmed flatbreads, Greek salad and tzatziki to the side

Enjoy!
