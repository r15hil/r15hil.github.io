## Ingredients

- 0 brown long grain rice
- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 25g agave nectar 	
- 100g brown rice
- 15g fresh root ginger 
- 15ml soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 160g blanched edamame beans
-  26g smooth peanut butter 
- 280g plain tofu
- 80g shredded kale
- 1/2 cucumber
- 0 soy sauce
- 1 lime

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ gas 5

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once done, add your blanched edamame beans and cook for 1 min further, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 2

Whilst the rice is cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the tofu into 4 slices per person

Add the tofu slices to a large bowl with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a very generous pinch of salt and toss gently until coated

Add the coated tofu to a lightly oiled tray (or two!) and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds


### Step 3

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the tofu is starting to crisp – this is your sesame tofu


### Step 4

Meanwhile, finely slice your cucumber

Add the cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled cucumber


### Step 5

Wash your shredded kale and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add the shredded kale to a large baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Massage the kale with clean hands so that the kale is evenly covered in oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-10 min or until crispy, giving it a good mix up half way through – this is your crispy kale


### Step 6

Add your peanut butter, soy sauce, agave, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and the juice of half your lime[s] to a bowl

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger, then add it to the bowl

Give it a good whisk up – this is your spicy peanut sauce

Tip: If it looks like its split, keep whisking and it will come together!


### Step 7

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the sesame tofu with the edamame brown rice, quick-pickled cucumber, crispy kale and a lime wedge to the side

Drizzle the spicy peanut sauce over the rice and sesame tofu

Enjoy!
