### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and shallot and cook for 30 secs

Remove the pan from the heat and let the garlic infuse the olive oil – this is your garlic & shallot oil

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Add the chopped tomato and parsley to a bowl with the garlic & shallot oil (reserve the pan)

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato relish

### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and season generously with salt and pepper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

### Step 7

Once hot, add the haddock bites with a knob of butter and cook for 5 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Add a large knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt to the pot with the drained potatoes, and crush them lightly with a fork

### Step 8

Slice the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the pan-fried haddock over the crushed potatoes with the tomato relish to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
