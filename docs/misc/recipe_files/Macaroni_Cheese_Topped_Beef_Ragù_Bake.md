## Ingredients

- 5.5g beef stock mix
- 40g mature cheddar 
- 20g rocket
- 32g tomato paste 
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 carrot
- 250g British beef mince
- 160g chestnut mushrooms
- 100g macaroni
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Add the macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the macaroni and reserve the pot for later


### Step 2

Reboil half a kettle

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tear the chestnut mushrooms into rough, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano and half of the balsamic vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) – this is your beef stock


### Step 4

Add the beef mince to the softened onion with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the torn mushrooms and chopped garlic and cook for 2 min further


### Step 5

Once browned, add the beef stock, grated carrot and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to the beef mince and cook for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your ragù

Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese


### Step 6

While the ragù is cooking, melt 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in the reserved pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk into the roux and whisk for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper – this is your béchamel


### Step 7

Add the drained macaroni and Dijon mustard to the béchamel and mix well – this is your macaroni cheese

Transfer the ragù to an oven-proof dish (or individual smaller ones) and top with the macaroni cheese

Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your ragù bake

### Step 8

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and toss through the rocket

Serve the ragù bake with the dressed rocket to the side

Enjoy!
