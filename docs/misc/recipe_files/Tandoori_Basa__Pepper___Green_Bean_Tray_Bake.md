- 390g chickpeas
- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tsp ground turmeric

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the sliced pepper to a baking tray lined with tin foil with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 6-7 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


### Step 3

Combine the chopped garlic and ginger with the ground paprika, ground coriander, ground turmeric, garam masala and half the natural yoghurt (you’ll use the rest later!) in a medium bowl

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tandoori marinade

Add the basa fillets to the tandoori marinade and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your tandoori basa


### Step 4

Trim, then chop the green beans in half

Drain and rinse the chickpeas


### Step 5

Once the peppers have begun to soften, remove the tray from the oven and switch from the oven setting to medium-high grill

Add the drained chickpeas and halved green beans with the ground cumin, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your spiced pepper & green beans


### Step 6

Lay the tandoori basa on top of the spiced pepper & green beans and put the tray under the grill for 12-15 min or until cooked through and lightly charred – this is your tandoori basa, pepper & green bean tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

While the fish is cooking, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the remaining natural yoghurt in a bowl with the chopped coriander and the juice of the remaining lemon

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your coriander yoghurt

### Step 8

Serve the tandoori basa, pepper & green bean tray bake

Dollop over the coriander yoghurt

Enjoy!
