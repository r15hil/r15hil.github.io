## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 brioche rolls 
- 1 corn salad punnet (100g)
- 50g stilton cheese
- 200g British turkey thigh mince 
- 1 mayonnaise sachet (26ml)
- 30g dried cranberries

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Chop the cranberries finely


Crumble the blue cheese into small pieces


Reserve 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(4 tbsp)</span> of crumbled blue cheese for stuffing the patties (step 3)


### Step 2

Set aside a clean board or plate for shaping the patties later


Add the turkey mince and chopped cranberries to a mixing bowl


Season with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">(1 tsp)</span> of salt and 1/4 tsp <span class="text-danger">(1/2 tsp)</span> of pepper


Wet your hands, mix thoroughly and shape into 2 <span class="text-danger">(4)</span> balls


### Step 3

Make a shallow indent with your fingers into the centre of each ball and stuff with 1 tbsp of the reserved blue cheese


Cover the indent with the mince by folding it over


Pat and shape the stuffed patties into 2cm thick burgers -- covering the cheese completely


### Step 4

Heat a wide pan (preferably non stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the burgers and cook for 3 min on each side, or until coloured, then reserve the pan


Transfer them to an oven tray and cook in the oven for an additional 8 min, or until cooked through


### Step 5

Meanwhile, add the remaining crumbled blue cheese and vinegar to a small bowl then mash together with a spoon into a rough paste


Mix in the mayonnaise, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of milk and a pinch of pepper - this is your blue cheese dressing


### Step 6

Wash and dry the corn salad thoroughly


Once cooked through, remove the burgers from the oven to rest until serving


### Step 7

Meanwhile, wipe down the burger pan and return to a medium-high heat


Slice the brioche in half widthways


Add the halves cut-side-down in the pan and cook for 2-3 min, until toasted


Tip: Do this in batches if needed!

### Step 8

Serve the burger in the toasted brioche with the salad and dressing to the side


Enjoy!
