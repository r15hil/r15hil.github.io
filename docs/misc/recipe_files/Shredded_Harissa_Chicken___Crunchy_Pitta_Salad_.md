### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat, then boil half a kettle

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

### Step 2

Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the chicken has browned, add the harissa stock to the pan

Cook, covered, for a further 12-15 min, turning the chicken halfway, until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the stock has reduced

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, chop your wholemeal pitta[s] into rough bite-sized triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil, a pinch of salt and your ground sumac

Give it a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crunchy pitta

### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Combine your mayo with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl

Give it a good mix up until it's smooth – this is your lemony dressing

### Step 6

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the sauce – this is your shredded harissa chicken

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1630493368122-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Wash your baby leaf salad, then add to a large bowl with the grated carrot, sliced cucumber, tomato wedges, crunchy pitta and most of the chopped mint and dill (save some for garnish!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and the juice from the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your crunchy pitta salad

### Step 8

Serve the shredded harissa chicken over the crunchy pitta salad

Drizzle with the lemony dressing and garnish with the remaining chopped mint and dill

Enjoy!
