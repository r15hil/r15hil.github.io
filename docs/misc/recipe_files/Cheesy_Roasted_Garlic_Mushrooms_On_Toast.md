## Instructions


### Step 1

Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Once done, simply dig in or wrap up ready for your day!


### Step 2

Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until browned


### Step 4

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted


### Step 5

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can


### Step 6

Once the mushrooms have browned, add your roasted garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 7

Once fragrant, add half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) – these are your cheesy roasted garlic mushrooms

### Step 8

Top the toasted ciabatta with your soft cheese, wilted spinach and the cheesy roasted garlic mushrooms

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a grind of black pepper

Time to start your day!
