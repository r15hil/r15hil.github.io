### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Add your smoked streaky bacon to one side on a separate baking paper-lined tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 3

While the bacon is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Combine your curry powder and tomato ketchup in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your curried ketchup

### Step 4

Heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste, garam masala, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste and cook for an initial 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of sugar, stir it all together and cook for a further 1-2 min – this is your masala sauce

### Step 5

After 15 min, remove the tray[s] with the crispy bacon from the oven and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the baking tray[s], cut side up, and return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min or until the brioche is toasted and the cheese has melted

### Step 6

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg[s] a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk[s]!

### Step 7

Once the chips are golden, return the masala sauce to a medium heat and add the chips and half the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pot

Give everything a good mix up until the chips are fully coated in the sauce – these are your masala chips

### Step 8

To build, top the toasted brioche base with the cheesy bacon, fried egg, a drizzle of curried ketchup and remaining chopped coriander

Top with the toasted brioche lid and serve with the masala chips to the side

Enjoy!
