## Ingredients

- 40g cheddar cheese
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 390g black beans
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
-  2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 1 avocado
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel and slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> thickly

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften


### Step 3

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Boil half a kettle


### Step 4

Once the onion has begun to soften, add the sliced garlic with the smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your fajita spice base

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until the garlic has slightly softened

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and sliced pepper with a small splash of boiled water and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes begin to blister


### Step 5

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans

Add half the black beans with a small pinch of salt to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until the beans pop – these are your popped beans

Add the remaining black beans to the pan with the vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water, mix everything together and cook for 2 min further


### Step 6

Grate the cheddar cheese

Make 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wells in the pan and crack the eggs into them, then cook covered for 2-3 min or until the eggs are done to your liking – this is your fajita-spiced shakshuka


### Step 7

While the eggs are cooking, cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways

### Step 8

Serve the fajita-spiced shakshuka with the sliced avocado to the side

Top with the grated cheese and sprinkle over the popped beans

Enjoy!
