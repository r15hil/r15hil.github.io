## Ingredients

- British lamb mince (125g) x0
- British lamb mince (250g)
- Beef stock mix (5.5g)
- Bulgur wheat (65g) x0
- Finely chopped tomatoes (200g)
- Greek salad cheese (100g)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Carrot
- Bulgur wheat (130g)
- Parsley (5g)
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and grate your red onion[s]


### Step 2

Combine your lamb mince, half of the grated onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape the lamb mince into 3 meatballs per person


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, until they're browned all over

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside (these will finish cooking in the sauce later!), then return the pan to a medium-low heat


### Step 4

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Once the pan is hot, add the grated carrot and remaining grated onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until softened

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Reboil a kettle


### Step 5

Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the chopped tomatoes, dried oregano, beef stock and a pinch of sugar to the pan and cook for 8-10 min or until reduced to a thick sauce

Once thickened, transfer the sauce to an oven-proof dish and add the lamb meatballs

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min until the sauce is bubbling and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek-style lamb meatball bake


### Step 6

While the meatballs are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


### Step 7

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, roughly crumble your Greek cheese on a clean chopping board

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the Greek-style lamb meatball bake over the bulgur wheat

Sprinkle over the Greek cheese and chopped parsley

Enjoy!
