Combine the black bean paste, Chinese rice wine, chopped ginger and garlic with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>water – this is your black bean sauce

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>A3 sized<span class="text-danger"> </span>pieces of tin foil and lay the first piece of foil onto the tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the veg has softened and the fish is cooked through – this is your black bean salmon & veg

Once drained, return the noodles to the pot and set aside

Pour the remaining black bean sauce from the parcels all over and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
