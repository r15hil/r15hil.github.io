## Ingredients

- Puff pastry (160g)
- Diced chorizo (100g)
- Ground smoked paprika (2tsp)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp) x0
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- Diced chorizo (50g) x0
- Garlic clove
- Cider vinegar (15ml)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Tomato x2
- Baby leaf salad (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop (or grate!) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic and soft cheese in a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>warm water and a generous grind of black pepper

Stir it all together – this is your soft cheese mix


### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es] in half

Slice the tomato halves into thin slices


### Step 3

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person


### Step 4

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!


### Step 5

Spread the soft cheese mix over the pastry, keeping it within the borders

Top with the sliced tomato, then put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the tomato starts to soften


### Step 6

After an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top the pastry with your diced chorizo

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 6-8 min or until the chorizo is crisped, the pastry is golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your chorizo & tomato tart


### Step 7

While the tart is cooking, combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the dressing and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Serve the chorizo & tomato tart with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!
