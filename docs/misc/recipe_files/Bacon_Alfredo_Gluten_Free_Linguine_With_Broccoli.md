- Grated Italian hard cheese (30g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Cut your broccoli into small florets

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add the broccoli florets to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until beginning to char

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for an initial 5-6 min, stirring frequently, or until starting to brown


### Step 4

Add your gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine, reserving a little of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the bacon is starting to brown, add the chopped garlic and dried oregano and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock with your soft cheese and cornflour and a generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened


### Step 6

While the sauce is thickening, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Once thickened, remove from the heat, then add in half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and stir until melted


### Step 7

Add the drained linguine and charred broccoli florets with a few splashes of starchy pasta water and a generous knob of butter and mix until creamy and combined – this is your bacon alfredo gluten free linguine with broccoli

### Step 8

Serve the bacon alfredo gluten free linguine with broccoli topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the chopped basil

Enjoy!
