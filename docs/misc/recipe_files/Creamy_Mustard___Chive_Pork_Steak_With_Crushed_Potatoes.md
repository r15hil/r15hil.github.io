### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, skim through these steps then wash your fruit and veg

Take your pork loin steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary, and if you like your steak well-done, it may take you a little longer than 10 min

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat and boil half a kettle

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and rub them with a little vegetable oil and salt on both sides

Once hot, add the seasoned steak and cook on one side for 3 min or until browned

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-8 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the potatoes are fork-tender

### Step 4

Top, tail and slice your leek[s] into chunky rounds

Wash to remove any grit from between the leaves

Chop your chives finely

### Step 5

Once the pork steak is browned on one side, reduce the heat to medium-high, flip and cook 1 min further

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water

Add the chicken stock and sliced leeks to the pan and cook, covered, for 4 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Once the potatoes are tender, add a knob of butter with a pinch of salt and pepper and roughly crush with a fork – these are your crushed potatoes

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 7

Once the pork steak is cooked through, add your wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!), your soft cheese and the chopped chives and cook, uncovered, for 1 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy mustard & chive pork steak

Season generously with pepper

### Step 8

Serve the creamy mustard & chive pork steak with the crushed potatoes and salad to the side

Spoon over any remaining creamy mustard & chive sauce

Enjoy!
