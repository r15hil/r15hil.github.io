### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Meanwhile, add your pork mince (removed the paper if required), panko breadcrumbs and soy sauce to a bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!)

### Step 4

While the burger patty is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into thin strips

Chop your cucumber into discs

Slice each cucumber disc into matchsticks

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!

### Step 7

Once the brioche is toasted, wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium heat

Add your hoisin sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and cook for 1 min or until warmed through

Sprinkle your black sesame seeds over the chips – these are your black sesame chips

### Step 8

Top your toasted brioche base with a pork patty, a drizzle of warmed hoisin sauce, some cucumber salad, spring onion strips and the brioche lid

Serve any remaining cucumber salad and the black sesame chips to the side

Enjoy!
