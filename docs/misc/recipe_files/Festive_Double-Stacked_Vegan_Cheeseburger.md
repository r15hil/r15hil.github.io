### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into thin chips

### Step 2

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and your dried sage

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until they are golden and crispy – these are your festive fries

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water

### Step 3

Heat a pot over a medium heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk the vegetable stock into the roux (a little at a time!) and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your gravy

### Step 4

Once the festive fries have been cooking for 10-15 min, add your meat-free patties to a baking paper-lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the patties have started to brown

Once the patties have started to brown, top half of the patties<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your cheese flavour slices and return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted

### Step 5

Whilst the burgers are in the oven, cut the ends off your ciabatta[s] and slice in half

Tip: Don’t chuck the crusts away. Instead, turn them into croutons!

Slice your brioche buns in half

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1604315148774-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced ciabatta, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Once done, add the sliced brioche buns, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Tip: You'll need to do this in batches!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1604315152952-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once everything is almost done, add the toasted ciabatta to the gravy and set aside for 1-2 min or until it's started to soak up the gravy

### Step 8

Spread the brioche bases and lids with your mayo and cranberry sauce

Top the brioche base with some shredded lettuce, the cheesy patty, gravy-soaked ciabatta, remaining patty, more shredded lettuce and the brioche lid

Skewer the burger and serve the festive fries and any remaining gravy to the side

Enjoy!
