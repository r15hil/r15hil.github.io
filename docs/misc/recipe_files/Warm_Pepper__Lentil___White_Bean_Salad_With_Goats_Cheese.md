### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

### Step 7

Combine the juice of half your lemon wedge[s] with your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl – this is your zesty dressing

Add the zesty dressing to the pan with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your warm pepper, lentil & white bean salad

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the warm pepper, lentil & white bean salad with the halved cherry tomatoes and salad over the top

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley, a lemon wedge and an extra drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over your goats' cheese

Enjoy!
