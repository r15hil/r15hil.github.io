## Ingredients

- 1 chicken stock mix
- 1 chicken stock mix
- 50g soft cheese
- 1 puff pastry
- 250g British diced chicken thigh
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 carrot
- 21g wholegrain mustard
- 1 leek
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown


### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the chicken has browned add the diced onion, sliced leek, diced carrot and chopped garlic

Season with salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the carrot has softened slightly

Once softened, stir through 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour and your dried oregano and cook for a further 30 secs


### Step 4

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>boiled water with your wholegrain mustard and soft cheese  – this is your creamy mustard stock

Add the creamy mustard stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened slightly – this is your creamy chicken, leek & carrot pie filling


### Step 5

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin then score in a criss-cross pattern across the top with a knife


### Step 6

Add the creamy chicken, leek & carrot pie filling to an oven-proof dish

Lay the puff pastry sheet over the pie dish and trim off any excess

Tip: Use any excess pastry to add decorations to the pie!

Press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish, then brush all over with milk


### Step 7

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the pastry is puffed up and golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy chicken, leek & carrot pie

### Step 8

Serve the creamy chicken, leek & carrot pie

Enjoy!
