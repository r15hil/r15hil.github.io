### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 4

Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Once the spices are fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix, spinach and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min further or until the spinach starts to wilt

### Step 6

Once the spinach starts to wilt, add your chopped tomatoes and drained chickpeas to the pan with a pinch of pepper and cook for a further 3-5 min or until thickened – this is your spiced chickpea stew

### Step 7

While the stew is thickening, add your roasted peanuts to a bowl with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli-peanut crumb

### Step 8

Serve the spiced chickpea stew with the warmed ciabatta to the side

Top with a dollop of cultured coconut, then sprinkle over the chilli-peanut crumb

Enjoy!
