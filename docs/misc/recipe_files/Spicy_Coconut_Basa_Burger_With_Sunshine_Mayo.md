### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] and potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your fries

### Step 2

Slice half your red chilli[es] finely into rounds (you'll use the rest later!)

Zest your lime[s] and cut in half

Peel your garlic

Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/ tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl with the juice of half your zested lime[s] and the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli

### Step 3

Add the remaining chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the peeled garlic to a food processor with the lime zest, ground smoked paprika, ground turmeric, creamed coconut, ginger paste and the juice of the remaining lime

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your coconut marinade

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the ingredients and grind to a paste in a pestle & mortar instead!

### Step 4

Add your mayo to a small bowl with half the coconut marinade (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sunshine mayo

![Step 5 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-1697466239962-x200.jpg)

### Step 5

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut each fillet in half on a diagonal

Add the chopped basa to a large bowl with the remaining coconut marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut marinated basa

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1697466244517-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coconut marinated basa and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked through – this is your spicy coconut basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1697466249489-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add your brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Fill the warmed brioche with a handful of salad, the spicy coconut basa, a dollop of sunshine mayo and the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserve the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled chilli

Serve the remaining salad with a drizzle of olive oil and the reserved pickling liquid and set the fries and any remaining sunshine mayo to the side

Enjoy!
