## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool


### Step 2

Meanwhile, soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into thick rounds

Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large chunks

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into large wedges


### Step 3

Add the chopped veg to a large bowl, drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your curry powder to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated veg


### Step 4

Thread the coated veg onto the soaked skewers, alternating as you go

Add the veg skewers (and any remaining veg) to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and reserve the bowl

Sprinkle your sesame seeds over the veg skewers

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until everything has browned and is starting to char – these are your roasted veg skewers


### Step 5

Roll your lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine your cultured coconut in the reserved bowl with the juice of half the lime[s], your tamari soy sauce, sriracha and peanut butter

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy satay dressing


### Step 6

Wash, then shred your lettuce finely and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Combine the cooled rice and the shredded lettuce in a bowl with the remaining lime juice and a little drizzle of olive oil – this is your brown rice salad

### Step 8

Serve the roasted veg skewers over the brown rice salad

Serve the creamy satay dressing to the side

Enjoy!
