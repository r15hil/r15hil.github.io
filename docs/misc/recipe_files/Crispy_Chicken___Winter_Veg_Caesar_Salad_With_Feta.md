### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them on both sides with half your dried sage and a generous pinch of salt, then add skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

### Step 2

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways, then into batons

Drain your beetroot in a colander over the sink, then chop it roughly

Once browned, transfer the crispy chicken thighs, skin side up, to the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the veg is roasted and tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken & roast winter veg
