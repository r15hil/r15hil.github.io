### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-15 min or until beginning to brown

### Step 2

Whilst the fries are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 3

Combine your ground smoked paprika in a bowl with your ground cumin, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your spice mix

### Step 4

After an initial 10-15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push the fries to one side

Add your chicken breast strips, sliced onion and pepper strips to the other side of tray[s] with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Sprinkle your spice mix over the chicken and vegetables and give everything a good mix up until evenly coated

### Step 5

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a further 15-18 min or until the fries are golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 6

Whilst everything is cooking, peel and grate your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your mayo and grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a bowl with a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water – this is your garlic mayo

### Step 7

Once cooked, mix everything together then shape into 1 pile per person

Top the pile[s] with the grated cheese, then return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your loaded chicken & fries fajita tray bake

### Step 8

Serve the loaded chicken & fries fajita tray bake with the garlic mayo drizzled all over

Enjoy!
