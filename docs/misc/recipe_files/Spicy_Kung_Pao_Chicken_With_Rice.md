Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 3

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

### Step 4

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan or wok (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over

### Step 5

Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced garlic and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min further or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the sliced onion and chopped peppers and cook for 3-4 min further or until beginning to soften

### Step 6

Meanwhile, combine your cornflour, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and red chilli relish in a bowl with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your Kung Pao sauce

### Step 7

Once the veg has started to soften, add your roasted peanuts, ground coriander and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with a very generous grind of black pepper, then cook for 1-2 min further

Add the Kung Pao sauce to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy Kung Pao chicken

### Step 8

Serve the spicy Kung Pao chicken with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!
