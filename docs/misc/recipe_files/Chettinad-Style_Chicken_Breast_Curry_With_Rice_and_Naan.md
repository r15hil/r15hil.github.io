### Step 3

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your black mustard seeds and cumin seeds to the pan and cook for 1 min or until they start to pop

Add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is starting to soften

### Step 5

Boil half a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 5-6 min further or until the onion has caramelised

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1687250610001-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, chilli halves (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your cracked black pepper and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add your diced chicken breast and chicken stock and cook for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your Chettinad-style chicken breast curry

### Step 7

While the chicken is cooking, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the naan once warmed through

### Step 8

Serve the Chettinad-style chicken breast curry with the basmati rice and warmed naan to the side

Garnish with your chopped coriander

Enjoy!
