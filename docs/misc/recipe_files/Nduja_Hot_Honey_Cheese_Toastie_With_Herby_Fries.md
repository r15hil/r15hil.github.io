### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and most of your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby fries

### Step 2

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

### Step 3

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

### Step 4

Top the ciabatta base[s] with the sliced tomato, torn mozzarella and grated cheese

Tear over your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and drizzle over most of your honey (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of pepper

Place a ciabatta lid on top – this is your 'Nduja ciabatta

### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the 'Nduja ciabatta and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 4-5 min per side, checking occasionally or until the ciabatta is golden and the cheese has melted – this is your 'Nduja hot honey cheese toastie

### Step 6

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo and grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a small bowl with half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and the remaining dried oregano

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a small pinch of salt  – this is your garlic dip

### Step 7

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar and the remaining honey in a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your dressing

Add the salad and toss – this is your dressed salad

### Step 8

Cut the 'Nduja hot honey cheese toastie in half and serve with the herby fries, dressed salad and garlic dip to the side

Enjoy!
