### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Chop your potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel your parsnip[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons

Top, tail, peel and slice half your carrot[s] into discs

Peel and chop your red onion[s] in half, then cut half into wedges

### Step 2

Add the chopped vegetables to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a small pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and tender

Peel and finely dice the remaining carrot

Peel and finely dice the remaining onion

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 4

Once the onion and carrot is starting to soften, turn the heat up to high, then add your lean beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the chopped garlic, remaining ground turmeric, curry powder, mango chutney and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min

### Step 5

Add your beef stock mix, soy sauce, half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to medium-high, then cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened, then season with a generous grind of black pepper and transfer to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) – this is your pie mix

Dust your work surface generously with flour, unwrap your puff pastry, roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut to the size of your pie dish[es]

### Step 6

Lay the puff pastry over the dish[es], trim off any excess (use for fancy pie decorations!) and press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish[es]

Brush with a little water, add a few black mustard seeds to the top (you’ll use the rest later!), then put in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up, golden and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced lean beef & mango chutney pie

### Step 7

After the veg has had an initial 20-25 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, add a drizzle of vegetable oil and the remaining black mustard seeds and give everything a good mix up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min – this is your mustard seed veg

### Step 8

Serve the spiced lean beef & mango chutney pie with the mustard seed veg to the side

Top the veg with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!
