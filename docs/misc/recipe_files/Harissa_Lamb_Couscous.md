## Description

Harissa is a North African chilli paste, which is fragrant and a little bit spicy. It adds instant flavour to all manner of dishes, but works particularly well with lamb. Lamb in turn, works really well with aubergine. Here weâ€™ve got a super quick and tasty dish that features four essential Moroccan ingredients: lamb, harissa couscous and mint.

Discard the root end of the aubergine<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> and using a vegetable peeler, peel strips off the aubergine lengthways, leaving a gap between each strip (think zebra stripes)


Cut the aubergine into chunky rounds approx. 2cm thick

### Step 2

Heat a wide-based pan (non-stick is best) with 1-2 tbsp of vegetable oil


When hot, add the aubergine rounds, red onion, and a pinch of salt


Cook on a medium-low heat for 5 min, turning the aubergine half way, and once the aubergine is slightly browned, transfer both to a plate


Reserve the pan for the next step

### Step 3

Boil a kettle for steps 4 and 6


Add the ras el hanout to the reserved pan and cook for 20 sec, stirring constantly


Add the lamb mince and break it up with a wooden spoon


Cook the lamb in the spice for 5 min, or until starting to colour

### Step 4

Meanwhile, dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in 300ml <span class="text-danger">(500ml)</span> of boiled water


Add the harissa paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> of sugar to the stock


This is your harissa stock

### Step 5

Add the stock, the cooked aubergine and half of the red onion to the lamb pan, cover with a lid and cook on a rapid simmer for 10 min on a low heat


After the 10 min, remove the lid, turn the aubergines and cook for a further 5 min, or until most of the water has evaporated

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the couscous to a bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> of boiling water and cover well


Set aside for 10 min
