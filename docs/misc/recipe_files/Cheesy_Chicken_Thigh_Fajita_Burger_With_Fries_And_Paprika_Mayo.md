### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Transfer the browned chicken to one side of a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min, reserve the pan

### Step 3

While the chicken is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced pepper, sliced onion, ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

Once softened, remove from the heat and set aside – this is your fajita spiced onion & pepper

### Step 5

Grate your cheddar cheese

Cut your lime[s] in half

Cut half the lime[s] into wedges

### Step 6

After the chicken has had an initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and divide the grated cheese equally over the top of each chicken thigh – these are your cheesy chicken thighs

Slice your brioche style bun[s] in half, then add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return it to the oven for 2-3 min until the cheese has melted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, add the remaining ground smoked paprika to a bowl with your mayo and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your paprika mayo

### Step 8

Spread a dollop of paprika mayo over the brioche base, then top with the cheesy chicken thighs, fajita spiced onion & pepper and the brioche lid – this is your cheesy chicken thigh fajita burger

Serve the fries and remaining paprika mayo to the side and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!
