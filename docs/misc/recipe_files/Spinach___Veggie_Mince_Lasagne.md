## Description

This veggie lasagne takes on the classic with the aid of veggie mince! Veggie mince, much like tofu, needs flavouring. So we've used warm baharat spice mix, Henderson's relish, stock, caramelised onion and garlic to heighten the flavour. Layered with spinach and topped with a classic b√©chamel sauce.

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil over a low heat


Once hot, add the diced&nbsp;onion with a pinch of salt (to draw out the moisture) and cook for 10 min or until slightly softened and starting to brown


Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable&nbsp;stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 350ml<span class="text-danger">&nbsp;[700ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water, stir in the meat free mince, then set aside

### Step 3

Add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter to a pot over a medium heat


Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;flour and stir for 2-3 min or until a sandy&nbsp;paste has formed - this is your roux

### Step 4

Whisk 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span>&nbsp;milk gradually into the roux


Whisk&nbsp;constantly for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then remove from the heat


Grate in the&nbsp;cheddar cheese, return the pot to a low heat and stir until melted and smooth, then remove from the heat and set aside - this is your b&eacute;chamel sauce

### Step 5

Add the chopped&nbsp;garlic, baharat and tomato paste to the softened onion and stir for a further 2 min


Add the soaked meat free&nbsp;mince (including the stock), Henderson's relish, tomato ketchup and a big pinch of both salt and pepper and cook for 2 min or until warmed through


Remove from the heat and stir in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span>&nbsp;water - the mince mixture should be quite wet

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/517.step6-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Wash then add&nbsp;1/4 of the baby&nbsp;spinach&nbsp;(you'll use the rest later) over the bottom of your oven-proof dish, add 1/3 of the mince mixture&nbsp;and layer 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>&nbsp;lasagne verdi sheets over


Repeat until all of the lasagne verdi sheets and mince mixture have been used - make sure you cover the sheets completely so that they cook properly

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/517.step7-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Pour the b&eacute;chamel sauce&nbsp;over the last&nbsp;lasagne verdi sheets and sprinkle with dried oregano


Put the dish in the oven for 20-30 min or until the lasagne&nbsp;is cooked through


Remove and allow to cool before serving (it will be extremely hot!)

### Step 8

Just before serving, dress the remaining baby&nbsp;spinach&nbsp;with&nbsp;white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper


Serve the lasagne with the dressed salad to the side


Enjoy!
