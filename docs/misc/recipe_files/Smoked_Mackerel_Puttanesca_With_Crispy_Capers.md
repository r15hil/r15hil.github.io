### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your capers and cook for 5-6 min, stirring frequently, or until crisp

Once crisp, transfer them to a plate, reserving the pan and any remaining oil – these are your crispy capers

### Step 2

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

### Step 4

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until it's cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste and cook for 1 min

Add your chopped tomatoes and a grind of pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until a thick pasta sauce remains

### Step 7

Chop your black olives in half

Add the torn smoked mackerel, halved olives and the drained linguine to the pan

Add a few splashes of starchy pasta water and mix well until all of the linguine is coated in the sauce – this is your smoked mackerel puttanesca

### Step 8

Serve the smoked mackerel puttanesca topped with the crispy capers and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
