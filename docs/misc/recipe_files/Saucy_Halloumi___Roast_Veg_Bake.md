## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 230ºC/ 210ºC (fan)/ gas 8

Boil half a kettle

Trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and discard, then chop lengthways into wedges

Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges


### Step 2

Add the chopped aubergine and onion to a baking tray with the dried oregano, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a small pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12-15 min

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Once the aubergine and onion have had 12-15 min, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and return to the oven for a further 5 min


### Step 4

Whilst everything is cooking, dissolve the tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water

Add the balsamic vinegar and stir it all together – this is your tomato stock

Slice the halloumi into 3 slices per person


### Step 5

Add the tomato stock to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top the veg with the halloumi slices and return to the oven for a final 10-15 min or until the stock has thickened slightly and the halloumi is golden - this is your saucy halloumi & roast veg bake

Tip: To help the sauce thicken, give it a stir half way through


### Step 6

When the halloumi is almost golden, add the ciabatta[s] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Carefully slice the warmed ciabattas in half before serving


### Step 7

Chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the saucy halloumi & roast veg bake with the ciabatta halves to the side

Garnish with the chopped basil

Enjoy!
