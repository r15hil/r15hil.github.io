## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drain the jackfruit and tear (or chop!) into small, bite-sized pieces


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened


### Step 3

While the onions are cooking, dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>Knorr vegetable stock cube and the tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock


### Step 4

Once the onion has softened, add the torn jackfruit, ground cumin, smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 4-5 min or until browned

Meanwhile, tear (or crumble!) the vegan cheese into small pieces


### Step 5

Increase the heat to high, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your smoky jackfruit filling

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little olive oil


### Step 6

Once thickened, divide the smoky jackfruit filling between the tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and arrange them into the oven-proof dish

Top with the torn vegan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until the tortillas are beginning to crisp and the cheese has melted – these are your smoky jackfruit enchiladas


### Step 7

While the enchiladas are cooking, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Trim, then slice the spring onions finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped tomatoes, spring onion and coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together – this is your tomato salsa

### Step 8

Serve the smoky jackfruit enchiladas topped with the tomato salsa

Enjoy!
