## Ingredients

- 160g fine green beans
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 16g tomato paste
- 0 fine green beans
- 0 jumbo king prawns
- 0 white basmati rice
- 1 20g mango chutney
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 4 rotis
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 212g jumbo king prawns
- 100g basmati rice
- 1 green chilli
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 15g tamarind paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 3 spring onions

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span>[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onions

Slice your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Boil a kettle


### Step 3

Top half your rotis with the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated cheese, 2/3 of the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a grind of black pepper

Place the remaining rotis on top so you end up with 1 roti sandwich per person, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-7 minutes or until the cheese has melted

Once done, top the roti[s] with a small knob of butter – this is your chilli cheese roti


### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain your jumbo prawns

Once hot, add the drained prawns and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown


### Step 5

While the prawns are cooking, trim your green beans

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the trimmed green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until tender and slightly charred – these are your charred green beans


### Step 6

Dissolve your creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your tamarind paste and mango chutney – this is your coconut stock


### Step 7

Once the prawns are starting to brown, add the remaining sliced spring onion, ginger & garlic paste, tomato paste, curry powder and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly reduced and the prawns are cooked through – this is your Goan-style Jumbo prawn & coconut curry

### Step 8

Cut the chilli cheese roti into quarters

Serve the Goan-style Jumbo prawn & coconut curry next to the basmati rice with the charred green beans and chilli cheese roti quarters to the side

Enjoy!
