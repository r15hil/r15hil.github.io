## Ingredients

- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 400g canned finely chopped tomatoes
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 50g rocket
- 10g basil
- 125g mozzarella
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the panko breadcrumbs and cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently

Once golden, transfer to a bowl and reserve the pan – these are your crispy breadcrumbs


### Step 2

Trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and slice into rounds

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a very generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the aubergine rounds and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop half the basil finely, including the stalks (reserve the rest for later!)


### Step 4

Return the reserved aubergine pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 5-6 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until fragrant and beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, add the chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix, bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>, half the chopped basil (save the rest for later!) and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce


### Step 5

Add the cooked aubergine to the tomato sauce

Season with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has thickened


### Step 6

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Return the reserved breadcrumb pan to a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, add the remaining chopped garlic, remaining chopped basil and toasted ciabattas cut-side down and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant and charred – this is your garlic bread


### Step 7

Once thickened, remove the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves] </span>from the tomato sauce and top with the torn mozzarella and reserved basil leaves

Cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your stove-top aubergine parmigiana

Wash the rocket then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the grated Italian hard cheese with the crispy breadcrumbs – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

### Step 8

Serve the stove-top aubergine parmigiana with the garlic bread and rocket to the side

Sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumbs over the stove-top aubergine parmigiana

Drizzle the rocket with the balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil

Enjoy!
