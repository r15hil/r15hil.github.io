- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Waxy potatoes (350g)
- Onion marmalade (20g)
- Taste & glory vegan sausages (6pcs)
- Henderson's Relish (15ml)
- Wholegrain mustard (21g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the meat-free sausages to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until they are browned


### Step 2

While the sausages are in the oven, peel and finely slice the red onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt

Cook for 5 min, or until the onion has softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut the waxy potatoes into quarters

Add them to a pot, cover with plenty of cold water and a pinch of salt

Bring to a boil over a high heat and cook for 20 min or until fork-tender


### Step 4

Once the onion is soft, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, the onion marmalade, red wine vinegar, Henderson's Relish and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water

Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cook the onions for a further 20 min, or until they're sticky and sweet – these are your caramelised onions


### Step 5

While the onions are cooking, combine the mayo, wholegrain mustard and white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing


### Step 6

Wash the salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


### Step 7

Once cooked, drain the potatoes and add to a bowl with the salad, sliced spring onions and dressing, then mix gently – this is your warm potato salad

### Step 8

Serve the cooked meat-free sausages with the caramelised onions and warm potato salad to the side

Enjoy!
