### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and boil a kettle

Once the pan is hot, add your roasted garlic paste, blanched peas and smoked basa fillet[s] with a generous pinch of pepper and cook, covered, for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 3

Whilst your fish is cooking, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and keep to one side, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

### Step 4

Drizzle some olive oil through the drained spaghetti and give it a good mix up (this stops the pasta from sticking together!)

### Step 5

Serve the smoked basa & creamy lemon spaghetti

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper
