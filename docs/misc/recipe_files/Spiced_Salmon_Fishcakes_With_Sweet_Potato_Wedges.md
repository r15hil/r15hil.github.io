### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp

### Step 2

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to a heatproof bowl

Cover with cling film, pierce a few holes in the top with a fork and put the bowl in the microwave for 8-9 min or until fork tender

Once cooked, carefully remove the cling film and leave the potatoes to cool for 2-3 min then mash together

### Step 3

While the sweet potatoes are cooking, zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut 1 wedge per person from the zested lime[s] and set aside for later

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

### Step 4

Add your salmon flakes and sliced spring onion to the bowl with the mashed potato

Add the lime zest, egg[s], mango chutney, your ground allspice, your cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> flour and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your fishcake mixture

### Step 5

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Divide the fishcake mixture into 2 per person and shape them into fishcakes, then press into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your spiced fishcakes

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, gently add the spiced fishcakes and cook for 4-5 min on each side, turning carefully halfway, or until golden brown

### Step 7

Combine your mayo with a squeeze of juice from the remaining zested lime in a bowl – this is your lime mayo

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

### Step 8

Serve the spiced fishcakes with the paprika sweet potato fries, lime mayo and salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and garnish with a reserved lime wedge

Enjoy!
