## Instructions


### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut very finely

Dissolve half the chopped creamed coconut (you'll use the rest later!) in 20ml <span class="text-purple">[30ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[40ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof bowl

Add half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and set aside to cool slightly – this is your coconut marinade


### Step 2

Add your basmati rice, the remaining chopped creamed coconut and a pinch of salt with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, give it one stir and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your coconut rice


### Step 3

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 8-9 min for boiled egg[s]

Once done, drain and refill the pot with ice-cold water and the cooked egg[s], then set aside to cool

Tip: Use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your chicken thighs and your curry powder in a large bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the coconut marinade (reserve the bowl!) and give it a good mix up

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and, using your hands, scrunch the flour onto the chicken until fully coated – this is your coated chicken


### Step 5

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken, skin-side down, to the pan and cook for 10 min, then reduce the heat to medium-high, flip chicken over and cook for 8 min or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, season the cooked chicken with a pinch of salt – this is your Malaysian-style fried chicken

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!


### Step 6

While the chicken is cooking, slice your cucumber into discs on the diagonal

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine your sambal and the juice of half your lime[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) in the reserved bowl with the remaining soy sauce, a little drizzle of vegetable oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your sambal dipping sauce

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person


### Step 7

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut in half

### Step 8

Serve the Malaysian-style fried chicken with the sliced cucumber, sambal dipping sauce and egg to the side

Serve with the coconut rice and top with your crispy onions

Garnish with a lime wedge

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!
