Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add them to a large oven-proof dish (or two!)

Crush your garlic by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Return the dish[es] to the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baked lemon & herb chicken with cherry tomatoes
