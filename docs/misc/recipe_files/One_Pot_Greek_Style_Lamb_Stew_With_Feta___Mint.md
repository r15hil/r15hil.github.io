## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


### Step 3

Once hot, add your lamb mince to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until very lightly browned all over, breaking it up into rough, large chunks


### Step 4

Chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato and aubergine to the dish and stir everything together


### Step 5

Add your balsamic vinegar to the dish with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, your beef stock mix, tomato paste and dried basil

Add 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season generously with salt and pepper


### Step 6

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 40-45 min or until the potatoes are tender and everything's cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one-pot Greek-style lamb stew

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 7

Once everything's almost done, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the mint stems firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Crumble your feta into a bowl with the chopped mint and mix together – this is your feta & mint topping

### Step 8

To serve, remove the one-pot Greek-style lamb stew from the oven and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Sprinkle the mint & feta topping all over the one-pot Greek-style lamb stew

Dig in!
