## Ingredients

- Living lettuce
- Mustard ketchup (20g)
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Tomato ketchup (10ml) x0
- Ciabatta x2
- Proper Porker sausages (4pcs)
- White potato x3
- Carrot
- Tomato ketchup (30ml)
- White wine vinegar (15ml)
- Apple
- Honey (25g)
- Brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes into chips and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp


### Step 2

While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil on a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of sugar and cook for 15 min, stirring occasionally, or until golden and caramelised

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for serving


### Step 3

Add your sausages to a separate baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, combine your honey with your mustard ketchup in a bowl – this is your honey mustard sauce

Slice your apple[s] into matchsticks and discard the core[s]

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(no need to peel!)


### Step 5

Add the apple matchsticks and grated carrot to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and mayo

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your apple & carrot slaw

Remove the base of your lettuce, then wash under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper 

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves


### Step 6

Once the sausages have had 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and drizzle the honey mustard sauce all over them

Return the tray to the oven for 10 min further or until the sausages are cooked through and the sauce is sticky – these are your sticky honey mustard sausages

Tip: Turn the sausages a couple of times in the sauce to get them nicely coated!


### Step 7

Once everything's almost cooked, cut your ciabatta[s] in half down the middle

Cut a slit into each ciabatta half being careful not to cut all the way through (this is where your sausages will sit) – these are your mini ciabatta buns

Add the mini ciabatta buns to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

### Step 8

Fill each mini ciabatta bun with a sticky honey mustard sausage, some of your tomato ketchup and the caramelised onions

Serve the sticky honey mustard posh dogs with the chips, apple & carrot slaw and torn lettuce to the side

Enjoy!
