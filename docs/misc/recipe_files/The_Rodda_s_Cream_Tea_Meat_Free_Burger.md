## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into thin discs


### Step 2

Add the potato discs to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Spread the potato discs into a single layer and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your salt & pepper slices

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!


### Step 3

Meanwhile, cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>slices from the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and set these aside for later

Chop the remaining tomato finely


### Step 4

Heat a pot  with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to break down

Once the tomato has started to break down, add the tomato paste, red wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your warming tomato jam


### Step 5

Once the jam is done, transfer it to a bowl and leave to cool slightly

Tip: The jam will thicken whilst it cools!

Wash, then separate the lettuce leaves and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Slice the brioche buns in half


### Step 6

Add the meat-free burger patties to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 8 min


### Step 7

After 8 min, add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return the tray to the oven for 2-4 min or until the bread is lightly toasted and the burgers are cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

### Step 8

Build your burger by topping the toasted brioche base with the lettuce leaves, sliced tomato and a meat-free burger patty

Spoon over the warming tomato jam and the clotted cream (in whichever order you like!) and then top with the toasted brioche lid

Serve with the salt & pepper slices to the side

Enjoy!
