## Ingredients

- Smoked basa fillet x0
- Canned sweetcorn (150g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Garlic clove
- Smoked basa fillets (2pcs)
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Leek
- White potato x3

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Wash your leek[s] thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened


### Step 3

Whilst the leek is softening, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 550ml <span class="text-purple">[720ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[940ml]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk – this is your creamy vegetable stock

Drain your sweetcorn

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Once the leek has softened, add the chopped garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant


### Step 5

Once fragrant, add the chopped potatoes and creamy vegetable stock and cook for 15-18 min or until the potatoes are almost fork-tender


### Step 6

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your smoked basa into bite-sized pieces


### Step 7

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add the chopped smoked basa, soft cheese and drained sweetcorn to the pan and gently stir it all together

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until the smoked basa is cooked through and the potatoes are fork-tender – this is your one-pot smoked basa, leek & sweetcorn chowder

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the one-pot smoked basa, leek & sweetcorn chowder and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
