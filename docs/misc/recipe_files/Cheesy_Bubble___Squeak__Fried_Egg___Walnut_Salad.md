### Step 1

Boil a kettle, then peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Wash your leek[s] carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the chopped garlic, dried thyme, sliced leek and half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min

Meanwhile, rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

### Step 4

Add the sliced greens to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further

Add the drained potatoes with a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and mash everything together, then flatten the mixture out in the pan

Increase the heat to high and cook for 3-4 min or until the bottom is starting to crisp

### Step 5

Preheat the grill to medium

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your cider vinegar, Dijon mustard and 1/2 tbsp [3/4 tbsp] [1 tbsp] olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your mustard dressing

Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

### Step 6

Give the potato & vegetable mixture a good mix up to stir through the crispy base

Roughly re-flatten the mixture in the pan and sprinkle over the grated cheese and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Put the pan under the grill for 4-5 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy bubble & squeak

Tip: Make sure you leave the pan handle outside of the oven and the door open whilst grilling!

### Step 7

Meanwhile, heat a separate medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Combine the salad, walnuts, remaining onion and mustard dressing in a bowl and gently mix together - this is your walnut salad

### Step 8

Cut the cheesy bubble & squeak in half and serve the fried egg over the top with the walnut salad to the side

Enjoy!
