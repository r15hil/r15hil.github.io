### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash is fork-tender

### Step 5

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the butternut squash cubes to the pan with the ground coriander and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your coriander squash

### Step 7

Meanwhile, combine the natural yoghurt, most of the chopped mint leaves (save some for garnish!), the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl

Give everything a stir – this is your mint yoghurt

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork

### Step 8

Serve the coriander squash over the couscous with the cucumber batons to the side

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt

Garnish with the flaked almonds, reserved chopped mint leaves, a lemon wedge and a grind of pepper

Enjoy!
