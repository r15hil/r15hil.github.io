## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat your basa fillet[s] in the flour, tap off the excess, then add into the beaten egg and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over


### Step 3

Heat a pot over a low heat

Add your tomato ketchup, soy sauce and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until thick and sticky, then remove from the heat and set aside for serving – this is your amai sauce


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]


### Step 5

Cut your apple[s] (skin on) into matchsticks and discard the core[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded basa (cooking for 4 or more? Do this in batches!) and cook for 4-5 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your basa katsu

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 7

Combine the grated ginger, grated carrot, apple matchsticks, sliced spring onion and your mayo in a large bowl – this is your zingy apple slaw

### Step 8

Slice the basa katsu into strips

Serve the sliced basa katsu with the cooked rice and zingy apple slaw to the side

Drizzle over the amai sauce

Enjoy!
