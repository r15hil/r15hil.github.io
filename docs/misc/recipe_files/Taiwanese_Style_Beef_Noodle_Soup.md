## Ingredients

- 250g British beef strips
- 1 tomato
- 1 rice vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 2.5g cracked black pepper
- 1 star anise
- 1 fine egg noodle nest
- 1 Knorr beef stock cube
- 150g spring greens
- 1/2 tsp five-spice mix
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Once very hot, add the beef strips with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 or until browned all over

Transfer the cooked beef strips to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 2

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-7 min or until softened and caramelised


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips


### Step 4

Add the fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain and set aside


### Step 5

Re-boil a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped tomato and garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add half<span class="text-danger"> [all]</span> of the five-spice with the cracked black pepper and star anise and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant


### Step 6

Dissolve the Knorr beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


### Step 7

Add the beef stock to the pan with the rice vinegar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the sliced spring greens and any resting juices from the beef strips

Stir it all together and cook for 2 min further or until the spring greens are bright green and wilted â€“ this is your fragrant broth

### Step 8

Arrange the drained noodles, wilted spring greens and beef strips in bowls

Pour the fragrant broth all over

Enjoy!
