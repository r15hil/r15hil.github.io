## Description

Flavoured with miso paste – a traditional Japanese seasoning made from soy beans – these chicken noodles are fabulously satisfying and delicious. You’ll char red pepper strips in a dry pan for a smoky edge and add coriander to freshen and balance the dish beautifully. (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).

### Step 2

Combine the miso paste with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water, the soy sauce and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your miso mixture

### Step 3

Add the wholewheat noodles to a pot of boiled water (enough to fully submerge them)


Bring to the boil and cook over a high heat for 4-7 min until the noodles are cooked with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

### Step 4

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the sliced red pepper and cook for 3-5 min until starting to blacken slightly and char (this adds a smoky flavour)

### Step 5

Meanwhile, slice the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into equally sized strips


Once the peppers are charred, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat

### Step 6

Add the sliced chicken to the pan with a large drizzle of vegetable oil


Cook for 2 min, or until the chicken starts to turn golden, then add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chilli flakes (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


Cook for a further 2 min, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

### Step 7

Add the charred pepper back to the pan with the miso mixture and cook for 30 sec


Add the cooked, drained noodles and toss to coat them thoroughly


Remove from the heat and stir in the toasted sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and most of the chopped coriander (reserve some for garnish) – these are your miso &amp; sesame chicken noodles

### Step 8

Serve the miso &amp; sesame chicken noodles and garnish with the remaining coriander 


Enjoy!
