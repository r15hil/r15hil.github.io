This bright tasting Thai classic is packed with fresh flavours of mint, chilli, coriander & lime. Normally served with noodles, we're using quinoa instead and adding charred pineapple.

## Instructions


### Step 1

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender


Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, quarter the pineapple slices (reserve the juice!)&nbsp;


Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium heat&nbsp;


Once hot, add the pineapple and cook for 2-4 min or until starting to brown


### Step 3

Once browned, push the pineapple&nbsp;to the side of the pan and add the pork mince with a pinch of salt&nbsp;


Cook the pork for 5-6 min, breaking it up with a spatula as you go&nbsp;


### Step 4

Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Slice the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### Step 5

Once cooked, add the chopped ginger, garlic and chilli jam to the pan and cook for 1 min&nbsp;


Add the soy sauce, fish sauce and the reserved pineapple juice to the pan and cook for 1 min further


Remove the pan from the heat and set aside &ndash; this is your pork larb


&nbsp;


### Step 6

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Pick the mint leaves, discarding the stems&nbsp;


Chop the mint leaves and coriander roughly


Squeeze the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime into the pan and add the chopped mint, coriander, shallot and cooked quinoa and give everything a good old mix up&nbsp;


### Step 7

Separate the little&nbsp;gem lettuce leaves


Chop the&nbsp;roasted&nbsp;peanuts&nbsp;roughly


&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the pork larb with the gem lettuce to the side (use these for scooping!)&nbsp;

Enjoy!
