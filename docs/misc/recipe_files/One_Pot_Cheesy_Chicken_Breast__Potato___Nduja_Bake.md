## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a medium-high heat

Add your 'Nduja to the dish, breaking it into small chunks and cook for 1 min or until it begins to release its oil


### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel your red onion[s] and chop into wedges

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small, rough pieces

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges


### Step 4

Add your diced chicken breast to the dish with the chopped potatoes, red onion wedges, tomato wedges, chopped tomatoes, chicken stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good stir and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 5

Once boiling, cover the dish with a lid and put it in the oven for 35-40 min or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!


### Step 6

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and your balsamic vinegar and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressed salad


### Step 7

After 35-40 min, remove the dish from the oven and taste for seasoning, adding a pinch of salt and pepper if needed

Sprinkle the grated cheese over the bake, then return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for 5 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy chicken breast, potato & 'Nduja bake

### Step 8

Season the cheesy chicken breast, potato & 'Nduja bake with a good grind of black pepper

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Dig in!
