## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Drain your sweetcorn

Once hot, add your baby plum tomatoes and drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes are starting to soften


### Step 3

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your spinach, pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 4

Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the cooked gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water


### Step 5

Once the tomatoes have softened, add your smoked paprika, roasted garlic paste and spinach to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach is starting to wilt


### Step 6

Once the spinach has wilted, add your soft cheese with your vegetable stock mix and a splash of starchy pasta water to the pan

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up


### Step 7

Add the drained gnocchi and half the grated cheddar (save the rest for garnish!) and mix it all together – this is your cheesy tomato & sweetcorn gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy cooking water if it's looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the cheesy tomato & sweetcorn gnocchi

Garnish with the remaining grated cheddar and the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
