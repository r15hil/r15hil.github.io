## Ingredients

- Ground coriander (1tsp)
- Ground cumin (1tsp)
- Basa fillets (2pcs)
- Cheddar cheese (40g)
- Spring onion x2
- Chipotle paste (20g)
- Basa fillet x0
- Tomato paste (16g)

- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Lime
- Gem lettuce

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil half a kettle

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste in a bowl – this is your spiced tomato paste


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced tomato paste to the pan with 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water and season with a generous pinch of salt

Cover with a lid and cook for an initial 7-10 min or until the sauce has reduced slightly


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Sprinkle your ground cumin, ground coriander and a large pinch of salt over the chopped basa and gently rub the spices all over the fish


### Step 4

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred 

Grate your cheddar cheese


### Step 5

Once the sauce has reduced, add the chopped basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your chipotle spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 6

Whilst the basa is cooking, combine your mayo with a squeeze of lime juice and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a bowl – this is your lime mayo


### Step 7

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Slice the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Divide the shredded lettuce, sliced spring onion, chipotle spiced basa, grated cheese and lime mayo evenly between the warmed tortillas

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
