## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water, then add your quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving


### Step 2

Meanwhile, slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Chop the root[s] off your lettuce and separate the leaves, then wash and pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 3

Add the cucumber matchsticks and grated carrot to a bowl

Add your rice vinegar with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled carrot & cucumber

Set aside for later


### Step 4

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely


### Step 5

Combine the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and juice of your lime[s] with your soy sauce, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir it all together – this is your lime dressing


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Drain your king prawns

Once hot, add the drained king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through


### Step 7

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 8

Serve the cooked king prawns with the quinoa, quick-pickled carrot & cucumber and lettuce leaves to the side

Drizzle the lime dressing all over

Garnish with your roasted peanuts and chopped herbs

Enjoy!
