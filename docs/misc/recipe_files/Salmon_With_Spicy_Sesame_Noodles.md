## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

While the fish is cooking, heat a pot of boiled water over a high heat

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Tip: Chop them in one bunch for speed!


### Step 4

Once the water is boiling, add the halved Tenderstem broccoli and halved green beans and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add your fine egg noodles and cook for 2 min or until both the noodles and veg are cooked through


### Step 5

Squeeze the juice of half your lime[s] into a bowl, and cut the remaining lime into wedges

Add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, sriracha and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy sesame dressing


### Step 6

Once cooked, drain the veg & noodles, then drizzle over some vegetable oil and return them to the pot

Tip: This stops the noodles from sticking together


### Step 7

Stir most of the spicy sesame dressing (save some for garnish!) through the drained veg & noodles – these are your spicy sesame noodles

Tip: Add another small drizzle of vegetable oil if it is looking a little dry

### Step 8

Serve the cooked salmon over the spicy sesame noodles

Drizzle the salmon with the remaining spicy sesame dressing and sprinkle over your black sesame seeds

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
