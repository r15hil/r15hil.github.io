### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then peel and finely dice half of your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and chop most of your parsley finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Combine your lean pork mince with your panko breadcrumbs, diced red onion, ground cumin, half your ground smoked paprika, half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Divide the mix into 3 per person and shape into meatballs

Cut the remaining red onion into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons

### Step 7

Once softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until almost all of the liquid is absorbed

Add the chicken stock and cook for 3-4 min further or until reduced slightly

Once reduced, stir in your soft cheese, remaining chopped parsley and a good grind of black pepper then remove from the heat – this is your creamy mushroom sauce

### Step 8

Serve the cooked lean pork meatballs over the roasted vegetables and pour the creamy mushroom sauce all over – this is your creamy lean pork meatball & mushroom traybake
