### Step 1

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until browned

Once browned, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add your orzo and cook for 1 min further

### Step 3

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml<span class="text-purple"> [750ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for an initial 5 min

### Step 4

### Step 5

Heat a small dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine kernels and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

### Step 6

Once the orzo has been cooking for 5 min, add the halved green beans and cook, covered, for a further 10 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash more water if your orzo is looking a little dry, and stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking!

### Step 7

Once done, add a large knob of butter, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a very generous grind of black pepper

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until wilted

Add half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken breast orzo primavera

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Serve the chicken breast orzo primavera topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, the toasted pine kernels and a grind of black pepper

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
