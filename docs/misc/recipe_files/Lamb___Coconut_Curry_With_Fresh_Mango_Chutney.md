## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your panko breadcrumbs and lamb mince to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper, mix until combined, then divide and roll into 3 meatballs per person (use clean hands!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned


### Step 2

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once done, transfer the browned meatballs to a plate and reserve the pan


### Step 3

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving


### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 3/4 of the chopped onion (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 350ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [475ml] [600ml]</span> </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock


### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, curry powder and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs

Add the coconut stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2 min

Add the browned meatballs, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)


### Step 6

Whilst the curry is cooking, top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone[s]


### Step 7

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the diced mango with the remaining chopped onion, half the chopped coriander (you’ll use the rest later!), remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your fresh mango chutney

Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the curry – this is your lamb & coconut curry

### Step 8

Serve the lamb & coconut curry over the basmati rice

Top with the fresh mango chutney

Enjoy!
