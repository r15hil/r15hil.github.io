## Ingredients

- Gem lettuce
- British pork mince (125g) x0
- Mayonnaise (30ml)
- Gluten free brioche buns (2pcs)
- Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- British pork mince (250g)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Apple
- Spring onion
- Red onion x2

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then season with half of your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until crisp – these are your paprika wedges


### Step 2

While the potato wedges are cooking, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with the remaining ground smoked paprika and half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for later!) in a bowl and season very generously with salt and pepper

Divide and shape into patties for 1 per person and refrigerate (this helps them hold their shape whilst cooking) – these are your paprika pork patty[ies]


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Slice your gluten free brioche buns in half

Once the pan is hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted, then set aside until serving and reserve the pan


### Step 4

Peel your red onions, then slice into thin rings

Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the red onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onions have started to caramelise

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings


### Step 5

Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar, mayo, remaining sliced spring onion, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your salad dressing

Slice your apple[s] (skin on) thinly, discard the core[s] then add to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple


### Step 6

Return the reserved pan to a high heat and remove the paprika pork patties from the fridge

Once hot, add the paprika pork patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip each paprika pork patty and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)


### Step 7

Wash and shred your lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and mix it all together – this is your apple salad

### Step 8

To assemble, sandwich the paprika pork patty[ies], caramelised onion rings and some apple salad between the toasted brioche halves – these are your paprika pork burgers

Serve the paprika wedges and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!
