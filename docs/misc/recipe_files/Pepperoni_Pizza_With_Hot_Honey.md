- Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)
- Tomato paste (16g) x0
- Mozzarella (125g)
- Garlic clove
- Tomato paste (32g)
- Baby leaf salad (50g)
- Balsamic vinegar (15ml)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your honey and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl and stir it all together – this is your hot honey


### Step 2

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces


### Step 4

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic, dried oregano and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base


### Step 5

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato base evenly over your pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with your pepperoni, pepper strips and torn mozzarella

### Step 6

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your pepperoni pizza


### Step 7

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the dressing and toss – this is your balsamic salad

### Step 8

Serve the pepperoni pizza with the hot honey drizzled all over (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve with the balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!
