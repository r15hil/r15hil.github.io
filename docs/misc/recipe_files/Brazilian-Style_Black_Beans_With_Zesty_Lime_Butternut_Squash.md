### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

### Step 2

While the rice is cooking, add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and golden

### Step 3

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

### Step 4

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

### Step 5

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and ground cumin to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Drain and rinse your black beans

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and chipotle stock and cook, covered for 5-7 min or until the beans are soft enough to mash

### Step 6

While the black beans are cooking, chop your parsley including the stalks

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Once the beans are done, add a generous knob of butter and mash until smooth – these are your Brazilian-style black beans

### Step 7

Once the butternut squash is tender, add it to a bowl with your mango chutney, sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Zest and juice half your lime[s] into the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty lime butternut squash

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

### Step 8

Serve the Brazilian-style black beans over the brown rice and top with the zesty lime butternut squash

Garnish with the chopped parsley and a lime wedge

Enjoy!
