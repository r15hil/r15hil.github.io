Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

### Step 3

While the pepper strips are cooking, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 5

Drain your king prawns

### Step 6

Add the sliced garlic, chopped tomato and a small splash of water and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomato is starting to soften and the prawns are cooked through

### Step 7

Once the tomato is soft, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) crème fraîche, drained spaghetti, most of the chopped coriander, half your ground sumac (you'll use the rest later!) and a splash of starchy pasta water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy harissa, charred pepper & king prawn spaghetti

Tip: If it's looking a little dry add a splash more of the starchy pasta water

### Step 8

Serve the creamy harissa, charred pepper & king prawn spaghetti

Top with the remaining ground sumac, remaining chopped coriander and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
