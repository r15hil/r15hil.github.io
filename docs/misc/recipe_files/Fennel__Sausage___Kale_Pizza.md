### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!), breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go, then add the chopped garlic and fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Go easy!)

Cook for 3 min or until the sausage meat has slightly browned

### Step 3

Once the sausage meat has browned, push to one side of the pan and add the sliced onion to the other side with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min until softened

Add your balsamic vinegar and a pinch of sugar to the softened onions and cook for 2 min further or until the onions are caramelised and the sausage meat is brown and crispy (no pink meat!)

### Step 4

Meanwhile, add your tomato paste to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

### Step 5

Wash your shredded kale, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the sausage meat has browned, add the shredded kale to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until the kale is starting to wilt – this is your kale & sausage mix

### Step 6

Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato sauce evenly all over on the pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella and kale & sausage mix

### Step 7

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the mozzarella has melted and the pizza base is crisp – this is your fennel, sausage & kale pizza

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!

### Step 8

Serve the fennel, sausage & kale pizza with a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!
