- Orzo (75g) x0
- Pine nuts (15g)
- Vegetable stock mix (5.5g)
- Basil (10g)
- Basil (5g) x0
- Garlic clove
- Orzo (150g)
- Baby plum tomatoes (125g)
- Aubergine
- Rocket (50g)

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Add your pine nuts to a baking tray, then put the tray in the oven and cook for 3-5 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, transfer to a plate to cool (save the tray for later!)


### Step 2

While the pine nuts are toasting, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s], then slice in half widthways and cut into wedges

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges


### Step 3

Add the aubergine wedges, red onion wedges and baby plum tomatoes to the reserved baking tray (cooking for 4 or more? You may need 2 trays!)

Drizzle generously with olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – this is your roasted aubergine & tomato


### Step 4

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 5

Add your orzo to an oven-proof dish

Add the chopped tomatoes, chopped garlic and vegetable stock to the dish and gently stir it all together


### Step 6

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until the liquid has been absorbed and the orzo is cooked – this is your oven-baked orzo

Meanwhile, wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

Add most of the toasted pine nuts, chopped basil and rocket (save some of each for garnish!) to a food processor

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your rocket pesto

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, use a pestle & mortar!

### Step 8

Top the oven-baked orzo with the roasted aubergine & tomato – this is your roasted aubergine & tomato orzo

Serve the roasted aubergine & tomato orzo with the rocket pesto drizzled all over

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil, toasted pine nuts and rocket

Enjoy!
