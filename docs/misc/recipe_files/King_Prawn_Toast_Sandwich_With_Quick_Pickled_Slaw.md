### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

### Step 2

Whilst the fries are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

### Step 3

Drain, then chop your king prawns until they are very finely minced (keep chopping until they become sticky!)

Combine the minced prawns in a bowl with the chopped garlic, half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and your soy sauce – this is your king prawn toast mix

### Step 4

Combine most of your mayo (you'll use the rest later!) and your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a separate bowl with your rice vinegar, remaining chopped coriander and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled slaw

### Step 5

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half

Spread the king prawn toast mix onto each ciabatta base (save the lid for later!) – this is your king prawn ciabatta

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the king prawn ciabatta, prawn-side down and cook for 5 min, then flip and cook for a further 2 min on the other side, or until the prawns are cooked through and the toast is golden – this is your king prawn toast[s]

Once done, transfer the king prawn toast[s] to kitchen paper to drain

### Step 7

Meanwhile, spread the remaining mayo over the top of your ciabatta lid[s] and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Add the ciabatta lid[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 or until the ciabatta is starting to brown – this is your sesame ciabatta lid

### Step 8

Top the king prawn toast with a dollop of sriracha mayo, some quick-pickled slaw and the sesame ciabatta lid – this is your king prawn toast sandwich

Serve the king prawn toast sandwich with the fries and any remaining quick-pickled slaw to the side

Enjoy!
