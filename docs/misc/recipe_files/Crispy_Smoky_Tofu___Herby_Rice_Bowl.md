## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into strips

Add the tofu strips to a bowl with the tamari soy sauce


### Step 3

Add your cornflour and ground smoked paprika to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Coat the tofu strips in the cornflour mix – this is your coated tofu

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 6 min or until crispy all over, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper – this is your crispy smoky tofu


### Step 4

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly


### Step 5

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks

Combine the chopped coriander and chopped mint, then finely chop them together


### Step 6

Add the grated carrot, sliced cucumber and cider vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled carrot & cucumber salad

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper


### Step 7

Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo in a bowl with a splash of water – this is your harissa dressing

Combine the cooked brown rice with the chopped coriander & mint and season with a pinch of salt – this is your herby rice

### Step 8

Serve the herby rice with the salad, crispy smoky tofu and the quick-pickled carrot & cucumber salad to the side

Drizzle over the harissa dressing

Enjoy!
