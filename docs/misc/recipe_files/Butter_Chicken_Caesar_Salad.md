## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add your curry powder, ground cumin and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your butter curry paste


### Step 2

Once fragrant, add half the butter curry paste to a small bowl and set aside for later

Add the remaining butter curry paste to a large bowl with the chicken breast portions, a very generous pinch of salt and a splash of cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated butter chicken


### Step 3

Transfer the marinated butter chicken to one side of a baking paper-lined tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12 min


### Step 4

Meanwhile, tear your garlic & coriander naan[s] into bite-sized pieces

Once the chicken has had an initial 12 min, add the naan pieces to the other side of the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray to the oven for 7-8 min further or until the croutons are crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your butter chicken and naan croutons


### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Remove the outer lettuce leaves and shred the inner core

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic


### Step 6

Add your mayo, grated garlic and most of the grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) to the bowl with the remaining butter curry paste

Add your white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced Caesar dressing


### Step 7

Once everything's done, add the lettuce leaves and shredded core to a large bowl

Add the spiced Caesar dressing and give everything a gentle mix up so it is evenly coated in the dressing – this is your spiced Caesar salad

Slice the butter chicken finely

### Step 8

Serve the sliced butter chicken and naan croutons on top of the spiced Caesar salad

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!
