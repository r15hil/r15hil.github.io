## Description

The twist to this classic, clean dish is in the vinaigrette; made by soaking chopped shallots in vinegar, which mellows their flavour, then combining them with butter which is melted and browned into a naturally nutty tasting sauce. Served with greens and potatoes, tumbled together with fresh parsley and toasted hazelnuts. We're nuts for it...

## Ingredients

- 400g waxy potatoes
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 
- 80g green vegetable medley
- 1 bag of hazelnuts
- 10g parsley 
- 1/2 shallot
- 2 cod fillets

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Cut the waxy potatoes (skins on) into thick discs


Add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 15 min or until they're fork-tender


### Step 2

Meanwhile, peel and dice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> shallot finely and add it to a small bowl with a small pinch of both salt and sugar


Add the white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle


### Step 3

Add the hazelnuts to a small baking tray or heatproof dish


Put them in the oven for 5 min or until they have darkened in colour and started to crack slightly


### Step 4

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


### Step 5

Once the potatoes have been cooking for 15 min, add the green vegetable medley to the pot


Cook the potatoes and green vegetables together for a further 4 min, then drain everything and return to the pot, allowing them to steam dry for a few min


Once done, leave the toasted hazelnuts to cool slightly then chop them roughly


### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan over a high heat


Pat the cod fillets dry, rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with a little salt


Once hot, add the cod to the pan and cook for 4 min, carefully flipping once halfway through (your fish is cooked once it flakes easily), then transfer to a plate and keep the pan for the next step


### Step 7

Return the pan to a medium heat and add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> butter 


Once the butter has melted, foamed and started to brown, pour it into the pickled shallot – this is your brown butter vinaigrette 


Add the chopped parsley and chopped hazelnuts to the potatoes and green vegetables with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and mix them through

### Step 8

Serve the cod over the vegetables and spoon the brown butter vinaigrette over


Tip: keep the vinaigrette to the side, adding more to taste if needed


Season with pepper


Enjoy!
