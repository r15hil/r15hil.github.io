## Instructions


### Step 1

Turn on your slow cooker to high

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferable non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Peel and chop half your red onion[s] into wedges (save the rest for later!)

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and the onion wedges and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly charred


### Step 2

Boil a kettle

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 3

Once the mushrooms and onion are slightly charred, transfer the contents of your pan to the slow cooker

Add half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with half the chopped garlic and half the chopped tomato (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your tomato paste and ground smoked paprika with your ground coriander, dried oregano, vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water


### Step 4

Give everything a good mix up, season with a generous pinch of salt and cook on high for 4 hours

Once the seasoned mushrooms are ready, give everything a good mix up and shred the pulled mushrooms apart, using two forks – this is your spiced Fable mushroom mix


### Step 5

While the mushrooms are cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Peel and finely dice the remaining onion

Cut your lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half the lime[s] with your mayo – this is your lime mayo


### Step 6

Combine the drained sweetcorn with the remaining chopped garlic and the remaining chopped tomato in a medium bowl

Add the diced onion and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with the juice of 1/4 of your lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Add a drizzle of olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and refrigerate until serving – this is your corn salsa


### Step 7

Once the spiced Fable mushroom mix is ready, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

### Step 8

Load up the warmed tortillas with the spiced Fable mushroom mix and the corn salsa – these are your Fable mushroom carnitas-style tacos

Drizzle over the lime mayo and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!
