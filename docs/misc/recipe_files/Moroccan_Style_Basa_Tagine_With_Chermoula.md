### Step 2

Add half the chopped garlic to a food processor with the chopped coriander & parsley

Add half your ground cumin (you’ll use the rest later), the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and blitz well until you’re left with a green sauce – this is your chermoula

### Step 3

Cut your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces and add them to a bowl with half the chermoula (save the rest for later!)

Give them a good mix up until they are fully coated and set aside to marinate

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char slightly

Once charred, reduce the heat to medium and add the sliced onion and remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min further or until slightly softened

### Step 5

Meanwhile, add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and half your vegetable stock mix, then cover and set aside until all the stock has been absorbed

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1630491812438-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Dissolve your tomato paste and the remaining vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout and remaining ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened slightly

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1630491840708-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Whilst the sauce is thickening, chop your sun-dried tomatoes roughly

Once the sauce has thickened, sit the marinated basa on top and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your chermoula basa tagine

Mix the chopped sun-dried tomatoes through the softened couscous

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the chermoula basa tagine with the sun-dried tomato couscous to the side

Spoon the remaining chermoula over the fish and serve with a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!
