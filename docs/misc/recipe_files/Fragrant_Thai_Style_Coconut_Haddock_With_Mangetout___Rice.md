## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving


### Step 2

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips


### Step 3

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the tomato wedges and sliced pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften


### Step 4

Once softened, add your ginger & garlic paste and red Thai curry paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 5

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, a squeeze of lime juice and your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [420ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person


### Step 6

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and season them with a pinch of salt

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Add the seasoned haddock bites to the pan and cook, covered, for an initial 2-3 min


### Step 7

After 2-3 min, add your mangetout and cook, covered, for a further 3 min or until until the fish is cooked through and the veg has slightly softened – this is your fragrant Thai coconut haddock with mangetout

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

### Step 8

Serve the fragrant Thai coconut haddock with mangetout with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with a good grind of black pepper and a lime wedge

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out
