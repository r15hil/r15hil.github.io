### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packets and let them air

Cut the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (skin on) into chips and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt and a knob of butter then scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to the tray

### Step 2

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the corn is tender and the chips are golden and crisp – these are your corn on the cob & chips

Halve any large pieces of diced chicken breast

Combine 30ml <span class="text-danger">[60ml]</span> milk with half the red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a large bowl and add the diced chicken breast – this is your marinated chicken

Tip: Don't worry if the mixture looks a little lumpy, it's meant to be!

### Step 3

Line a separate baking tray with baking paper

Combine the panko breadcrumbs and half the smoked paprika in a medium bowl with 3/4 of the cracked black pepper (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your black pepper crumb

Add the diced chicken breast to the black pepper crumb gradually (reserving the bowl with any remaining marinade) and press down evenly until fully coated – this is your black pepper crumbed chicken

### Step 4

Transfer the black pepper crumbed chicken to a baking paper-lined tray and season with a generous pinch of salt

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your black pepper popcorn chicken

### Step 5

Slice the chicken thighs into strips and sprinkle with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and the remaining red wine vinegar to the reserved marinade bowl with the cornflour, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour, the ground coriander, remaining smoked paprika, remaining cracked black pepper and a generous pinch of salt

Whisk everything together then add the coated chicken and mix well – these are your battered chicken strips

![Step 6 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-1655205797527-x200.jpg)

### Step 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add each battered chicken strip to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your fried chicken strips

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-1655205808848-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Meanwhile, peel and grate the garlic

Combine the shredded cabbage and half the cider vinegar in a bowl with half the mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your slaw

Add the remaining mayo and remaining cider vinegar to a small bowl with the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) – this is your garlic mayo dip

### Step 8

Set the black pepper popcorn chicken in the centre of the table with the fried chicken strips, ready to share

Serve the chips, corn on the cob, slaw and the garlic mayo dip to the side and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!
