## Ingredients

- British beef mince (125g) x0
- Natural yoghurt (80g)
- Tomato
- Wholemeal pittas (2pcs)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Ground sumac (1tsp)
- Dried chilli flakes (0.5tsp)
- Dried oregano (1tsp)
- British beef mince (250g)
- Cucumber (0.5pcs)
- Parsley (10g)
- Garlic clove
- Lemon
- Red onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and slice half your red onion[s] very finely

Finely dice (or grate) the remaining onion

Chop half your parsley finely, including the stalks (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic


### Step 2

Add your beef mince, panko breadcrumbs, diced onion, chopped garlic, chopped parsley, dried oregano and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your beef mixture


### Step 3

Divide the beef mixture into 3 kebabs per person and roll into small sausage shapes – these are your Cypriot-style beef mince kebabs

Lightly oil a baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil and add the Cypriot-style beef mince kebabs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the kebabs are cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)


### Step 4

Whilst the kebabs are cooking, cut your cucumber[s] in half lengthways, then slice roughly on a diagonal

Dice your tomato[es]

Roughly tear the remaining parsley


### Step 5

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this are your chilli pitta[s]


### Step 6

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half


### Step 7

Add the sliced cucumber, diced tomato, sliced onion and torn parsley to a bowl

Add your natural yoghurt with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp] </span>olive oil, the juice of half your lemon[s], half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and cut the chilli pitta[s] in half

### Step 8

Serve the Cypriot-style beef mince kebabs with the sumac salad and chilli pitta to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining ground sumac and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!
