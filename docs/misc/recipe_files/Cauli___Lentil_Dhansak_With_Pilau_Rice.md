## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Cut the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small florets, discard the stem and leaves


### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter alternative and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the garam masala, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground turmeric and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


### Step 3

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water

Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half


### Step 4

Once fragrant, add the rinsed red lentils and vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 15-18 min or until the lentils are almost tender

While the lentils are cooking, crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife


### Step 5

Heat a pot, with a matching lid, with a knob of butter alternative over a medium heat, add the cardamom pods and star anise and cook for 1 min or until toasted

Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


### Step 6

Once the lentils are almost tender, add the cauliflower florets and mango chutney and cook for 4-5 min further or until the cauliflower is cooked through and the lentils are tender

Once done, stir in the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon – this is your cauli & lentil dhansak


### Step 7

Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Remove the star anise and cardamom pods from the rice – this is your pilau rice

### Step 8

Serve the cauli & lentil dhansak over the pilau rice

Garnish with the chopped coriander and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
