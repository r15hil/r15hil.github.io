## Instructions


### Step 1

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, transfer to a plate and set aside to cool, reserve the pot

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air


### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and 40ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> very cold water in a small bowl – this is your soy stock

Add 40g<span class="text-purple"> [60g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> flour and 3/4 of your cornflour to a separate large bowl with half your rice wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and the soy stock

Stir it all together until fully combined with no lumps, then set aside – this is your batter


### Step 3

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]


### Step 4

Combine the remaining cornflour in a jug with 125ml <span class="text-purple">[190ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water

Add your tomato ketchup, remaining soy sauce and remaining rice vinegar with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and mix it all together – this is your sweet & sour sauce


### Step 5

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic to the pot with your ginger paste and garden veg mix and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked rice to the pot, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min further or until hot

Once hot, remove the pot from the heat and set aside (lid on) until serving – this is your vegetable fried rice


### Step 6

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken to a bowl with a sprinkle of flour and toss until the chicken is fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat


### Step 7

Once hot, dip the floured chicken pieces into the batter and turn several times until fully coated

Add the coated chicken pieces to the pan and cook for 12-15 min, turning occasionally, or until cooked through, golden and crispy (no pink meat!) – these are your Chinese takeaway-style chicken balls

Once the chicken is nearly cooked, microwave the sweet & sour sauce for 2 min or until thickened, stirring halfway

### Step 8

Serve the Chinese takeaway-style chicken balls with the vegetable fried rice and sweet & sour sauce to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!
