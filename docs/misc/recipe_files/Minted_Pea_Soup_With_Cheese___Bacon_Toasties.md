- 2 ciabattas
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 1 white potato
- 320g blanched peas
- 10g mint
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Peel the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and chop into very small pieces

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 2

Add the smoked streaky bacon to one side of a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Meanwhile, boil a full kettle and set some butter aside near a warm place to get to room temperature for easy spreading later on


### Step 3

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a large pot with a lid over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the onions are beginning to soften

Add the chopped potato, chopped garlic and bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and cook for 1-2 min further


### Step 4

Once softened, add the vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>into the pan and add 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Strip the mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Slice the cheddar cheese into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> thin slices

Slice the ciabattas in half and butter both bases


### Step 5

Remove the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven

Add one rasher of smoked streaky bacon to each ciabatta base (save the remaining rashers for later) and layer 4 cheese slices on top

Add both the ciabatta bases and lids (cut side up) to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted


### Step 6

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add the mint leaves and blanched peas to the pot and cook for 2-3 min further


### Step 7

Remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your minted pea soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!

### Step 8

Sandwich the ciabatta bases and lids together and cut them in half diagonally – these are your cheese & bacon toasties

Serve the minted pea soup in bowls with the cheese & bacon toasties to the side

Break the remaining smoked streaky bacon into shards and sprinkle over the soup

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and enjoy!
