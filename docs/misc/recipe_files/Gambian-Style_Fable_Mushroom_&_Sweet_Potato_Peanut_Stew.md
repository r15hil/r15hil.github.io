### Step 1

Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil

### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned
