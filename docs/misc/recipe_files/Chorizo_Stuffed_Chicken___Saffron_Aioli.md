## Description

A bit of a show off one this one! You'll stuff the chicken skin with chorizo, which seasons and flavours the meat as it cooks. You'll serve a rather dramatic-looking black rice, flavoured with roasted romano peppers, lemon and parsley to the side. Channel your inner artist as you drizzle with a saffron aioli (garlic mayonnaise)!

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Chop the chorizo as small as you can


Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-size pieces

### Step 2

Add the black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook for 30 min or until tender&nbsp;


Once cooked, drain and return to the pot


Tip: black rice has got a bite to it, so don't worry if you think it's not cooked after 30 min, it will be!

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add the saffron to a bowl and cover in 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;boiled water and set aside


Tip: soaking saffron in hot water infuses the water, bringing out its colour and flavour

### Step 5

Add the romano&nbsp;pepper&nbsp;to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and sit the stuffed chicken over the peppers&nbsp;(this will prevent the peppers from burning)


Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the pepper has softened and the chicken is cooked through

### Step 6

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks


Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic


Add the mayonnaise to the bowl with the saffron and water&nbsp;and mix well


Add the&nbsp;garlic and season with salt and pepper - this is your saffron aioli

### Step 7

Once cooked, transfer the stuffed chicken to a clean chopping board and leave it to rest for 3-4 min


Stir the cooked peppers and the roasting juices through the black rice


Add the chopped&nbsp;parsley and&nbsp;1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> lemon juice&nbsp;to the rice and season with both&nbsp;salt and pepper&nbsp;


Once rested, carefully slice the chicken with a sharp knife&nbsp;

### Step 8

Serve the sliced chicken over the black rice and drizzle the lot artistically with your&nbsp;saffron aioli


Enjoy!
