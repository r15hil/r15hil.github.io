## Ingredients

- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 15g flaked almonds
- 2 British chicken breast portions
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 150g cavolo nero
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red pepper
- 1 lemon

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a full kettle

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-size pieces

Crush the garlic clove<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin


### Step 2

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the chopped pepper to the middle with the crushed garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the pepper to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the pepper has softened


### Step 3

Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Season the chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper – this is your peppery chicken


### Step 4

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add the flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!

Transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl and return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


### Step 5

Once the pan is hot, add the peppery chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then remove from the heat

Remove the softened pepper parcel from the oven and add the browned chicken (use tin foil to avoid mess!) to the tray, reserve the pan

Return the tray to the oven for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing


### Step 6

Add the softened pepper & garlic, ground smoked paprika, most of the toasted almonds (save a few for garnish!) and the juice from 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon to a food processor

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until you have a coarse paste – this is your romesco sauce


### Step 7

Wash, then chop the cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Add the chopped cavolo nero to the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil and a splash of water and cook for 3-4 min or until wilted

Squeeze the remaining lemon juice into the cooked bulgur wheat and give it a good mix up – this is your lemony bulgur wheat

### Step 8

Serve the lemony bulgur wheat and cavolo nero with the sliced peppery chicken over the top

Dollop over the romesco sauce and garnish with the remaining toasted almonds

Enjoy!
