### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Tip: This is to warm your tortillas later – alternatively pop them in the microwave on a plate

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can!)

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

### Step 2

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced onion to the pan with the smoked paprika and BBQ sauce

Cook for 4 min or until the vegetables begin to soften

### Step 3

Once the vegetables begin to soften, add the meat-free chicken to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min, or until everything is warmed through – this is your sweet 'n' smoky BBQ meat-free chicken fajita filling

### Step 4

While everything is cooking, chop the tomatoes roughly, until they resemble a salsa-like consistency

### Step 5

Add the chopped tomato to a bowl with the chilli flakes (cooking for kids? Skip the chilli!), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Stir it all together – this is your salsa

### Step 6

Add the tortillas to a baking tray

Put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!
