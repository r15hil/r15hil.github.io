## Ingredients

- British chicken breast portion x0
- Gem lettuce
- Tomato x2
- Soft cheese (50g)
- Sun-dried tomatoes (30g)
- Panko breadcrumbs (30g)
- Dried basil (1tsp)
- White potato x3
- British chicken breast portions (2pcs)
- Red wine vinegar (15ml)
- Garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with your dried basil, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your basil roasties


### Step 2

While the potatoes are cooking, peel your garlic

Combine your sun-dried tomatoes and the peeled garlic in a food processor with your soft cheese, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato filling

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic finely and mix with the soft cheese


### Step 3

Use a sharp knife to cut a deep cross along the top of the chicken breast portions (be careful not to cut all the way through!) to make a pocket

Fill the pockets with the creamy sun-dried tomato filling and press it down with the back of a spoon


### Step 4

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your crumb

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a separate plate


### Step 5

Coat the stuffed chicken breasts in the oil, then press them into the crumb firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken


### Step 6

Transfer the breaded chicken, filling-side up, to a baking paper-lined baking tray and drizzle over a little olive oil

Put the tray in oven for 20-22 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato stuffed chicken


### Step 7

Chop your tomatoes roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Combine the shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and your red wine vinegar – this is your lettuce & tomato salad

### Step 8

Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato stuffed chicken with the basil roasties and lettuce & tomato salad to the side

Enjoy!
