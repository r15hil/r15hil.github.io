## Instructions


### Step 1

Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)


### Step 2

Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, season with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily


### Step 3

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 25g <span class="text-purple">[35g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [50g]</span> butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add your gnocchi with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown slightly


### Step 4

Meanwhile, cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper


### Step 5

When the gnocchi has browned slightly, add your Chinese rice wine and roasted garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant


### Step 6

Once fragrant, add the spinach and cook for 1 min, stirring frequently, or until just starting to wilt

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl along with a little olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice– this is your salad


### Step 7

Once the spinach has wilted, add your grated Italian hard cheese and the juice of half your lemon wedges and give everything a good mix up

Season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your spinach & lemon gnocchi

### Step 8

Serve the cooked salmon over the spinach & lemon gnocchi with the salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!
