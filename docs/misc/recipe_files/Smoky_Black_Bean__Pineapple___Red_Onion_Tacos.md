## Instructions


### Step 1

Peel your red onion[s] and slice some rings off (2 per person!) as finely as you can, then dice the remaining red onion

Add the onion rings and your red wine vinegar to a shallow bowl and set aside to pickle until serving – these are your quick-pickled onion rings


### Step 2

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened


### Step 3

Meanwhile, chop your coriander as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine your mayo with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and the chopped coriander in a small bowl – this is your herby mayo


### Step 4

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your black beans

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and drained black beans to the pan

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce, then cook for a further 5-6 min or until the black beans are starting to crisp – these are your smoky black beans


### Step 5

Wash your lettuce, then separate the outer lettuce leaves and finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain and finely dice your pineapple slices

Tip: Don’t chuck the pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa


### Step 6

Add the tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through


### Step 7

Drain the quick-pickled onion rings and discard the liquid

### Step 8

Top your warmed tortillas with a dollop of herby mayo and the lettuce leaves

Spoon over the smoky black beans, top with the pineapple salsa and garnish with the quick-pickled onion rings – these are your smoky black bean, pineapple & red onion tacos

Enjoy!
