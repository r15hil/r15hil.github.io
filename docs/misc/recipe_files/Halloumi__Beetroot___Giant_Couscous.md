## Description

We've tossed our giant couscous with crispy fried shallots and almonds for maximum texture. It's then drizzled with a cider vinegar dressing and some fresh dill. On top sits oven-grilled halloumi sticks and beetroot. The dish gets a final smattering of dill and a dried citrus herb called sumac. Lip sumac-ing!

## Ingredients

- 1 bag of blanched almonds
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp lemony sumac 
- 10g fresh dill
- 225g Cypriot halloumi
- 2 shallots
- 2 garlic cloves 
- 250g cooked beetroot
- 150g giant couscous

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle


Drain the beetroot and cut into wedges


Remove the halloumi from its package and press it firmly between kitchen roll or a tea towel to remove the liquid


Slice the halloumi into thick sticks


### Step 2

Place the beetroot on a large, non-stick oven tray (or use foil to avoid mess)


Drizzle&nbsp;with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(1 tbsp)</span> olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper


Push to one side of the tray and set aside until step 5


Preheat the grill to medium-high


### Step 3

Add the giant couscous to a pot with 500ml <span class="text-danger">(800ml)</span>&nbsp;boiling water and return to the boil over a high heat


Boil for 5-7 min or until tender but with a slight bite


Drain and rinse briefly under cool water (to remove the excess starch which can make it stick together)


Set aside until step 7


### Step 4

Meanwhile, bash (in a bag with a rolling pin) or chop the almonds coarsely


Peel,&nbsp;halve and slice the shallots finely


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


### Step 5

Place the beetroot under the grill for 5 min or until it has started to release moisture, then remove the tray briefly


Add the halloumi sticks to the opposite side of the tray


Return the tray to the grill for a further 8-12 min or until the halloumi is golden, flipping halfway


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the cider vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(4 tbsp)</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> boiled water and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">(1 tsp)</span> sugar in a small bowl


Whisk together until the sugar is dissolved - this is your dressing


Roughly chop the dill, including the stalks


### Step 7

Place a wide-based pan over a medium heat with 1-3 tbsp olive oil


Once hot, add the almonds, shallot and garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until browned and crispy, stirring constantly


Remove the pan from the heat and mix in the cooked couscous


Season lightly with salt and pepper

### Step 8

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of the dressing and 3/4 of the dill to the couscous and mix well


Remove the tray from the grill


Serve the almond couscous and top with the beetroot, halloumi, remaining dressing and dill and sprinkle with sumac
