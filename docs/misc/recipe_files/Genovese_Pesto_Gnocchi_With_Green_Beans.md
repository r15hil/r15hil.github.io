## Ingredients

- 80g trimmed fine green beans
- 350g gnocchi
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 bag of pine nuts (20g)
- 1 red wine vinegar sachet (15ml)
- 40g basil
- 50g rocket
- 1 garlic clove

## Instructions


### Step 1

Boil a kettle

Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!


### Step 2

Meanwhile, chop the green beans in half

Chop the basil roughly, including the stalks

Peel and roughly chop the garlic


### Step 3

Add the chopped basil, garlic, 3/4 of the toasted pine nuts and 3/4 of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) to a food processor and blitz until the ingredients resemble a fine crumb


### Step 4

Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> olive oil to the food processor and blitz until smooth

Season generously with salt – this is your pesto alla Genovese

Tip: Taste the pesto and add a pinch more salt if needed!


### Step 5

Add the green beans to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for an initial 2 min

Add the gnocchi and cook for 3 min further or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water


### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and stir it all together

Wash and pat the rocket dry

Add the washed rocket and toss with the dressing – this is your rocket salad


### Step 7

Return the drained gnocchi and green beans to the pot with the pesto alla Genovese and a splash of starchy cooking water and give everything a good mix up – this is your Genovese pesto gnocchi with green beans

### Step 8

Serve the Genovese pesto gnocchi with green beans and the rocket salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining toasted pine nuts and grated Italian hard cheese

Buon appetito!
