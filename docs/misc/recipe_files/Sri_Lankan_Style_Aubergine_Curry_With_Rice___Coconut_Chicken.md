### Step 1

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Combine the creamed coconut and half the turmeric in a medium bowl with 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [80ml]</span> boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then stir until the coconut cream has fully dissolved – this is your coconut marinade

Once dissolved, add the chicken thighs to the marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side until slightly browned

While the chicken is cooking, trim the green stalk off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and slice, lengthways into bite-sized pieces

### Step 3

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Once the chicken has slightly browned, transfer it to a baking paper-lined tray (reserve the pan!) and put in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your coconut chicken

### Step 4

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and add the chopped aubergine with a pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened and charred

Boil half a kettle 

Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife, then discard the outer green pods

### Step 5

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Once the aubergine is charred, add the chopped ginger and garlic with the tomato paste and cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the cardamom seeds, black mustard seeds, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining turmeric to the pan, mix it all together and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

### Step 6

Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

![Step 7 Image](https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-1669137180728-x200.jpg)

### Step 7

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock to the pan with 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has reduced and the aubergine is very tender – this is your Sri Lankan-style aubergine curry

### Step 8

Serve the Sri Lankan-style aubergine curry over the rice with the coconut chicken to the side

Enjoy!
