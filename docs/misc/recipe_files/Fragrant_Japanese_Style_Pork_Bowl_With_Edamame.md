## Instructions


### Step 1

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then leave to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


### Step 2

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!


### Step 3

Whilst the sushi rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger


### Step 4

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required) and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go


### Step 5

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the blanched edamame beans to a bowl and microwave for 1 min, or until hot and cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the edamame beans and add them to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil – these are your sesame edamame beans


### Step 6

Once the pork has browned, add the chopped ginger, mirin, soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> sugar to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min further or until fragrant and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fragrant Japanese-style pork


### Step 7

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pot and cook for 1-2 min, mixing vigorously, until firm and scrambled

Tip: Try scrambling the egg with chopsticks if you have some!

### Step 8

Arrange the sushi rice, fragrant Japanese-style pork, sesame edamame beans and scrambled egg in bowls

Sprinkle your shichimi togarashi all over (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!
