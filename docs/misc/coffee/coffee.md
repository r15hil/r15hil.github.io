|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flavor 🍫     | 4/5    | Good balance; nutty notes, bitterness is even though it's a 4/5 strength roast but not a bad thing               |
| Aroma 🌸      | 2/5    | Lacking                                                                                                          |
| Mouthfeel 🥛 | 3/5    | Medium texture, acidity was fine, slight lingering                                                                |
| **Overall** ⭐| **3/5**| Enjoyable but overpriced; wouldn't choose regularly                                                               |

**Notes:**  
A decent blend, but the high price and lacking aroma reduce the score.

## Ueshima Coffee Company - House Blend ☕
**Roaster/Brand:** Ueshima Coffee Company  
**Origin:** "Between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn"  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £9.00 / 500g beans

|--------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flavor 🍫     | 3/5    | Mainly bitter with a subtle hint of sweetness. Dark roast (4/5 strength)                          |
| Aroma 🌸      | 4/5    | Very pleasant; sweet with caramel notes.                                                          |
| Mouthfeel 🥛 | 3/5    | Slightly thick but unexpectedly drying, even though they claim low acidity.                       |
| **Overall** ⭐| **3/5**| Solid coffee but mouthfeel detracts slightly from overall experience.                            |

**Notes:**  
Dry mouthfeel was a surprising drawback, otherwise would be 1 point higher.
On the back it says roasted in Europe but crafting methods developed by their Japanese coffee masters.
