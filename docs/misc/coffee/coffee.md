☕ I drink coffee black unless it's an iced coffee but I won't rate those on here.




## M&S - French Style

**Roaster/Brand:** M&S  
**Origin:** United Kingdom (that's what it says???)  
**Roast:**: Dark  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £7.95 / 500g  
**Rating:** 4/5  

**Notes:**
Really enjoyable. Deep flavour, sweet but in an earthy heavy sense. Medium mouth feel, not a lot of aroma though. No bitterness or drying feeling. Reliable dark roast.




## Union - Revelation Blend

**Roaster/Brand:** Union  
**Origin:** Guatemala, El Salvador, Rwanda, Burundi and Costa Rica  
**Roast:**: Dark  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £18.75 / 500g  
**Rating:** 2/5  

**Notes:**
Was alright, nothing special. Wasn't much flavour, just hint of sweetness.



## Coffee World - Greek Coffee Special

Got this as a gift, not entirely sure it was actually roasted in Greece though...

**Roaster/Brand:** Coffee Island  
**Origin:** Brazil, Ethiopia, India  
**Roast:** Dark  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £26.00 / 500g (I think)  
**Rating:** 3/5  

**Notes:**
Good bitterness and acidity but not too acidic. Heavy mouthfeel in a good way. Deep earthy aroma. Solid coffee overall.



## M&S - Organic Nicaraguan Ground Coffee

I accidentally bought ground coffee, didn't check if they were beans but we move...

**Roaster/Brand:** Marks & Spencer  
**Origin:** Nicaragua  
**Roast:** Medium  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £10.46 / 500g  
**Rating:** 3/5  

**Notes:**
Smooth, slightly chocolatey with a hint of nuttiness and gentle depth. Subtle chocolate aroma that fills the room lightly. Pleasant medium-full body. Another reliable M&S coffee, pretty solid medium roast option.



## Pact Coffee - House Blend ☕

**Roaster/Brand:** Pact Coffee  
**Origin:** Blend  
**Roast:** Medium/Dark  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £19.90 / 500g  
**Rating:** 4/5  

**Notes:**
Milk-chocolatey with light caramel sweetness, medium-full body, subtle aroma. Reliable but a bit pricey — can get better value elsewhere.



## M&S - Peruvian Coffee Beans ☕

**Roaster/Brand:** Marks & Spencer  
**Origin:** Peru  
**Roast:** Dark  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £9.91 / 500g

Deep earthy notes, bold roast without overwhelming bitterness. Fills the kitchen with pleasant nutty scent. Reliable choice for a stronger roast.



## M&S - Roast & Ritual ☕

**Roaster/Brand:** Marks & Spencer  
**Origin:** Brazil, Ethiopia, Peru  
**Roast:** Medium/Light  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Price:** £7.71 / 500g  
**Rating:** 4/5  
**Notes:**
Sweet, earthy, fruity flavor with hardly any bitterness. Mild aroma but great mouthfeel. Extremely reliable everyday coffee.



## Caravan - The Daily All Day Blend ☕

**Roaster/Brand:** Caravan  
**Origin:** Guatemala, Peru, Brazil  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress  
**Roast:** Medium/Dark  
**Price:** £16.00 / 500g

Nutty notes with balanced bitterness. Aroma lacking but decent flavor. Enjoyable but overpriced; wouldn’t choose regularly.

**Origin:** Between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn  
**Roast:** Medium/Dark  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress
