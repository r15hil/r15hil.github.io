|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Ueshima Coffee Company - House Blend ☕
**Roaster/Brand:** Ueshima Coffee Company  
**Origin:** "Between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn"  
**Brew Method:** AeroPress

| Mouthfeel 🥛 | 3/5    | Slightly thick but unexpectedly drying, even though they claim low acidity.                       |
| **Overall** ⭐| **3/5**| Solid coffee but mouthfeel detracts slightly from overall experience.                            |

**Notes:**  
Dry mouthfeel was a surprising drawback, otherwise would be 1 point higher.
On the back it says roasted in Europe but crafting methods developed by their Japanese coffee masters.
