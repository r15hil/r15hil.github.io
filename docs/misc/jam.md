# 🎬 **Jam** 🎉

Guess the movie based on one-word clues that become increasingly revealing 🍿

## **Objective** 🏆

Guess the movie being described through a series of one-word clues before you run out of guesses.

## **How to Play** 🎮

**IMPORTANT:** A submitted clue MUST relate to all the provided clue words. The "Allower" is the one who decidces whether they'll "allow it". The guessers can justify their movie choice and why it relates to all the clues if the "Allower" is not convinced. At the end of the day, the clue is only valid if the "allower" says **"I'll allow it"**.

As soon as the correct movie is guessed the game ends.

1. ### **First Clue** 🕵️

   - The **Allower** provides **one word** related to the movie.
   - Players can submit guesses.
   - You have up to **5 guesses** at this stage.

2. ### **Second Clue** 🔍

   - After **5 wrong answers**, a **second word** is revealed.
   - Players can submit new guesses.
   - Now you have up to **4 guesses**.

3. ### **Third Clue** 🧩

   - After **4 more wrong answers**, a **third word** is given.
   - Players can guess again.
   - You have up to **3 guesses**.

4. ### **Fourth Clue** 🗝️

   - After **3 additional wrong answers**, a **fourth word** is shared.
   - Players submit guesses.
   - You have up to **2 guesses**.

5. ### **Fifth Clue** 🎁

   - After **2 more wrong answers**, the final **fifth word** is provided.
   - Players make their last guesses.
   - Only **1 guess** is allowed now.

6. ### **Victory or Defeat** ⚖️

   - **Game Ends** when:
     - The movie is guessed correctly 🎉
     - All guesses are used up without the correct answer 😢


## **Rules Recap** 📜

- **Clues are cumulative**: Each new word adds to the previous clues.
- **Guess wisely**: Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts.
- **Team Play**: Collaborate with others! 👥
- **Be convincing**: Players should try and convince the "Allower" on why clues relate, if any uncertainty. Sometimes waffling to the "Allower" will end up with them "allowing" it.
