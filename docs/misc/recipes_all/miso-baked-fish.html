<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Bash the lemongrass (to release the juices) and lay flat before slicing it down the middle

Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook covered for 10-15 min or until the water is absorbed, checking occasionally


Combine the miso paste and honey in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> hot water


Mix well into a smooth sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the pak choi in half lengthways through the root


Tip: Cutting through the root helps it stay together while cooking


Heat a dry, wide-based pan with matching lid on a high heat&nbsp;


When hot, add the pak choi (cut side down) and cook for 3 min or until charring (families might need to do this in batches)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is done, discard the lemongrass and fluff with a fork for serving


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> finely, discarding the root ends</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fish with the pak choi and rice to the side


Tip: For fun presentation, transfer the rice into small bowls or cups, pat down firmly and turn out onto the serving plates


Scatter with spring onions and enjoy!</p><br><br>
