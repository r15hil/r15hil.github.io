<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Peel and finely slice the onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Chop the sweet potatoes (skins on) into bite-size pieces


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Place the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a pot, with a matching lid, with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the basmati&nbsp;rice, sultanas and 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;cold water


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the eggs to a separate pot of salted boiled water over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)


Once boiling, boil for exactly 7 min, for perfect, mid-boiled eggs


Meanwhile, fill a bowl of very cold water with ice (Gousto's ice packs are perfect) ready for cooling your eggs quickly later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the onion with a big pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until slightly softened


Once softened, add the sweet potato, garlic, curry powder and turmeric and cook for 5 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, once the eggs are done, drain and add them to your ice water (this stops them from cooking further and helps them peel easier)


Tip: no ice? Run them under very cold running water for 3 min, then set aside in a bowl of cold water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water


Combine the softened coconut cream with the stock and add it to the pan


Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 5-10 min or until the sweet potato is fork- tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the cooled eggs and cut them in half


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks


Stir a large knob of butter through the cooked rice and season generously with salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Gently stir the eggs into the curry until warmed


Remove from the heat and stir in the coriander


Serve&nbsp;the curry over the buttered rice and garnish with nigella seeds


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
