<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/gas 7 and boil a kettle

Pierce your red potato[es] a few times with a fork, then add to a heatproof bowl and cook in the microwave for 8-12 min or until softened

Add the softened potato[es] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked and crispy on the outside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim your green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Combine half your chipotle paste (save the rest for later!) with your soured cream – this is your spicy soured cream

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, ground paprika, and a pinch of salt in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your paprika stock

Drain and rinse your sweetcorn and black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the drained black beans and sweetcorn with the remaining chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the chopped garlic, paprika stock and a pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is cooking, add your green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a splash of cold water and a small drizzle of olive oil

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the baked red potato[es] are cooked and crispy on the outside, remove from the oven and carefully slice in half down the middle (careful, it will be hot!)

Once the sauce has thickened, add the chopped coriander stalks and half the grated cheddar cheese (save the rest for later!) to the pan with the beans and give everything a good mix up – these are your chipotle black beans

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the chopped coriander stalks!</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the sliced potato[es] with your chipotle black beans, spicy soured cream, remaining grated cheddar cheese and coriander leaves with the green beans to the side

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Top with the plain soured cream and grated cheddar cheese!</span>

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
