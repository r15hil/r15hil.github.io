<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>,<span class="text-danger"> </span>then peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear into small, bite-sized pieces

Wash the rocket and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the ultimate vegan burger patties with half the Henderson’s Relish (save the rest for later!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way) – this is your meatball mixture

Divide the meatball mixture into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4] </span>balls, then flatten into circles (big enough to enclose the mozzarella)

Split half the torn mozzarella (you'll use the rest later!) equally between each meatball</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wrap the meatball mix around the filling to form 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> meatballs and seal them tightly on all sides so that there aren't any gaps – these are your meat-free meatballs

Add the meat-free meatballs to a baking paper-lined oven-proof dish and drizzle with a little olive oil

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until lightly golden and firm on top</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, the remaining Henderson's Relish, half the balsamic vinegar (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous pinch of sugar in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your balsamic stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has slightly caramelised, add the chopped garlic and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and stock with a very generous grind of black pepper

Stir it all together and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-14 min or until thickened, stirring occasionally – this is your rich tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is cooking, bring a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the spaghetti and cook for 7-8 min or until almost cooked

Tip: Your pasta will finish cooking in the sauce!

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free meatballs are cooked, remove them from the oven and top with the remaining torn mozzarella

Return the dish to the oven and cook for a final 7-9 min or until the mozzarella is melted and lightly golden – these are your ‘love volcano’ meat-free meatballs

Combine the cooked spaghetti with the rich tomato sauce and a splash of starchy pasta water, then cook for a final 1-2 min or until the sauce is thick and coating the spaghetti – this is your rich tomato spaghetti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir 1/3 of the TABASCO® Sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) through the rich tomato spaghetti

Serve the spaghetti topped with a 'love volcano' meat-free meatball, drizzle the remaining TABASCO® Sauce (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the top and season with a pinch of pepper

Garnish with the rocket drizzled with the remaining balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
