<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated carrot, chopped ginger and chopped shallot and cook for 3 min

Add your curry powder and cook for a further 2 min

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the vegetables evenly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to low, then add your soy sauce and stir through your mango chutney and cook for 5-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Season with a generous pinch of salt, cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu sauce

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 5-6 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Combine your rice vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Add your shredded lettuce and the carrot ribbons to the bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spoon the katsu sauce onto the plate and serve the breaded basa over the sauce with the cooked rice and salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
