<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add half the chopped garlic to a food processor with the chopped coriander & parsley

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces and add them to a bowl with half the chermoula (save the rest for later!)

Give them a good mix up until they are fully coated and set aside to marinate

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char slightly

Once charred, reduce the heat to medium and add the sliced onion and remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min further or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and half your vegetable stock mix, then cover and set aside until all the stock has been absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your tomato paste and the remaining vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout and remaining ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is thickening, chop your sun-dried tomatoes roughly

Once the sauce has thickened, sit the marinated basa on top and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your chermoula basa tagine

Mix the chopped sun-dried tomatoes through the softened couscous

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chermoula basa tagine with the sun-dried tomato couscous to the side

Spoon the remaining chermoula over the fish and serve with a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
