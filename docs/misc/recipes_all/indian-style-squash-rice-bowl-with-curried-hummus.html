<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, sultanas, half the ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana rice</p><br><br>
