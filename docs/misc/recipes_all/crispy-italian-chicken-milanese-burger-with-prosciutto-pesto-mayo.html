<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with your dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your oregano chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, cut 1 slice per person from your tomato[es] and set aside for serving

Chop the remaining tomato finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Combine your pesto and mayo in a small bowl – this is your pesto mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Add a handful of flour to a plate, a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate

Season the flattened chicken with a pinch of salt, coat in flour, tap off any excess, then add to the milk and firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken Milanese

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the ciabatta halves to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray and drizzle with a little olive oil

Add your sliced prosciutto to the other side of the tray and put in the oven for 6-7 min or until the ciabattas are golden and the prosciutto is crisp

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the chopped tomato, balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil and toss it all together – this is your rocket salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread a dollop of pesto mayo over the toasted ciabatta base

Top with a handful of rocket salad, the sliced tomato, chicken Milanese, Italian hard cheese shavings, crispy prosciutto and a toasted ciabatta lid

Serve with the oregano chips, remaining pesto mayo and rocket salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
