<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, sprinkle in your dried oregano, then add the seasoned salmon fillet[s] and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your oregano salmon

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the orzo is ready, remove it from the heat and stir through the chopped dill with a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your prasorizo-style dill orzo

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Discard the bay leaf[ves]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the prasorizo-style dill orzo topped with the oregano salmon and the salad to the side

Sprinkle over the toasted pine nuts and garnish with a lemon wedge

Season with a grind of black pepper and a small drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
