<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel your garlic

Add the peeled garlic and 3/4 of your pumpkin seeds (save the rest for later!) to a food processor with your basil, soft cheese and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your creamy pesto

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the ingredients and grind to a paste in a pestle & mortar instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the creamy pesto and salmon flakes in a bowl – this is your pasty filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the puff pastry into 1 rectangle per person and add to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top your pastry rectangle[s] with the pasty filling, covering only one half, then brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the mixture with as little air trapped inside as possible – this is your pasty[ies]

Prick air holes into the centre of the pasty[ies] evenly with a fork and press the remaining pumpkin seeds into the pastry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-20 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your creamy pesto salmon pasty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the salad with the chopped tomato, white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy pesto salmon pasty with the dressed salad and chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
