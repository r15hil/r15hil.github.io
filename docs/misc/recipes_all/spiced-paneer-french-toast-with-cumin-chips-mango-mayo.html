<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your cumin seeds and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your cumin chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Combine the sliced shallot and red wine vinegar in a bowl with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a small pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your paneer in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

Sprinkle half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) over the sliced paneer – this is your spiced paneer

Slice your ciabattas in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Crack your egg[s] into a wide bowl and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk and the remaining curry powder

Give everything a good mix up – this is your egg mixture

Dip the halved ciabatta, cut side down, into the egg mixture until it's been absorbed by the bread – this is your curried ciabatta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the french toast toastie and cook for 3-4 min on each side, pressing them down with a spatula until golden and crisp – this is your spiced paneer french toast</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Combine the quick-pickled shallot and the pickling liquid with the sliced cucumber, shredded lettuce and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your quick-pickled shallot salad

Add your mayo to a bowl with your mango chutney and give it a good mix up – this is your mango mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the spiced paneer french toast in half

Serve the sliced french toast with the cumin chips, quick-pickled shallot salad and mango mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
