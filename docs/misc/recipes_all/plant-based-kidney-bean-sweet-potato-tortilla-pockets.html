<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the potato is fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Drain and rinse your black beans

Combine 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour with a splash of cold water in a small bowl to form a thick paste – this is your flour paste

Combine your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the drained black beans, ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked sweet potato and tomato stock to the pot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your black bean & sweet potato mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your tortilla to a clean board and using your finger, rub some of the flour paste along the edge of one quarter of the tortilla

Fold the tortilla in half and press firmly to seal the bottom half, leaving an opening at the top

Tip: This will make filling your tortillas easier!

Repeat this with the remaining tortillas – these are your tortilla shells</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide the black bean & sweet potato mix between the tortilla shells

Use the remaining flour paste to seal the top half of the tortilla shells – these are your plant-based black bean & sweet potato tortilla pockets

Tip: Press firmly on the edges to make sure there are no gaps!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the plant-based black bean & sweet potato tortilla pockets to a baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crisp

While the tortilla pockets are cooking, combine the remaining ground smoked paprika, mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your paprika mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your red wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the dressing and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based black bean & sweet potato tortilla pockets with the dressed salad and a dollop of paprika mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
