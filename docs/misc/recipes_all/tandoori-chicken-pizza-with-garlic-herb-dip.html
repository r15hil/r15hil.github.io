<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Slice your chicken breast strips into thin strips, then cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the chicken strips, pepper slices, curry powder, ground paprika, ground turmeric, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tandoori-style chicken & peppers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add most of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with your tomato paste, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper

Add 5<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> water and give it a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the pizza base[s]

Top the pizza[s] with the tandoori-style chicken & peppers</p><br><br>
