<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the squash is roasting, boil a kettle

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once softened, add your arborio rice to the onion with the chopped garlic and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, peel some of your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings, then grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your sage leaves and cook for 1 min or until crispy, then transfer to kitchen paper and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the squash has had 15 min, add your pecans to the tray and return the tray to the oven for 5 min further or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once done, remove the roasted squash cubes and mash most of them up with a fork (save some for garnish!) to form a purée – this is your squash purée</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, stir the squash purée and soft cheese through the risotto

Add the grated Italian hard cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted and the rice is cooked – this is your butternut squash risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the butternut squash risotto topped with the cheese shavings, reserved roasted butternut squash, crispy sage leaves and toasted pecans

Season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
