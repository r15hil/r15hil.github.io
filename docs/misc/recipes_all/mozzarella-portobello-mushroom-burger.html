<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the walnuts and toast for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Once lightly toasted, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the toasted walnuts and garlic to a food processor, set aside and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>
