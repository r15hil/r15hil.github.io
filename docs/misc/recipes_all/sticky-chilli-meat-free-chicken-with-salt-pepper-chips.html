<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>sugar and lots of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your meat-free chick'n to a bowl with your cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the meat-free chick'n is coated

Tap off any excess cornflour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is very hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden and crispy – this is your crispy meat-free chick'n

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Finely slice your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any remaining oil from the crispy meat-free chick'n

Add the chopped pepper, chopped ginger and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your honey, red chilli relish and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

Once thickened, add the crispy meat-free chick'n to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the meat-free chick'n is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky meat-free chick'n</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray[s] and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky meat-free chick'n over the salt & pepper chips

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
