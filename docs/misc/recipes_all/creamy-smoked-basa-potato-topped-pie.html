<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle and chop your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail and dice your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and Dijon mustard in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add half the chopped garlic (you’ll use the rest later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock and soft cheese, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a small splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped smoked basa to the sauce with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy smoked basa pie filling

Wash your shredded kale, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the creamy smoked basa pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the mash (use individual oven dishes for fancy presentation!)

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the fish is cooked through and the pie is bubbling and golden – this is your creamy smoked basa potato-topped pie

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pie is almost done, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced carrot and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

After 5-6 min, add the shredded kale and remaining chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min further or until tender with a bite – this is your garlicky veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy smoked basa potato-topped pie with the garlicky veg to the side

Enjoy!
