Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Add the diced onion to the pan with a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and tofu cubes to the pan and give everything a good mix up, then cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your black bean paste and soy sauce in a bowl with your cornflour, toasted sesame oil, dried chilli flakes, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water to the bowl and mix until fully combined – this is your Sichuan-style spicy black bean sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your spinach to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach is wilted

Once wilted, add the Sichuan-style spicy sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened and everything is well coated – this is your Sichuan-style spicy black bean tofu</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sichuan-style spicy black bean tofu over the cooked rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion
