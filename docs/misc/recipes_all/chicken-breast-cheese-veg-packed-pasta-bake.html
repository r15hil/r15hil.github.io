<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your wholewheat tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the wholewheat tortiglioni and set aside until later

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until the chicken has browned and the courgette is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the courgette is beginning to soften, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock with the chopped tomato and your finely chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min further – this is your sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained wholewheat tortiglioni to the sauce with most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and mix it all up

Add half the pasta mixture to an oven-proof dish, then top with the grated cheddar cheese

Top with the remaining pasta mixture and grated Italian hard cheese and put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until all the cheese has melted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken breast & cheese veg-packed pasta bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken breast & cheese veg-packed pasta bake topped with the reserved chopped parsley and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!
