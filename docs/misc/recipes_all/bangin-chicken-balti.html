<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken has browned

Add the chicken stock and your chopped tomatoes with a pinch of sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your fragrant chicken balti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant chicken balti with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
