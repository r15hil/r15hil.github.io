<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deeseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Cut your lime[s] into quarters

Strip a few coriander leaves from their stalks and save for garnish

Chop the remaining coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine half your ginger paste (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of half your lime wedges in a large bowl

Add half your chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and stir it all together

Add your carrot, mooli slaw mix and chopped coriander (reserve the leaves for garnish) to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ginger salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [8 tbsp]</span> flour to a large bowl with your ground paprika, ground turmeric and a very generous pinch of salt

Mix until fully combined

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breast portion[s] to the bowl with 4 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [6 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tsp] </span>cold water

Give everything a good mix up and, using your hands, scrunch the flour onto the chicken so that it is well coated – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coated chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Burmese-style fried chicken

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your tamarind paste and soy sauce with your remaining ginger paste, the chopped garlic and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? just add a little!)

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water and a small squeeze of lime juice and mix it all together – this is your achin yay dipping sauce

Add your crispy onions to the ginger salad and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Burmese-style fried chicken with the basmati rice, ginger salad, achin yay dipping sauce and a lime wedge to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top the ginger salad with the reserved coriander leaves and garnish the rice with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
