<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop your broccoli into florets, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt, put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender, golden and crisp

Tip: Roasting the broccoli will help to remove excess moisture before adding to your sauce!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel, then dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the diced onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and dissolve your vegetable stock mix and Dijon mustard in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Once the vegetables have softened, add half the chopped garlic (you’ll use the rest later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, then add the vegetable stock and soft cheese

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the creamy sauce is thickening, drain your sweetcorn

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a small splash of milk

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth

Add the drained sweetcorn and roasted broccoli to the creamy sauce with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy pie filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the creamy pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the mash

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your creamy veg-packed potato-topped pie

Tip: Use individual oven dishes for fancy presentation!

Once the pie is almost done, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your shredded kale and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, add the shredded kale and remaining chopped garlic, then return to the heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your garlicky greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy veg-packed potato-topped pie with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!
