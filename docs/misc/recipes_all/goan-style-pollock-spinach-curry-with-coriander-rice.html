<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the grated ginger and grated garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the curry powder and ground turmeric to the onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the tomato paste, most of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 1 min

Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to reduce – this is your Goan-style curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then chop it roughly

Add the chopped spinach to the curry sauce and stir continuously for 1-2 min or until wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the spinach wilts, cut the pollock fillets into bite-sized pieces

Place the chopped pollock over the curry and cook, covered, for 6-7 min or until cooked through – this is your Goan-style pollock & spinach curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks, then stir most of it through the cooked rice (save some for garnish!) – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Goan-style pollock & spinach curry over the coriander rice and garnish with the reserved chopped coriander and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
