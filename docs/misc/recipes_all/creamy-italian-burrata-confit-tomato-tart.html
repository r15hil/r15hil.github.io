<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Spread the caramelised onions over the pastry within the border

Add the cherry tomatoes and top with the thyme leaves

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up – this is your confit tomato tart</p><br><br>
