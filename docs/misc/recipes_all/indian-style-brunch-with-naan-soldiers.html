<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the onion is cooking, chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once the onion has softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the tomatoes have started to break down

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your butter beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, butter beans, ground turmeric, curry powder, half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your black mustard seeds (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water to the potatoes with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add the remaining sliced onion to a small bowl and squeeze the juice of the lime[s] over, season with a pinch of salt and place the squeezed lime[s] on top for added pickling – this is your lime quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander roughly and cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are cooked, stir through your mango chutney and most of the chopped coriander (reserve a little for garnish) and cook for a further 3-4 min – these are your Bombay potatoes

Tip: If it's looking a little dry, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through, then cut into bite-sized fingers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the remaining black mustard seeds and crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking – this is your mustard seed egg

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Bombay potatoes with the naan fingers, mustard seed egg, lime quick-pickled onion and avocado to the side

Sprinkle the remaining dried chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the avocado

Garnish the Bombay potatoes with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
