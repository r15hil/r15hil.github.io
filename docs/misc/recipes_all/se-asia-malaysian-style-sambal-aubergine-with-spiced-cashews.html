<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways (including the stalk), then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin, then rub the cut sides of the aubergine with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Add the scored aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side down, and put in the oven for 25-30 min or until the flesh is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the aubergine is cooking, add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Chop your tomato[es] into quarters

Peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and finely dice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper, tomato and shallot to the pan with half the diced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and crushed garlic and cook for 5-7 min or until soft

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables are softened transfer them to a food processor (reserve the pan!) with your soy sauce, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar, sambal oelek and the juice of the zested lime

Blitz until smooth – this is your sambal sauce

Return the sambal sauce to the reserved pan on a low heat to keep warm</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is nearly ready, add your cashew nuts, coconut flakes and your remaining diced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Scrunch the foil around the cashews and coconut to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to the baking tray[s] for 10 min or until the nuts are browned and caramelised

Once caramelised add the lime zest and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy zesty nuts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted aubergine over the basmati rice and top with the warm sambal sauce

Garnish with the spicy zesty nuts and sliced spring onion

Cut your remaining lime into 1 wedge per person and serve to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
