<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the peppers are cooking, add your gluten free spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once cooked, drain the spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes are soft, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) crème fraîche, most of the chopped coriander, half your ground sumac (you'll use the rest later!) and a splash of starchy pasta water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy harissa, charred pepper & king prawn gluten free spaghetti

Tip: If it's looking a little dry add a splash more of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy harissa, charred pepper & king prawn gluten free spaghetti

Top with the remaining ground sumac, remaining chopped coriander and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
