<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the tortiglioni

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced courgette with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, dried basil, balsamic vinegar, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Chop the cherry tomatoes roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the courgette is beginning to soften, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock with the chopped cherry tomatoes and chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min further</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar cheese

Grate the Italian hard cheese

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tortiglioni to the sauce with the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and mix it up

Add half the pasta to an oven-proof dish, then top with the grated cheese

Top with the remaining pasta, torn mozzarella and grated Italian hard cheese and put the dish in the oven for 5-10 min or until all the cheese has melted – this is your 3 cheese veg-packed pasta bake</p><br><br>
