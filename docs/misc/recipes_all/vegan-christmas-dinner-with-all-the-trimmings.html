<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil to a baking tray and put the tray on the bottom shelf of the oven to heat up

Peel and halve the potatoes, then add them to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are boiling, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> veg stock mix (save the rest for later!) in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water and add the dried sage, panko breadcrumbs and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and shape into 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> stuffing balls</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop the parsnips into batons (keep the parsnip tips thick to stop them from burning!)

Trim and halve the Chantenay carrots (no need to peel!)

Add the parsnips and carrots to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Add the stuffing balls to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 7-8 min or until the potatoes are done</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are done, drain them in a colander, shake them until they're fluffy and reserve the pot for later

Carefully add the potatoes to the tray with the hot oil, turn them until they're fully coated in the oil and season with a pinch of salt

Transfer the vegetable tray to the bottom shelf of the oven, return the potatoes to the top shelf and cook for an initial 30 min or until the potatoes are starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle

Dissolve the remaining veg stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the Henderson's Relish and Marmite

Return the pot to a medium-low heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, and once warm add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Gradually add the stock to the pan and cook for 10-15 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice the Brussels sprouts into thirds

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced sprouts to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 10 min stirring frequently or until starting to caramelise

Combine the wholegrain mustard and agave in a bowl – this is your sweet mustard glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes and vegetables have had 30 min, add the meat-free chicken bites to the potato tray

Drizzle the sweet mustard glaze over the carrots and parsnips and return them to the oven with the potatoes for 10 min further or until the meat-free chicken has warmed through

Meanwhile, add the pine nuts to the sprouts and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Warm up the gravy over a low heat

Serve meat-free chicken with the stuffing balls, roast potatoes, sweet mustard veg and pine nut sprouts to the side

Add a dollop of cranberry sauce to the side and drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
