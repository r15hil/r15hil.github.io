<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your root veg fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add a pinch of salt to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiling water and stir until the salt has dissolved

Add your red wine vinegar and your dried cranberries and set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled cranberries

Cut a piece of tin foil, then trim and add your green beans to the middle with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and scrunch the edges together to form a sealed parcel

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add half of your chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and a knob of butter

Add your dried sage and panko breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up – this is your sage stuffing mix

Add the stuffing mix to one side of a baking paper-lined tray and push it out until approx. the thickness of a pound coin

Add the green bean parcel[s] to the other side of the tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the stuffing is golden and crisp

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add your chicken breast strips and cook for 3-4 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, dissolve the remaining chicken stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Once the chicken is browned, add 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> [4 tsp] </span>flour and mix well until it's coated the chicken

Reduce the heat to low and add the chicken stock

Cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has started to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Once the root veg fries are golden and crispy, push them into 1 pile per person and top with the torn mozzarella

Return the tray to the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your festive fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, cut the sage stuffing into small, bite-sized pieces and drain the quick-pickled cranberries

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the shredded chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Tip: If the gravy hasn't thickened, increase the heat to high and cook for a few minutes further!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load up the festive fries with the pulled chicken, sage stuffing pieces and quick-pickled cranberries

Serve the green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
