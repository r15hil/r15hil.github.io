<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half of your red Thai curry paste and the juice of half your lime[s] (save the rest for later!) and cook for 30 secs

Add your basa fillet[s] to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through, then transfer to a clean plate and set aside until later (reserve the pan!) – this is your zingy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, add your soy sauce to a bowl along with your toasted sesame oil, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining red Thai curry paste and juice of the remaining lime

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli sauce

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped spring onion, halved green beans and half your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 30 secs further</p><br><br>

<p>Add the lime & chilli sauce and cook for 1 min until the green beans have softened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your lime & chilli noodles with the zingy basa over the top

Tear over your coriander leaves and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
