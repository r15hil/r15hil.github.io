<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add the mini garlic & coriander naans and flaked almonds to a baking tray and put in the oven for 6 min or until the naans are warmed through and the almonds are lightly toasted

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min or until the squash cubes are fork-tender

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Once hot, add the drained chickpeas to the pan with the mild curry paste and cook for 1-2 min

Meanwhile, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has reduced slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has reduced, stir the cooked butternut squash through the sauce – this is your chickpea & butternut squash korma</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

Pick the coriander leaves from their stalks, discard the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set the warmed rice, chickpea & butternut squash korma and warmed mini garlic & coriander naans in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds and coriander leaves and let everyone dig in!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
