<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, drain and rinse your black beans and sweetcorn

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onion has started to soften, increase the heat to medium-high and add the drained black beans & sweetcorn to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until the corn is charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the veg is cooking, dice your tomato[es] finely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the diced red onion, diced tomato, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and chopped coriander in a bowl

Add the juice of half your lime[s], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar, then stir it all together – this is your fiery salsa

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the corn is charred, add your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the vegetable stock and cook for 2-3 min or until it's reduced

Once done, crush some of the beans with a masher and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your plant-based black bean & corn</p><br><br>
