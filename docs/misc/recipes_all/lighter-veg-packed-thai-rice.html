<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then cut each half, lengthways again, into 3 wedges and score the aubergine flesh in a criss-cross pattern

Add the aubergine wedges to a tray and spread over half of the Thai red curry paste so that they're evenly coated

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until cooked and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice has 5 min remaining, add the chopped baby corn and halved sugar snaps and continue to cook, covered, until everything is cooked and tender

Once done, squeeze in the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime – this is your veg-packed Thai rice

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the veg-packed Thai rice topped with the roasted aubergine wedges

Garnish with the chopped peanuts, chopped herbs and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
