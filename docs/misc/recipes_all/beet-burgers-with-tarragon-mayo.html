<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges


Add the wedges to a baking tray skin-side down (to prevent sticking) with a drizzle of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper


Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and grate the beetroot into a sieve (over a bowl), then press and squeeze to release any excess juice (you'll use this later!)


Season the grated beetroot generously with salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1-2 tbsp olive oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the sliced&nbsp;onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min until the onion has softened slightly


Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the reserved beetroot juice and cook for a further 5 min or until caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the apple cider vinegar, mayonnaise and the remaining chopped&nbsp;tarragon with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;- this is your&nbsp;herby mayo


Season lightly with salt and pepper


Transfer the cooked, caramelised onions to a plate, reserving the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Place the ciabatta in the oven for 6-8 min or until hot and crusty


Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 2-3 tbsp olive oil


Once&nbsp;hot, add the beetroot burgers and cook for 4 min on each side or until lightly caramelised and hot through


Tip: try not to fiddle with them in the pan, so they hold together!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble the burgers with some caramelised onion and a little herby&nbsp;mayo on top


Serve with the potato wedges and the remaining herby mayo to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
