<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a non-stick baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a small pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your cider vinegar to a plate with a small pinch of salt and sugar and a good grind of black pepper – this is your quick-pickling liquid

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways

Add 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>cucumber quarter per person (you'll use the rest later!) to the quick-pickling liquid and set aside – these are your 'gherkins'

Tip: Turn the cucumber every now and then to make sure they pickle evenly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a small pinch of salt and sugar and a splash of cold water

Cook the onions for 6-7 min or until they have softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your meat-free hot dog sausage[s] to a baking tray (or two!), use tin foil to avoid mess

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the sausage[s] are golden and cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dice the remaining cucumber finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add the diced cucumber to a pot over a medium heat with a knob of butter and small pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-7 min or until softened

Once softened, pour the pickling liquid from the 'gherkins' into the pot, add the sliced spring onion and cook for a further 2-3 min or until all the liquid has been absorbed – this is your cucumber relish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onions have softened, stir in 1/3 of your tomato ketchup (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until sticky – these are your New York-style sweet onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s]

Once the fries are done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push them into 1 pile per person, then top each pile with the grated cheese

Add the cut hot dog bun to the other side of the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted and the hot dog bun[s] are warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the hot dog bun with a meat-free hot dog, then top with the New York-style sweet onions and cucumber relish

Drizzle over your mustard ketchup and the remaining tomato ketchup, then top with your crispy onions

Serve the cheesy fries and 'gherkins' to the side with any remaining mustard ketchup

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
