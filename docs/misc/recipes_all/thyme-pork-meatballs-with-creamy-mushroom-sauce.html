<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle then cut your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with half your dried thyme, half your chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined, then shape into 6 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a little knob of butter over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are browned, transfer them to a clean plate and set aside (these will finish cooking in the sauce later!)

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and sliced mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Increase the heat to medium-high and return the meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Once everything is almost ready, return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the thyme pork meatballs with creamy mushroom sauce over the mashed potatoes
