<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped tomatoes, half of your roasted garlic paste (save the rest for later) and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold water

Season with salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has started to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with salt and pepper

Gently add the basa into the pan and cook, covered for 5 min, or until the basa is cooked through – this is your tomato & harissa smoked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the potatoes to a low heat with a generous knob of butter and the remaining roasted garlic paste

Crumble in half your feta (save the rest for garnish!)

Mash until smooth – this is your roast garlic feta mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato & harissa smoked basa with the roast garlic feta mash to the side

Crumble over the remaining feta

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
