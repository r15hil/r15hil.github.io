<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and slice half your red onion[s] very finely

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your beef mince, panko breadcrumbs, diced onion, chopped garlic, chopped parsley, dried oregano and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your beef mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide the beef mixture into 3 kebabs per person and roll into small sausage shapes – these are your Cypriot-style beef mince kebabs

Lightly oil a baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil and add the Cypriot-style beef mince kebabs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the kebabs are cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

Dice your tomato[es]

Roughly tear the remaining parsley</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this are your chilli pitta[s]</p><br><br>

Add your natural yoghurt with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp] </span>olive oil, the juice of half your lemon[s], half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and cut the chilli pitta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cypriot-style beef mince kebabs with the sumac salad and chilli pitta to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining ground sumac and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
