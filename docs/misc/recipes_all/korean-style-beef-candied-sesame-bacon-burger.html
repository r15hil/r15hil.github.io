<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are in the oven, slice your tomato[es] into 1 round per person

Roughly chop the remaining tomato

Add the tomato round[s] and chopped tomato to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled tomato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely grate your garlic and ginger

Add your beef mince to a bowl with the grated garlic and ginger and season with a generous pinch of salt

Using clean hands, give everything a good mix up until fully combined, then roll the mince into 1 meatball per person and press down with your hands to form a patty – this is your beef patty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your smoked streaky bacon to one side of a baking paper-lined tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until beginning to crisp up

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear into rough, bite-sized pieces

Wash, then remove 1 leaf from the lettuce per person, pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside, shred the remaining lettuce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, add the beef patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min (cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!)

Reduce the heat to medium-high, then flip and top the patty[ies] with most of your gochujang paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and the torn mozzarella then cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the patty is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the cheese has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once crispy, remove the bacon from the oven, pour your honey all over, then sprinkle half your toasted sesame seeds (save the rest for garnish!) on top – this is your candied sesame bacon

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add, cut side up, to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the brioche is toasted and the bacon has started to caramelise

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Separate the quick-pickled tomato round[s] (save it for the burger!) from the quick-pickled chopped tomatoes and set aside

Drain away 2/3 of the pickling liquid and add the remaining gochujang paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and half of your mayo (save the rest for later!)

Add the shredded lettuce and give everything a good mix up – this is your tangy tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread each toasted brioche half with the remaining mayo, then sandwich with a lettuce leaf, cheesy gochujang patty, candied sesame bacon, and a quick-pickled tomato round – this is your Korean-style beef & candied sesame bacon burger

Serve the tangy tomato salad and chips to the side, sprinkling the remaining toasted sesame seeds all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
