<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the lime zest and mayo with a pinch of sugar and a squeeze of lime juice (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) and stir it all together

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your zesty mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and shredded lettuce to your zesty mayo and toss together – this is your zesty slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your basa fillet[s] into thin strips and return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your sliced basa with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until lightly golden

Once lightly golden, add your red Thai curry paste and cook for a further 2 min or the paste is fragrant and the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is nearly ready, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the remaining lime into wedges

To assemble, lay a lettuce leaf on the bottom of each warmed tortilla

Divide the zesty slaw between the tortillas and top with the cooked basa

Squeeze over your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and garnish with the toasted coconut flakes and lime wedges – these are your red Thai fish tacos

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
