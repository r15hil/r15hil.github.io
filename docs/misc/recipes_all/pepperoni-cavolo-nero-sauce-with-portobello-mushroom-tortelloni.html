<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Slice your pepperoni into thin strips

Once hot, add the pepperoni strips and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Wash, then chop your cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepperoni has started to brown, add the chopped cavolo nero and sliced garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the cavolo nero has wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained tortelloni to the pan with a knob of butter and gently stir it all together until the pasta is coated in sauce – this is your pepperoni & cavolo nero sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pepperoni & cavolo nero sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind on black pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
