<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and let it air and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 100ml<span class="text-danger"> </span><span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the chicken has browned, add the harissa stock to the pan

Cook, covered, for a further 12-15 min, turning the chicken halfway, until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the stock has reduced</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your wholemeal pitta[s] into rough bite-sized triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil, a pinch of salt and your ground sumac

Give it a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crunchy pitta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Give it a good mix up until it's smooth – this is your lemony dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the sauce – this is your shredded harissa chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce to a bowl with the grated carrot, sliced cucumber, tomato wedges, crunchy pitta and most of the chopped mint and dill (save some for garnish!)

Add 1/2 tbsp [3/4 tbsp] [1 tbsp] olive oil and the juice from the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your crunchy pitta salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Combine the salad with the lemony dressing and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your crunchy pitta salad

Serve the shredded harissa free range chicken over the crunchy pitta salad

Drizzle with the lemony dressing and garnish with the remaining chopped mint and dill

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
