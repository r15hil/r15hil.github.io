<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop half your brown onion[s] into wedges, then finely slice the remaining brown onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes and onion wedges to one side of the baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle over your ground turmeric, black mustard seeds and half of your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – these are your Bombay potatoes

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add half your garam masala (save the rest for later!) to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to the plate and turn several times until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After the Bombay potatoes have had an initial 10-12 min, add the coated free range chicken to the other side of the tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 18-20 min, or until the potatoes are crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your curried free range chicken & Bombay potato tray bake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile wash then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Line a separate baking tray with a large piece of tin foil

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle of the foil with a pinch of salt, a knob of butter and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the greens are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion has started to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, remaining curry powder and garam masala to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your masala sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried free range chicken & Bombay potato tray bake with the spring greens to the side

Spoon the masala sauce over the chicken and drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
