<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle, then heat a separate large, wide-based pot over a medium heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Once melted, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once the soup base has thickened, add the chopped smoked basa, cooked potatoes and your double cream and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add a very generous grind of pepper and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once the fish is cooked through, add half the chopped parsley (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your smoked basa & leek cullen skink</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa & leek cullen skink in a bowl and sprinkle over your smoked sea salt and the remaining chopped parsley

Serve the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
