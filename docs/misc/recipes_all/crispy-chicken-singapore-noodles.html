<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, push the chicken and vegetables to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg

Add the drained noodles with your soy sauce, a splash of reserved starchy noodle water and a knob of butter and give everything a good mix up or until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – this is your Singapore-style chicken noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Singapore-style chicken noodles topped with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
