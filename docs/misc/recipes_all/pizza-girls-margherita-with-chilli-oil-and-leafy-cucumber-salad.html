<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the grated garlic, dried oregano and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Cut your cucumber into batons

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Top with the torn mozzarella</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your extra easy margherita</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the pizza is cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat for 1-2 min or until very hot

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small heatproof bowl with a generous pinch of salt

Carefully pour the heated oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your chilli oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your salad and cucumber batons in a bowl with the balsamic dressing

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Set aside half of the cucumber batons for serving!</span>

Give everything a good mix up – this is your leafy cucumber salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the extra easy margherita and drizzle over the chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), then tear over your basil

Serve with the leafy cucumber salad to the side

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the chilli oil and basil and serve the reserved cucumber batons to the side!</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
