<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the pepper strips, onion wedges and chopped tomatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and beginning to colour – these are your roasted vegetables</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are in the oven, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add your orzo and tomato paste and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the orzo is tender with a slight bite

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to prevent it from sticking!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the orzo is cooked, add the roasted vegetables to the pan with your red wine vinegar

Add the chopped basil and stir it all together – this is your roasted red pepper orzo

Tip: Add a splash of water if your orzo is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted red pepper orzo in a bowl

Crumble your goats' cheese all over the top

Garnish with the reserved basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil, then season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
