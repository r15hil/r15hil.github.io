<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish is inspired by the tasty Chinese staple, mapo tofu, in which tofu is cooked in a spicy and umami-packed sauce. Wholewheat noodles are tossed in toasted sesame oil giving the dish a rich flavour, which works really well with the crunchy broccoli and red pepper. (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).</p>
