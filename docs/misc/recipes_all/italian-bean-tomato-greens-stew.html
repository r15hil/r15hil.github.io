<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are browning, wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the drained cannellini beans and sliced spring greens with the veg stock and a small pinch of salt

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potato is fork-tender, tear half your ciabatta[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces (you'll use the rest later!)

Add the torn ciabatta to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook, uncovered, for a further 5 min or until the bread is fully soaked into the sauce

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and stir through most of your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the remaining ciabatta[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half

Add the sliced ciabatta to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once warmed through, spread a knob of butter over the toasted ciabatta, then cut each half into triangles – this is your ciabatta toast</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Italian-style bean, tomato & greens stew with the ciabatta toast on the side

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
