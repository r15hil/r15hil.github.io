<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Season generously with salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until they're crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel then grate the carrots into a large mixing bowl

Add the rice vinegar and a large drizzle of olive oil, season with salt and pepper, mix well and set aside – this is your carrot slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice the halloumi in half lengthways (where the natural crease forms)

Add 500ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>boiled water to a wide pot and return to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, carefully add the halloumi slices and boil for 5-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty

While the ciabattas are toasting, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the harissa paste and mayo in a small bowl for serving – this is your harissa mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, drain and pat the halloumi slices dry with kitchen paper

Using a rolling pin, flatten and roll out each piece into a size similar to the ciabatta – these are your halloumi steaks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potato wedges are nearly cooked, heat a dry, non-stick pan over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the halloumi steaks

Cook on each side for 1-2 min or until golden</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread each ciabatta base with the harissa mayo, then layer with the halloumi steaks, carrot slaw, and another dollop of harissa mayo

Top with the ciabatta lid

Serve with the potato wedges and any remaining carrot slaw and harissa mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
