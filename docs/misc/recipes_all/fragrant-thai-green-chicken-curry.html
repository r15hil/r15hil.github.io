<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your lemongrass, basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min

Once the shallot has softened, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 5-7 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your ginger and garlic

Slice your red chilli[es] in half and scrape the seeds out with a spoon

Chop your coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Add the ginger, garlic, half of the chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your Thai green curry paste to the pan with the chicken and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Meanwhile, dissolve your chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water, add your fish sauce with your lime leaf[ves], the juice of half your lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your fragrant stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped green beans and fragrant stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened - this is your Thai green chicken thigh curry

Tip: Add an extra splash of water if the sauce thickens too quickly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Slice the remaining chilli finely

Discard the lime leaf[ves] and lemongrass</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai green chicken thigh curry with the lemongrass rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
