<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Slice your bread roll[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the bread roll is toasting, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan with the sliced courgette, tomato wedges and your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min</p><br><br>

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your jumbo prawn saganaki

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>
