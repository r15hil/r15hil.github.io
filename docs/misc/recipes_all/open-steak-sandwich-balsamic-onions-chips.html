<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-15 min or until softened and caramelised

While the onions are cooking, strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Add the chopped rosemary and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and set aside for later – this is your rosemary salt

Combine your wholegrain mustard (not a big fan of mustard? Go easy!) and mayo in a separate bowl, stir it all together and set aside for later – this is your mustard mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onions are caramelised, add your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[</span>2 tbsp]</span> sugar to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until sticky

Once done, remove the pan from the heat, cover with a lid to keep warm, and set aside for later – these are your balsamic onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and salad to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and gently mix together – this is your salad

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Transfer the cooked steak[s] to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest (save the pan for the next step!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the steak[s] is cooking, cut your ciabatta[s] in half

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the ciabatta halves and cook for 1 min on each side, or until golden brown and toasted (the ciabatta will soak up all the juices from the steak for extra flavour!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak[s] finely

Divide the balsamic onions between the toasted ciabatta halves

Top with the sliced steak and drizzle over the mustard mayo – this is your open steak sandwich with balsamic onions

Serve the chips and salad to the side and sprinkle the rosemary salt all over the chips

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
