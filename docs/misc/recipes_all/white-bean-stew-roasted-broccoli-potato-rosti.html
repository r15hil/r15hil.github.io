<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Peel and grate the potatoes


Add the grated potato to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can


Add the squeezed potato to a bowl with 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> of salt and a pinch of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a sheet of non-stick baking paper to a baking tray (or two!) and drizzle with vegetable oil


Add the grated potato to one side of the baking paper and shape into a rectangle (press it down hard to make it as thin as possible!)


Drizzle with vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden brown and crispy – this is your potato rosti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat</span>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the rosti has had 10-12 min, add the Tenderstem broccoli to the other side of the tray


Season with a pinch of salt, drizzle with olive oil and return the tray to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the broccoli is golden and tender and the rosti is cooked through</p><br><br>

Drain and rinse the butter beans 


Add the tomato paste to the softened onion and cook for 1 min further


Add the chopped tomatoes with the red wine vinegar and reduce the heat to low


Cook, covered, for 5-6 min further or until the tomatoes have broken down to create a sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, add the baby leaf spinach and drained butter beans to the pan with a pinch of pepper and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your white bean stew


Once the rosti is done, transfer it to a board and cut in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted broccoli over the rosti halves 


Spoon over the white bean stew


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
