<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper, then slice the tofu into 2 pieces per person

Add the sliced tofu to a bowl with your soy sauce and wholegrain mustard

Give everything a good mix up, then set aside for later – this is your mustard marinated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the diced shallot to a large bowl with the juice of half the lemon wedges and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for 1-2 min

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to the mustard marinated tofu with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with your ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt – these are your smoky breadcrumbs

Press the mustard marinated tofu into the smoky breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your smoky breaded tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the smoky breaded tofu and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until browned – this is your tofu schnitzel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, add the trimmed green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once the potatoes are done, add the crispy potatoes and chopped chives to the quick-pickled shallot mayo and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled potato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tofu schnitzel with the quick-pickled potato salad and cooked green beans to the side

Garnish with a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
