<p><strong>Description:</strong> There are so many different curries in Malaysia, all eaten on a daily basis. This particular version lets the spices take centre stage.  Like any good curry, it is a blend of spices, tamarind, and not too overpowering creamy coconut. I like to serve this slightly thicker than is tradition, so that the sauce gives an extra kick.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the rice, 350ml<span class="text-danger"> (700ml)</span> water and salt (optional) to a pot with a lid over a high heat and bring to the boil


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water until fully submerged (this softens the naturally hard cream)


Blitz the onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor (or with a hand blender) until fine


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> (4 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil


&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the blitzed ingredients and cook until softened and lightly golden brown (approx. 3-4 min), then add the star anise, cinnamon and bay leaves and cook for a further 30 seconds&nbsp;


Meanwhile, mix the curry powder with 100ml <span class="text-danger">(200ml)</span> water in a bowl


Tip: Diluting the curry powder prevents it from clumping up whilst frying!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the curry powder mixture, tamarind paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> salt (fine sea salt preferably) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, stirring often to prevent sticking to the bottom</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chicken, 100ml <span class="text-danger">(200ml)</span> boiled water and the softened coconut cream and reduce the heat to low


Cook until the chicken is cooked through (approx. 7-10 min) and the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Fluff the cooked rice with a fork


<span class="text-highlight">Once the chicken is cooked, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> sugar and taste, you may want to add more if needed</span>


Tip: The sugar helps temper the sourness from the tamarind!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Discard the bay leaves and star anise


Stir most of the coriander through the rice, scoop the curry out into bowls and serve with rice


<span class="text-highlight">Garnish with the remaining coriander and enjoy!</span></p><br><br>
