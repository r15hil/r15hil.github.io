<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the onion wedges, garlic, pepper strips and cherry tomatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the vegetables have softened – this is your softened veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your pistachio nuts finely

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped pistachio nuts and cook for an initial 1-2 min or until beginning to toast

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once lightly toasted, add your panko breadcrumbs to the pan with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Cook for 3-4 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden

Once golden, add your dried basil, stir it all together and remove from the heat – this is your pistachio crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the linguine with a drizzle of olive oil and cook for 6-8 min or until almost cooked, then drain, reserving the pot and a cup of starchy pasta water

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will finish cooking in the sauce later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the softened veg to a food processor with your creamy single soy, balsamic sun-dried tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your creamy tomato & red pepper sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained linguine to the pot and add the creamy tomato & red pepper sauce, a good grind of pepper and a splash of starchy pasta water

Stir it all together and cook for a final 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pasta is fully coated – this is your creamy tomato & red pepper linguine

Wash your rocket then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato & red pepper linguine in bowls topped with the pistachio crumb

Garnish with the rocket, a small drizzle of olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
