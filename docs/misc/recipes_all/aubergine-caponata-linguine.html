<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put in the oven for 16-18 min or until the aubergine is golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Chop the sultanas roughly

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and add the chopped sultanas – this is your sultana stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper and red wine vinegar to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften

Whilst softening, chop the olives, capers and basil roughly

Reboil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has slightly softened, add the chopped tomatoes and sultana stock and give everything a good mix up

Add the chopped olives, capers, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has started to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Grate the cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the roasted aubergine to the pan with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and mix everything together – this is your aubergine caponata

Tip: Add more of the starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the aubergine caponata over the linguine and sprinkle over the grated cheddar cheese

Garnish with the remaining basil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
