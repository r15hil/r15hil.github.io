<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut your hake fillet[s] into 4 pieces per person

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml]</span> cold water and your ground turmeric and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your turmeric rice</p><br><br>

Add your white wine vinegar, nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned – this is your curried crispy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the chopped mint and coriander to the turmeric rice and stir it all together – this is your herby turmeric rice

Serve your curried crispy hake on top of the herby turmeric rice and the quick-pickled red cabbage to the side

Dollop the mango yoghurt over everything

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
