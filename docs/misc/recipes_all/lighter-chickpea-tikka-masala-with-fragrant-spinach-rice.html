Heat a dry large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a bowl and reserve the pan

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold water until it's cool, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chickpea tikka masala with the spinach rice to the side
