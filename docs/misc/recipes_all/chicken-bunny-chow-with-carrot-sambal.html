<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potato is fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh, cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Once browned, add the diced onion and cook for a further 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add your ginger & garlic paste, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> </span>flour, then cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, chicken stock mix, garam masala and steamed potato

Cook for 6-8 min or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your chicken curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the grated carrot, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce in a large bowl with the chopped coriander and your white wine vinegar

Season with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your carrot & coriander salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the top off your ciabatta[s] and hollow out the middle with a spoon

Tip: Save the removed middle to make breadcrumbs for another recipe!

Place the hollowed ciabatta base[s] and ciabatta lid[s] on a baking tray and put in the oven for 5 min or until hot and toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken curry inside the toasted ciabatta base, top with the toasted ciabatta lid and serve the carrot & coriander salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
