Peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic and ginger

Slice half of the red chilli into rounds and roughly chop the remaining chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the chopped ginger, garlic, lemongrass and chopped red chilli (save the rounds for garnish!) to a food processor with the ground turmeric, soy sauce, half the peanuts and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Blitz to a rough paste – this is your nutty lemongrass paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the nutty lemongrass paste  to the pan and cook for 3-4 mins until fragrant

Meanwhile, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly, then dissolve it in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the haddock bites and coconut stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min until the fish is cooked through

While the fish is cooking, rip the remaining leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Push the rice noodles to one side of the pan and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the other side

Stir the egg<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with a wooden spoon to break the yolk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then gently mix it through the rice noodles – this is your nutty lemongrass & haddock stir-fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Lay a spring green leaf on the base of each bowl

Top with the nutty lemongrass & haddock stir-fry, remaining peanuts and chilli rounds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
