<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop into thin matchsticks

Slice your cucumber[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs and season them with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3 min on both sides or until lightly browned

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped garlic, tamari soy sauce, mirin, honey and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>boiled water

Cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened and is sticky in consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is thickening, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Slice your mangetout in half lengthways

Add the sliced mangetout to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mix the pulled chicken into the pan juices – this is your pulled chicken teriyaki

Drain the quick-pickled vegetables through a sieve

Drain the mangetout</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pulled chicken teriyaki over the cooked rice, with the grated carrot, quick-pickled vegetables and mangetout to the side

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
