<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] into batons

Peel and cut your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the carrot batons, parsnip batons and onion petals to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with your ground coriander, a generous pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the vegetables are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a medium-sized pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden then transfer to a chopping board, reserve the pot

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Rinse the reserved pot with cold water and add your spelt with plenty of boiling water, then add your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 20 min or until tender (it will still have a slight bite once cooked)

Once cooked, drain and rinse the cooked spelt under cold running water until the spelt has cooled slightly and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half (save the zest for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables are tender, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top with your honey

Give everything a good mix up then return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until caramelised – these are your honey roasted roots</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of half your zested lemon[s] in a bowl with your Dijon mustard, a drizzle of olive oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon mustard dressing

Add the cooked spelt, salad, diced apricots, most of the chopped parsley and most of your toasted almonds (save some for garnish!) to the bowl with the dressing

Mix everything together until fully combined – these are your spelt grains</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Serve the spelt grains topped with the honey roasted roots and crumble over your goats’ cheese

Sprinkle over the remaining toasted almonds, chopped parsley and lemon zest and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
