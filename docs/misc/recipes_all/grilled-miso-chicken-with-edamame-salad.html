<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the white long grain rice with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 12-15 min, then remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Add half the chopped ginger to a large bowl with the miso paste, 1/3 of the toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Stir it all together until smooth – this is your miso marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the diced chicken breast to the miso marinade and mix it all together until fully coated – this is your coated chicken

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the coated chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through and starting to char (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, cut the cucumber in half lengthways (scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard) then dice roughly

Add the edamame beans to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them, then run under cold water until cool

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> as finely as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining chopped ginger with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, remaining sesame oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your sesame ginger dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the diced cucumber, refreshed edamame beans and sliced shallot to the bowl with the sesame ginger dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your edamame salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the edamame salad over the cooked rice and drizzle over any remaining sesame ginger dressing

Top with the grilled miso chicken and sprinkle over the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
