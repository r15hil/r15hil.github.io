Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your minted pea soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Sandwich the loaded ciabatta base and ciabatta lid together and cut in half diagonally – this is your cheese & mushroom toastie

Serve the minted pea soup in bowls with the cheese & mushroom toastie to the side

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil
