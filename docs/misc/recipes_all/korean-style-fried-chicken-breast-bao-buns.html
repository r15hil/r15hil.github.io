<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic, tomato ketchup, honey and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Korean-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and your soy sauce and mix it all together

Add your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the chicken is coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix, rice vinegar and toasted sesame seeds to a large bowl with a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled sesame slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is crispy and cooked through, add 3/4 of the Korean-style sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your Korean-style fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your mayo to the remaining Korean-style sauce – this is your spicy mayo

Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with a little spicy mayo, the Korean-style fried chicken and top with some of the quick-pickled sesame slaw and sliced spring onion – these are your Korean-style fried chicken bao buns</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Korean-style fried chicken bao buns with the chips, remaining quick-pickled sesame slaw and remaining spicy mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
