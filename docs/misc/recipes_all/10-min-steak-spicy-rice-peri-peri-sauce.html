<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg and take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary, and if you like your steak well-done, it may take you a little longer than 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce and tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of the cooked white long grain rice, making sure to separate the grains

Once fragrant, add the cooked white long grain rice with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your spicy rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your tomato ketchup, chipotle paste, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), dried oregano and the juice of half your lemon[s] in a bowl (you'll use the rest later!)

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your peri peri sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of the remaining lemon with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a separate large bowl

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the bowl and give it a good mix up until evenly coated – this is your zingy salad

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced rump steak with the spicy rice, zingy salad and peri peri sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
