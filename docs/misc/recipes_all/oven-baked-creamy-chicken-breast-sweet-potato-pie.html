<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and your dried thyme and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped sweet potato, chicken stock mix, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potato is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once everything's been in the oven for 12 min, dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour

Roll out your puff pastry to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and add to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your pie lid</p><br><br>
