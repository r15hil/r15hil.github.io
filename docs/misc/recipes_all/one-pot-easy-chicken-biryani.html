<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice is not cooked or the mixture is a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your chicken biryani

Serve the chicken biryani with a dollop of your natural yoghurt over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
