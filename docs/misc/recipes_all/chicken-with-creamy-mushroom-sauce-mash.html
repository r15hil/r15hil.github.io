<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the soft cheese in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Once softened, add the soy sauce and creamy stock to the mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency – this is your creamy mushroom sauce</p><br><br>

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the cooked chicken and serve it on top of the creamy mushroom sauce, with the mashed potato and Chantenay carrots to the side
