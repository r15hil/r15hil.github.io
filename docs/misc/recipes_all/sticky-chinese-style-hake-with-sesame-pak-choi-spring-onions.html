<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, wash, then trim the base from your pak choi, then separate the individual leaves and discard the base

Trim your spring onion[s], then cut each spring onion into thirds

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once hot, add your hake fillet[s] and cook for an initial 3-4 min on one side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves, spring onion thirds and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until both have softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and toasted sesame oil and cook for 1 min further – this is your sesame pak choi & spring onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After 3-4 min turn the hake fillet[s] and add the sticky sauce to the pan

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the hake is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a sticky consistency – these are your sticky Chinese-style hake fillet[s]

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your black sesame seeds to the basmati rice and fluff with a fork – this is your sesame rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky Chinese-style hake fillet[s] over the sesame rice and drizzle with any remaining sticky sauce

Serve the sesame pak choi & spring onions to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
