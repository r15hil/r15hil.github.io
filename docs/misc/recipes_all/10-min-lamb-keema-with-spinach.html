<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, lets get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and sprinkle in your beef stock mix

Cook for 4-5 min or until the lamb is browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the spices are cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Add the rice to the pan with a small splash of water and give everything a good mix up

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the spinach to the pan with a small splash of water and cook, covered, for 2 min or until the spinach has wilted and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your lamb thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

Once done, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your lamb keema</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lamb keema topped with a dollop of your natural yoghurt

Garnish with the chopped herbs and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
