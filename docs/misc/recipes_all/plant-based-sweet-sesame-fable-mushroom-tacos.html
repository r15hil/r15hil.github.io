<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Add your soy sauce to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, agave and a grind of pepper and mix to combine – this is your sweet sesame sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sliced onion to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min, stirring often or until golden and crispy then transfer to a small bowl and set aside until serving – these are your crispy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to a clean board and shred apart using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the Fable pulled mushrooms to the pan over a high heat and add the sweet sesame sauce (reserve the bowl for later!) and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – these are your sweet sesame Fable mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain the sliced onion in a sieve and under cold running water until cooled

Return them to the bowl and combine with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for later – these are your quick-pickled onions

Wash, then shred your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]</p><br><br>
