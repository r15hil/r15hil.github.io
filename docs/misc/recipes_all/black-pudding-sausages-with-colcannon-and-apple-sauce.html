<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the chopped apple to a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 80ml <span class="text-purple">[105ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook, covered, over a medium heat for 10-12 min or until the apple has softened

Once done, transfer the softened apple to a bowl with a knob of butter (reserve the pan) and mash until smooth – this is your apple sauce</p><br><br>
