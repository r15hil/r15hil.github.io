<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the beef is in the oven, add your dried yeast to a jug with 20ml <span class="text-purple">[30ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[40ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix it all together, then set aside for 5-8 min for the yeast to develop

Combine 70g <span class="text-purple">[100g] </span><span class="text-danger">[140g]</span> flour with a pinch of salt and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>butter and use your fingers to mix it together to form a crumb (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your buttery crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the yeast to the buttery crumb with your dried thyme and gently mix with a plastic spatula, then your hands until a sticky dough ball has formed (add a little extra flour if it's looking too sticky!)

Cover with a tea towel and set aside to rise for 20 min – this is your dumpling mixture

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the dish has had 30 min, divide the dumpling mixture into 3 small balls per person – these are your homemade thyme dumplings

Remove the dish from the oven and top with the homemade thyme dumplings

Return the dish to the oven, covered, for a final 35 min – this is your beef chuck stew with homemade thyme dumplings

Reboil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a small knob of butter and a splash of milk, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mashed potato in bowls with the beef chuck stew with homemade thyme dumplings to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
