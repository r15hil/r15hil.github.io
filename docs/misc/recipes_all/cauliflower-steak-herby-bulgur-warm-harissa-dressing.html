<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your cauliflower[s] into 1-inch steaks per person (use the middle part as it’s larger!)

Tip: Save any extra florets for another recipe!

Add the cauliflower steaks to a baking tray, then brush over 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, sprinkle over your ras el hanout, season with a pinch of salt and put in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the cauliflower is cooking, boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Top, tail then slice your courgette[s] into rounds

Add the pepper strips and courgette rounds to a separate tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up, then set them aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your bulgur wheat and diced apricots to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the cauliflower steaks have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and turn the steaks over

Return the cauliflower steaks to the oven along with the pepper strips and courgette rounds and cook for a further 15-20 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – these are your spiced cauliflower steaks & roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden, then transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped parsley and mint (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked bulgur and give it a good mix – this is your herby bulgur

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a low heat

Once warm, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the pan and mix together

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your warm harissa dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced cauliflower steaks with the herby bulgur, roasted veg and shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the warm harissa dressing all over

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, a lemon wedge and the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
