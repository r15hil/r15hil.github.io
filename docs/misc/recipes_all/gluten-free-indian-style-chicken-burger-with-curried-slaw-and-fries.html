<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your paprika fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a bowl with your ground cumin, garam masala and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once browned, transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half

Wipe the reserved pan, then return it to a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving</p><br><br>

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your curried slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top your toasted brioche base with a dollop of mango mayo, the spiced chicken, a handful of curried slaw and the toasted brioche lid – this is your Indian-style chicken burger

Serve the paprika fries and remaining curried slaw to the side
