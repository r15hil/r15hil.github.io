<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the drained sweetcorn to the pan with your white long grain rice

Cook for 1 min further, stirring to coat the grains in all the spices</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine your natural yoghurt with half the chopped coriander (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your coriander yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, stir through the remaining chopped coriander with the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your kedgeree-style rice

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa over the kedgeree-style rice

Dollop over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
