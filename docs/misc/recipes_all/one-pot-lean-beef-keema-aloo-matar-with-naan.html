<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your lean beef mince to the dish, breaking it up into rough, large chunks and cook for 1-2 min or until very lightly browned all over

Once browned, stir in 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, tomato wedges, onion wedges and crushed garlic to the dish with a generous pinch of salt

Sprinkle in your curry powder, ground cumin and ground turmeric, then add your beef stock mix with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 25 min – this is your keema aloo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your natural yoghurt to a small bowl with your mint sauce

Season with a small pinch of salt and stir it all together, then put it in the fridge until serving – this is your mint yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the keema aloo has had an initial 25 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your blanched peas

Return the dish to the oven for a final 5 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one pot lean beef keema aloo matar

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and put the baking tray[s] in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is warm</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one pot lean beef keema aloo matar in a bowl with the warmed naan to the side

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt
