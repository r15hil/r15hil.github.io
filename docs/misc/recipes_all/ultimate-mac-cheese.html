<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the&nbsp;conchiglie&nbsp;to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the&nbsp;conchiglie&nbsp;for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the&nbsp;conchiglie, reserving 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> of the&nbsp;starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the&nbsp;streaky bacon&nbsp;into small, bite-size pieces


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat and once hot, add 2/3 of the chopped&nbsp;bacon (save the rest for later!)


Cook for 3-4 min or until crisped, then transfer to kitchen paper and set aside (keep the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the&nbsp;pan to a medium heat and once hot, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter


Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;flour&nbsp;and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms - this is your roux


Gradually whisk 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;milk&nbsp;into the roux and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains - this is your&nbsp;b&eacute;chamel sauce&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate the&nbsp;garlic&nbsp;into the&nbsp;b&eacute;chamel sauce&nbsp;and season with a generous pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and&nbsp;pepper&nbsp;


Once thickened, add the&nbsp;Italian hard cheese,&nbsp;cheddar,&nbsp;wholegrain mustard,&nbsp;crispy bacon and&nbsp;drained conchigle&nbsp;with a few splashes of&nbsp;starchy pasta water&nbsp;to loosen the mixture


Tip: you want your sauce to be quite loose as it will continue to thicken in the oven!</p><br><br>

Transfer the&nbsp;cheesy pasta&nbsp;to an oven-proof dish, then top with the ripped mozzarella, panko breadcrumbs&nbsp;and the remaining chopped bacon, drizzle with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until it's golden</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;- this is your&nbsp;balsamic dressing


Gently toss the&nbsp;baby leaf&nbsp;mixed&nbsp;salad with the slow roasted tomatoes&nbsp;and drizzle with the balsamic dressing when you're ready to serve


Enjoy!&nbsp;</p><br><br>
