<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into thin wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the wedges are in the oven, add the chicken breast portions to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side, then open them out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Season the butterflied chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and coat in the ground coriander

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned butterflied chicken and cook for 4 min on each side until golden, then turn the heat down to medium and cook for a further 3-4 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Chop 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> red onion into wedges

Dice the remaining red onion finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the wedges have had 15 min, add the red onion wedges to the tray and return to the oven for 10-15 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop the cherry tomatoes

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes, diced red onion, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the chopped coriander and the juice from 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime to a small bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, season with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salsa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the butterflied chicken over the guacamole with the potato and red onion wedges to the side

Dollop the zingy salsa over the wedges – these are your zingy salsa wedges

Garnish with the lime wedges
