<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and your vegetable stock mix with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has slightly thickened, add the chopped basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your basa asa wat

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
