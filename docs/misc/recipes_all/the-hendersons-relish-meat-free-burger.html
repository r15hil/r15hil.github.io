<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden and crispy – these are your black pepper chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a pot over a low heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 20 min, stirring frequently, or until halved in size and golden

Tip: Cook the onion over a really low heat so it doesn’t burn!

Once golden, add 3/4 of your Henderson's Relish (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min further or until dark and soft – this is your Henderson's caramelised onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is caramelising, combine the remaining Henderson's Relish and your mayo in a small bowl – this is your Henderson's mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the patty is cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top your patty[ies] with a cheese flavour slice

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheeze has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread the Henderson’s mayo onto the warmed brioche halves, then fill with the Henderson’s caramelised onion, a cheezy patty and some shredded lettuce – this is your Henderson’s Relish meat-free burger

Serve with the black pepper chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
