<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’


Return the shredded chicken to the pan with the chopped coriander stalks and give everything a good old mix up</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Build your own fajitas with the pepper &amp; onion, shredded chicken and natural yoghurt


Top them with the grated cheese and coriander leaves


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
