<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your shallot[s] in half

Top, tail and cut your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice on the diagonal

Crush your garlic clove open with the side of a knife, remove the skins and chop in half

Chop your waxy potatoes in half</p><br><br>

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the chopped rosemary and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden – these are your rosemary roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<p>Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 25-30 min or until the  the sauce has thickened – this is your Fable mushroom 'bourguignon'

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Discard the bay leaf[ves]

Serve the Fable mushroom 'bourguignon' in the middle of the table with the rosemary roast potatoes to the side
