<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your boneless lamb leg joint[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>out of the fridge, open the packet[s] and let them adjust to room temperature

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take a knob of butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften, then boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground turmeric, black mustard seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your Bombay potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Remove the string from the lamb leg joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper and rub the lamb with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then season with half your garam masala (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned lamb to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned on all sides, then set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Combine half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) with the knob of butter and a pinch of salt – this is your curried butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has slightly softened, add the crushed cardamom pods, chopped ginger & garlic, remaining garam masala and remaining curry powder and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock mix and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, stir it all together and bring to the boil

Once boiling, remove from the heat and stir through your natural yoghurt, then transfer the sauce to an oven-proof dish and top with the browned lamb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the dish in the oven for 8-9 min for rare, 10-12 min for medium-rare and 12-14 min for medium

Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board to rest for 3 min before slicing – this is your roast lamb

Give the sauce a good mix up – this is your rogan josh sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the lamb is resting, add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Add the refreshed peas to the curried butter and stir it all together – these are your spiced peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roast lamb over the rogan josh sauce with the Bombay potatoes and spiced peas to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
