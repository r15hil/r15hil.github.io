<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long-grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Dice your tomato[es]

Cut your half of your lime[s] in half

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the sliced spring onion, diced tomato, drained sweetcorn and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl

Squeeze over the juice of your lime and drizzle in 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Season generously with both salt and pepper – this is your corn salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Wash the lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your ground smoked paprika and ground coriander on a plate with a pinch of both salt and pepper – this is your spice mix

Add the chopped haddock to the spice mix and give everything a good mix up so that they're fully coated – these are your spiced haddock bites

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a high heat

Once hot, add your spiced haddock bites and cook for 3-4 min, turning once halfway (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily) – these are your blackened haddock bites

Tip: Don't be alarmed if the haddock bites look like they're burning, they will become 'blackened', which gives them the smoky, charred flavour you want</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, combine your mayo and chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with a drizzle of olive oil and set aside – this is your spicy mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the blackened haddock bites over the cooked rice with the corn salsa and shredded lettuce to the side

Garnish with the lime wedges and drizzle with the spicy mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
