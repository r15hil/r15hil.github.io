<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Once the bacon is crisp, add it to a plate lined with kitchen paper and set aside, reserving the pan and any remaining oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your avocado[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your cannellini beans

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add the drained cannellini beans along with half of your red chilli relish (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together and cook for 1-2 min until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the beans are cooking, add the remaining chilli relish to a bowl along with your cider vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your chilli relish dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the warmed cannellini beans to a bowl with the salad and half of the crispy bacon (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your crispy bacon & cannellini bean salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy bacon & cannellini bean salad with the sliced avocado over the top

Crumble over your feta and drizzle with the chilli relish dressing

Top with your pumpkin seeds and remaining crispy bacon

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
