<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Combine your chicken breast strips and ground cumin in a bowl with your dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve half your chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock and cook, covered, for a further 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return to the pot and stir through the remaining chicken stock mix with a grind of black pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!), then chop the zested lime[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped coriander with a drizzle of olive oil, the lime zest and the juice of half the lime[s] in a large bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coriander dressing

Drain your sweetcorn

Combine the drained sweetcorn and chopped tomato in the bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your corn salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the juice of the remaining lime and cook for 1 min

Remove the pan from the heat and shred the chicken apart, using two forks – this is your Peruvian-style chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Peruvian-style chicken with the bulgur wheat and corn salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
