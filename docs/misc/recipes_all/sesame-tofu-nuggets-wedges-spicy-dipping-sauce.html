<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cover the tofu nuggets in the flour and tap off the excess, then add them into the mayo mix until lightly coated and finally press them into the breadcrumb mix firmly to evenly coat all over

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your sesame tofu nuggets</p><br><br>

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]
