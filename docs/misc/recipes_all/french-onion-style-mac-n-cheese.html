<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion, sliced garlic and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> cold water

Add your thyme (chuck it in, stalks and all!) and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the onion has completely softened, stirring frequently</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the macaroni reserving 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[175ml]</span> [200ml]</span> starchy pasta water and set aside until later, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has completely softened, add your Marmite, vegetable stock mix, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>cold water

Cook, uncovered, for 4-5 min further or until caramelised

Tip: Watch them like a hawk and stir frequently to make sure they don't burn!

Once caramelised, discard the thyme stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, then add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> milk and the starchy pasta water into the roux, and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then stir through half the grated cheese (save the rest for later!) with your clotted cream – this is your cheese sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add most of the caramelised onion to the cheese sauce with the drained macaroni and stir everything together – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to an oven-proof dish and sprinkle over the remaining caramelised onion, panko breadcrumbs and remaining grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your French onion-style mac 'n' cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the mac 'n' cheese is cooking, combine your white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the French onion-style mac 'n' cheese with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
