<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the shredded red cabbage to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Layer the Cumberland sausages over the top of the cabbage and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is in the oven, wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice in half lengthways and chop into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sausages and red cabbage have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven

Add the chopped leek with a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper, then sprinkle over the rosemary leaves and half the thyme leaves (save the rest for later!)

Return the tray to the oven for a further 6-8 min or until everything is beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rip the ciabatta roll<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly into croutons

Add the croutons to a bowl with a knob of butter and the remaining thyme leaves

Mix everything together so that the croutons are evenly coated – these are your thyme croutons

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>boiled water with the green tomato chutney – this is your stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the thyme croutons to the tray

Return the tray to the oven for a final 8-10 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and everything is golden - this is your sausage, red cabbage & leek tray bake

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat and once hot, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Add the stock and whisk until combined and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage, red cabbage & leek tray bake in bowls and drizzle over the green tomato gravy

Season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
