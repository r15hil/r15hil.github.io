<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then add your basmati rice, sultanas, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop a few matchsticks from your ginger and finely chop (or grate) the rest

Slice your green chilli[es] in half lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and halved green chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast strips into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add the chopped chicken, chopped garlic, chopped ginger (save the matchsticks for later!), curry powder and a generous grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken has browned

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Cut your tomatoes into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the tomato stock to the pan with your chopped tomatoes and cook for 8-10 min or until sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Don't worry if it's a little thick, karahi is drier than most curries!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is done, add<span class="text-danger"> </span>your creamed coconut to the pot, cover with the lid and set aside for 2-3 min or until the coconut has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the coconut has melted, add your flaked almonds and half the chopped coriander to the rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your peshwari rice

Mix the remaining chopped coriander through the curry – this is your spicy karahi-style chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy karahi-style chicken with the peshwari rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved ginger matchsticks

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
