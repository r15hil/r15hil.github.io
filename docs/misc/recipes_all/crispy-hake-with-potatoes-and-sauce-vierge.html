<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your hake fillet[s] to a plate and season all over with a generous pinch of salt

Sprinkle your cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden, crisp and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are done, add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt to the pot and give everything a good shake up

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy hake with the buttery potatoes and a handful of shredded lettuce to the side with a lemon wedge

Spoon the sauce vierge over the crispy fish and drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
