<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes and fennel seeds (don't like aniseed? Just add a little!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have softened, add the sliced garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your soft cheese, lemon zest (not sure about citrus? Try using less!), half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good stir until the soft cheese has melted

Chop the lemon[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once melted, add the drained tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to the pan with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water

Give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your tomato & fennel sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

Tip: Add a little starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato & fennel sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni with the salad and lemon wedges to the side

Garnish the tortelloni with the remaining chopped parsley, drizzle the salad with some olive oil and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
