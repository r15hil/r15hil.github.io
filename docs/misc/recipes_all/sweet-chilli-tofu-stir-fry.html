<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the quarters so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<p>Once softened, add the crispy tofu and sweet chilli sauce to the pan with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until it's all coated in the sauce

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your plant-based sweet chilli tofu stir fry</p><br><br>
