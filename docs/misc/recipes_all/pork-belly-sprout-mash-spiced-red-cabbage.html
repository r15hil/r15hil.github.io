<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, then season with a pinch of salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and once very hot, add the pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 3-5 min or until nicely coloured</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the pork belly, fat-side up, to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and save the pan (and juices) for later

Put the tray in the oven for 40-45 min, or until it's crisp on the outside and cooked through

Once done, leave the pork to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the shredded red cabbage, balsamic vinegar, sultanas, star anise, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt to an oven-proof dish (or casserole dish with a lid) and give everything a good mix up

Cover the dish tightly with tin foil (or a matching lid) and put the dish in the oven for 35-40 min or until the cabbage is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into large bite-sized pieces

Cut the Brussels sprouts in half

Add the potatoes and Brussels sprouts to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender

Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> beef stock cube in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pork pan to a medium heat with approx. 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the reserved juice

Once hot, add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk in the beef stock and cook for 1-2 further or until a smooth gravy remains

Stir in the spiced plum chutney – this is your spiced plum gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes and sprouts are cooked, drain and return them to the pot

Return the pot to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a large knob of butter

Mash until smooth – this is your sprout mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once rested, slice the pork belly as thinly as you can using a sharp knife

Serve the pork belly with the sprout mash and braised red cabbage to the side and spoon over the spiced plum gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
