<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain your sweetcorn and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to char

Once done, transfer to a bowl and set aside for later (reserve the pan!) – this is your charred corn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the corn is charring, boil half a kettle

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chipotle stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has slightly softened, reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped garlic, half your ground smoked paprika, half your ground coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Cook for 1 min until fragrant, then add the chipotle stock

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining ground smoked paprika, remaining ground coriander and a pinch of salt and black pepper in a shallow bowl

Add your haddock bites to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the spices – these are your spiced haddock bites

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, top with the spiced haddock bites and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Mexican-style spiced haddock stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Add the charred corn, half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt and pepper to the cooked rice – this is your charred corn rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style spiced haddock stew with the charred corn rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
