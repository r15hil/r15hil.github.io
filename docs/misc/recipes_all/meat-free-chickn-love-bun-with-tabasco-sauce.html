<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 5-6 min <span class="text-danger">[7-9 min]</span> or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Set aside until serving and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add them to a baking tray (reserve the bowl) and crush with the base of a mug to flatten them

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil, a generous knob of butter alternative and a generous pinch of salt to the tray and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 18-22 min or until the potatoes are crisp and golden – these are your smashed potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are in the oven, add the meat-free chick’n to the reserved bowl with the soy sauce then mix well until evenly coated

Combine the cornflour, ground paprika and a pinch of salt in another bowl

Add the meat-free chick’n to the cornflour mixture and give everything a good mix up until the chick'n pieces are nicely coated – this is your coated meat-free chick’n</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chick’n and cook for 6-7 min, turning halfway, or until crisp, golden and warmed through – these are your crispy fried chick'n pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the meat-free chick’n is cooking, combine the mayo with 1/3 of the TABASCO® Sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your TABASCO® Sauce mayo

Wash the gem lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> leaves from the gem lettuce and set aside, then cut the inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the agave and the remaining TABASCO® Sauce (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl – this is your hot agave

Add the hot agave to the pan with the crispy fried chick'n pieces and stir to coat – this is your hot agave crispy fried chick'n</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burgers, top a toasted brioche base with the TABASCO® Sauce mayo and the hot agave crispy fried chick'n

Drizzle over any remaining hot agave, then top with a gem leaf and the toasted brioche lid

Serve the burger with the smashed potatoes and gem wedges drizzled with a little olive oil and a pinch of pepper to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
