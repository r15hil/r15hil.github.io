<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Sprinkle the cheezy breadcrumb mix over the fillets until they're totally covered

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min, or until the breadcrumb mixture is starting to turn golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your cheezy baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
