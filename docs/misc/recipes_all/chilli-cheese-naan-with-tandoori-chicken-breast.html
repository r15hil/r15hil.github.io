<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your ground smoked paprika and curry powder with half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add the chicken breast portions and sliced pepper to the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tandoori chicken is cooked, remove the baking tray[s] from the oven

Transfer the tandoori chicken to a clean board, reserving the tray[s]

Re-line the reserved baking tray[s] with baking paper, add your plain naans and top with the grated cheddar, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and charred pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 4 min or until the bread is warmed through and the cheese has melted – this is your chilli-cheese naan

Meanwhile, shred apart the tandoori chicken using two forks – this is your pulled tandoori chicken

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli-cheese naan with the spinach and pulled tandoori chicken layered on top  – this is your chilli-cheese naan with tandoori chicken

Drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
