<h4>Step 1</h4>

Tear off pieces of your beef mince, roughly shape into small meatballs (about 6 per person!) and add directly to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, set aside the steamed broccoli and drain the potatoes

Return the drained potatoes to the pot with a small knob of butter, a splash of milk and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash roughly – these are your crushed potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saucy onion gravy beef meatballs with the crushed potatoes and steamed broccoli to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
