<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large chunks

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then chop roughly

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper and courgette to a baking paper-lined baking tray with the onion wedges, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the vegetables are softened and golden – this is your roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Combine the chopped mint and natural yoghurt in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your mint yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped paneer and cook for 5-6 min or until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the paneer is golden, add your ground smoked paprika and cumin seeds to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat, then add your honey and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky chilli paneer</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add your vegetable stock mix to the cooked rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your seasoned rice

Once the roasted veg are softened and golden, remove the tray from the oven and transfer them to the seasoned rice and gently stir it all together – this is your roasted veg rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted veg rice with the sticky chilli paneer on top

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
