<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a full kettle

Cut your broccoli into small florets</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the broccoli florets to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min

After an initial 3 min, add your quick cook spaghetti and cook with the broccoli for another 2-3, until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti & broccoli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your broccoli into small florets

Once the spaghetti has had an initial 4 min, add the broccoli florets to the pot and cook for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti & broccoli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, tear your cheese flavour slices into rough bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Add your creamy single soy, torn cheeze, Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and vegetable stock mix and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your cheeze sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once thickened, stir in the drained spaghetti & broccoli and halved cherry tomatoes through the cheeze sauce – this is your plant-based broccoli cheeze pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based broccoli cheeze pasta and season with a grind of black pepper

Garnish with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
