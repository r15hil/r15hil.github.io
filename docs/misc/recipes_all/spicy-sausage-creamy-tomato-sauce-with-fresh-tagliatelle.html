<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for an initial 3-4 min, or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat is starting to brown, add the chopped garlic and most of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and chopped tomatoes to the pan and stir it all together

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce thickens slightly and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once your tagliatelle is ready, add your spinach to the pot and cook for a further 15 secs or until wilted, then once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Add the tagliatelle and spinach with half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) to the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is well coated – this is your spicy sausage & creamy tomato sauce with fresh tagliatelle (add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy sausage & creamy tomato sauce with fresh tagliatelle topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
