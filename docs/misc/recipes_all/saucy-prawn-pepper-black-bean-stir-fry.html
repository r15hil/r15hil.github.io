<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Deseed the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the wheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the noodles are soaking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced yellow pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, drain the softened wheat noodles, reserving 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain the king prawns

Once fragrant, add the king prawns with the black bean paste, Chinese rice wine and starchy noodle water

Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach

Add the drained wheat noodles to the pan with the spinach and cover with a lid for 1-2 min or until the spinach starts to wilt

Once slightly wilted, give everything a good mix up â€“ this is your saucy prawn & pepper black bean stir-fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saucy prawn & pepper black bean stir-fry in bowls

Garnish with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
