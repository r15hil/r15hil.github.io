<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and allow to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely grate your garlic

Chop your parsley and coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Add the diced shallot to a small bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken thigh to a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!), season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together until fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken thigh</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Dice your cucumber finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add half the chopped herbs (you’ll use the rest later!) to the quick-pickled shallot with your dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chimichurri-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the brown rice is cooked and slightly cooled, add the chopped tomato, diced cucumber and shredded lettuce to the pot with the chimichurri-style sauce

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, reserve the bowl – this is your chimichurri-style brown rice salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to the reserved bowl with your natural yoghurt, remaining chopped herbs and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chimmichuri-style brown rice salad topped with the spiced chicken thigh

Dollop over the garlic yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
