<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle, then separate the white duck fat and the duck jelly (you'll use these later!) from your duck leg[s]

Shred apart the duck leg[s] into large, bite-sized pieces using two forks (watch out for any bones!) – this is your pulled duck

Add the pulled duck to an oven-proof dish with the white duck fat and place in the oven for an initial 25 min or until brown and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the duck is cooking, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, diced carrot and bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Combine your beef stock mix and red wine paste with 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red wine stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the chopped garlic and tomato paste to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the red wine stock, half the chopped thyme (you'll use the rest later!) and duck jelly and cook for 4-5<span class="text-danger"> </span>min or until the sauce has thickened to a gravy like consistency – this is your pie filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, season with a pinch of pepper and mash until smooth

Once the duck has had an initial 25 min, pour the pie filling into the dish with the duck and give everything a good mix up

Top with the mashed potato, grated cheese and remaining chopped thyme and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your shredded duck leg pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and mint sauce

Mix it all together – these are your minted peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the shredded duck leg pie (discard the bay leaf!) with the minted peas to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
