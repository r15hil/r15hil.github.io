<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with the chopped creamed coconut, chopped ginger, chopped garlic, garam masala, ground coriander, vegetable stock mix, sultanas and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>cold water and stir it all together, then cover tightly with tin foil

Put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped coriander to a small bowl with the finely chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the juice of half your lime[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt, sugar and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander salsa

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your tamarind paste with a small knob of butter in a small bowl – this is your tamarind glaze

Carefully cut narrow slices (approx. 1cm apart) into the cooked sweet potatoes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – these are your hasselback sweet potatoes

Add the potatoes to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray, spread the tamarind glaze over the tops with the back of a spoon and put in the oven for an initial 4-5 min – these are your tamarind glazed sweet potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After the initial 4-5 min, remove the tray from the oven and carefully add your flaked almonds to the other side of the baking tray

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3-4 min or until the almonds are toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, divide the coconut rice between plates and top with a tamarind glazed sweet potato

Top with the coriander salsa, reserved green chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and toasted flaked almonds

Garnish with a lime wedge and season with a pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
