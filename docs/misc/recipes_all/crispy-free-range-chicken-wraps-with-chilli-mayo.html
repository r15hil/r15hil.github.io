<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy free range chicken strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
