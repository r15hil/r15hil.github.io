<p><strong>Description:</strong> If you like the flavour of curry, but aren’t a fan of heat then this Japanese-style pork is for (kats)YOU! Our lightly pickled salad is just the ticket to counterbalance the textures and richness. If you’re keen on presentation, spoon your rice into a small bowl, press it in firmly, and then turn out to form a perfect circular shape.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle (used in step 4)


Peel, top and tail the carrot<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Continue to peel lengths of carrot until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Once you've peeled as far as you can, grate the inner stem</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Heat 2-3 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large pan


Add the grated carrot, onion, curry powder and a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the stock cube and 300ml <span class="text-danger">(500ml)</span> of boiled water


Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(1 1/2 tbsp)</span> of flour to the carrot mixture, cook for 1 min


Stir in the stock and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">(1 tsp)</span> sugar, mixing well to combine


Continue to cook for 5-10 min or until thickened on a low heat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>

On a third plate, add the breadcrumbs</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice each pork loin steak in half lengthways, to form 4 <span class="text-danger">(8)</span> escalopes


Tip: Lay your hand flat over the steaks and carefully saw through with a sharp knife


Coat one escalope with the seasoned flour, tapping off any excess


Dip it in the egg and coat well, then roll it in the breadcrumbs and coat evenly

<h4>Step 8</h4>
