<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the aromatic tofu mixture and cook for 10 min stirring occasionally until golden and crisp

Once golden and crisp, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserving the pan – this is your crispy aromatic tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with the rice vinegar, half the sesame seeds (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of sugar

Mix well and set aside to marinate – this is your sesame pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pak choi bases and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Once softened, add the shredded pak choi tops and the drained noodles with the spicy hoisin sauce and give everything a good mix up until the pak choi tops have wilted – these are your hoisin noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hoisin noodles in bowls with the crispy aromatic tofu on top and the sesame pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the remaining sesame seeds and the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
