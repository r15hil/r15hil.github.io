<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>boiled water and stir in the tomato paste and Marmite – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the meat-free mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the chopped garlic with the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Strip the thyme leaves into the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened slightly – this is your meat-free mince & thyme mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Season the meat-free mince & thyme mixture with a generous grind of pepper, then transfer to an oven-proof dish

Top the mince mixture with the chips

Tip: Try to put the crispiest chips at the bottom and balance the rest over the top so that they don’t sink!

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chips are crispy and cooked through – this is your chip-topped meat-free mince & thyme pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pie is almost done, reboil a kettle

Add the blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 1-2 min or until bright green and tender

Once done, drain the cooked peas and return them to the pot with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chip-topped meat-free mince & thyme pie with the peas to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
