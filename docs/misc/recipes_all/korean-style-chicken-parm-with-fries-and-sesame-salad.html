<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the fries are cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water – this is your gochujang stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened, then add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the gochujang stock with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for a further 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your gochujang sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover the chicken breast portions in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness then season with a pinch of salt

Add a handful of flour to a plate, a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it into the milk and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your rice vinegar in a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil – this is your dressing

Add the salad to the dressing with your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fries are golden, remove the tray from the oven and push the fries to one side

Add the crispy chicken to the other side of the tray, then top with the gochujang sauce and grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your Korean-style chicken parm</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Korean-style chicken parm with the fries and sesame salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
