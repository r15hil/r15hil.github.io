<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Score the fatty side of your pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a pinch of salt and rub it into the criss-cross pattern

Add the scored pork belly, fat-side down, to the dish and cook for 2 min or until the fat is slightly golden, then remove to a plate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large chunks

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Add the onion wedges and carrot discs to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your soy sauce to the dish with your Chinese rice wine, five-spice mix (not a fan of five-spice? Only add a little!), ground smoked paprika, ginger & garlic paste, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water, bring to the boil, then add the pork belly to the dish, skin-side up

Put the dish in the oven and cook, uncovered, for an initial 40 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pork is golden brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pork has had 25 min, reboil the kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pork has had 40 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped pepper

Tip: Nestle the pepper chunks into the sauce as much as you can!

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for 15 min further or until the pepper is tender

Once done, remove the cooked pork belly from the dish, leave to rest for 5 min, then slice into 3 slices per person on a clean chopping board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the stew with the pork belly slices and the cooked rice to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Dig in!</p><br><br>
