<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your creamy single soy and wilted spinach to a large bowl with your roasted garlic paste, most of your basil (save some for garnish), the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!), vegetable stock mix and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your plant-based creamy spinach & basil sauce</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a small, dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nut & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>
