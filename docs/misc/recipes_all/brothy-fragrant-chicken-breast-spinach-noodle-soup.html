<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with your soy sauce and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dissolve your pho broth paste in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had an initial 5-6 min, add your ginger & garlic paste and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the stock to the pan with the chicken and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for a final 3 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the spinach to the pan and mix everything together until the spinach has slightly wilted – this is your fragrant chicken breast & spinach broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the soaked noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles to a bowl and pour in the fragrant chicken breast & spinach broth

Drizzle over your toasted sesame oil and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
