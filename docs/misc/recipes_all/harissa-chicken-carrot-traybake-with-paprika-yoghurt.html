<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, chopped carrot and onion wedges to a large tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add most of your ground smoked paprika (save some for later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a generous drizzle of olive oil and half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to a medium bowl

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have slightly softened, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your chicken thighs, drizzle the marinade over the chicken then return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven and cook for a further 12-14 min or until almost cooked (reserve the bowl)

Remove the tray[s] from the oven, spread your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over the chicken and return to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa chicken thigh & carrot traybake</p><br><br>

Stir it all together – this is your paprika yoghurt</p><br><br>
