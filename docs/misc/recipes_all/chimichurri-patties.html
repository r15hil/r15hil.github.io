<p><strong>Description:</strong> Chimichurri is an Argentinian steak sauce - a form of pesto if you like, but without the cheese or nuts. It’s vibrant, green, and has a sharpness and slight chilli kick to it. This means it’s cuts through our bunless burger and sweet potato wedges like nothing else.
