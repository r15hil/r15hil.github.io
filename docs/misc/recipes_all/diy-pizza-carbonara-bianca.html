<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9, then put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up

Tip: This will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!

Add your dried yeast<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your soft cheese to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous grind of black pepper

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your white sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your smoked streaky bacon into small pieces

Drain your mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your chives finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the bowl with the yeast mixture

Gradually add up to 75ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[100ml] </span>[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 ball per person

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press each dough ball in the centre and push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is slightly smaller than a side plate (you will make them bigger in the pan!) – this is your pizza base

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (or two!) (preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, carefully add the pizza base[s] to the pan[s], pushing the dough out to the edge to help shape the crust

Tip: To pick up the pizza dough, gently flip it over the back of your hand to stop it ripping!

Add the white sauce to each pizza and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon (be careful of the hot pan!)

Cook the pizza base[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>for 3-4 min or until the crust has started to puff up, then remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and slide the pizza base[s] onto the tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Repeat this process for the remaining pizza base[s] (cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!)

Top the pizza with the torn mozzarella, chopped bacon and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), the chopped chives and a grind of pepper

Drizzle the crust[s] with olive oil and put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your pizza carbonara bianca</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut your tomato[es] into wedges and wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and tomato wedges to a bowl with your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic tomato salad

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese over the pizza and serve with the balsamic tomato salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
