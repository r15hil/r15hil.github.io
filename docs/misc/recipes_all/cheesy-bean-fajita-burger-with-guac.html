<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Add the drained black beans to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, egg[s], ground cumin, half your ground smoked paprika and half the grated cheese (save the rest for later!)

Mash it all together until you have a chunky, wet mixture and all of the breadcrumbs are incorporated (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your cheesy bean burger mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide the cheesy bean burger mixture and shape into 1 flat patty per person

Line a tray with non-stick baking paper, add the cheesy bean patty[ies] to the tray and put in the oven for an initial 20 min until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the burger is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and half the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, remove from the heat and set aside – this is your fried onion & pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your smashed avocado to a food processor with the remaining sliced onion, juice of half your lime[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz it all up until smooth – this is your guac

Meanwhile, add the remaining ground smoked paprika to a bowl with your mayo and a squeeze of lime juice – this is your smoky paprika mayo

Slice the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person and set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the burger is starting to crisp, remove from the oven and top with remaining grated cheese

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half, then add the brioche halves to the opposite side of the tray (cooking for 4 or more? Use two trays!) and return it to the oven for 2-3 min until all the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread a dollop of smoky paprika mayo over the brioche base, then top with a cheesy bean patty, a dollop of guac, the fried onion & pepper and top with a brioche lid – this is your cheesy bean fajita burger

Serve with the chips to the side and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
