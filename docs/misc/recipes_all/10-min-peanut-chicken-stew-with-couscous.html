<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until golden</p><br><br>

Add the shredded kale and cook, covered, for 2-4 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peanut & chicken stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the peanut & chicken stew with the sun-dried tomato couscous to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
