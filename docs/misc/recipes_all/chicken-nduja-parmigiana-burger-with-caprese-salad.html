<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate, then combine your panko breadcrumbs with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper on a plate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the milk and then firmly press into the seasoned breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over

Add the coated chicken to one side of a baking paper-lined tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic, tomato paste, dried oregano, 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your ‘Nduja tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Cut 1 mozzarella round per person, then slice the remaining mozzarella finely

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop half your basil finely, including the stalks and keep the remaining basil leaves whole

Combine the chopped basil in a bowl with your mayo and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your basil mayo

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had an initial 25 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and spoon your 'Nduja tomato sauce equally over the top

Top with the mozzarella rounds and return to the oven for 6-7 min or until the mozzarella has melted – this is your chicken & 'Nduja parmigiana

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray[s], cut side up, and put them in the oven for the final 3-4 min or until toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread the toasted brioche base with the basil mayo, then top with the chicken & 'Nduja parmigiana and a toasted brioche lid and serve the fries to the side

Serve the sliced avocado, tomato rounds, remaining sliced mozzarella and remaining basil leaves to the side with the remaining balsamic vinegar drizzled over – this is your caprese salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
