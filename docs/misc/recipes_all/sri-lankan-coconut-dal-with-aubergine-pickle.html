<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice half your shallots, then peel and finely slice half your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 600ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[800ml] </span>[1L] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and discard, then slice lengthways, into strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the aubergine strips with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 10-12 min, turning occasionally until golden and tender

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a separate pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, sliced garlic, curry powder and half your ground turmeric (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min, then add the lentils and cook for 1 min further

Add the coconut stock, bring to the boil over a high heat, and cook for 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender and starting to break down – this is your Sri Lankan-style coconut dal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, slice your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, then slice diagonally into strips

Peel and chop the remaining shallot[s] into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Combine the chopped garlic with the chopped ginger, chopped coriander, cider vinegar, black mustard seeds and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>sugar in a bowl – this is your pickling liquid</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is golden and tender, transfer it to kitchen paper<span class="text-danger"> </span>and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and shallot wedges with the remaining ground turmeric and cook for 2-3 min

Return the cooked aubergine to the pan with the pickling liquid and cook for 2-3 min or until all the liquid has evaporated – this is your aubergine pickle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sri Lankan-style coconut dal with the basmati rice to the side

Top with the aubergine pickle, garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
