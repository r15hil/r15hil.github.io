<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into matchsticks

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the rest

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Bash your Fable pulled mushrooms with a rolling pin to break them up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the bashed Fable pulled mushrooms with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until browned, breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go – these are your pulled Fable mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop the lime[s] in half

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the finely chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with the juice of the chopped lime[s], half your soy sauce, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), 3 tsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tsp]</span> sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Vietnamese-style dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pulled Fable mushrooms have browned, add the remaining soy sauce, remaining chopped garlic and lime zest to the pan

Stir it all together and cook for a final 1 min or until fragrant – these are your Vietnamese-style pulled Fable mushrooms</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the basmati rice topped with the Vietnamese-style pulled mushrooms, shredded lettuce and carrot matchsticks

Drizzle over the Vietnamese-style dressing and garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and crushed peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
