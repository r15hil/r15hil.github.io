<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potatoes and salt (optional) to a pot with a lid, cover with boiled water by 5cm and bring to the boil with a lid on a high heat


Once boiling, boil for 5-7 min, or until you can pierce them easily with a knife, then drain and steam dry for 5 min in a colander


Reserve the pot for step 7</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the leeks in half lengthways, discarding the root ends


Slice the lengths into 1cm slices, then wash the sliced leek in a colander under the cold tap to remove any grit


Peel and finely chop or grate the garlic


Heat a large pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> (2 tsp)</span> of olive oil on a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>When hot, add the chicken, leek and garlic with a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the chicken and softened leek to a plate


Return the pan to a medium-low heat and melt 30g <span class="text-danger">(60g)</span> of butter


Once melted, stir in 30g <span class="text-danger">(60g)</span> of flour and cook for 2-3 min, whisking constantly - this is your 'roux'

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">(ves)</span> and stir constantly until a smooth, thickened sauce remains


Once the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chicken and leek mixture, the cheddar and half of the Dijon mustard&nbsp;


Season generously with salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the steamed potatoes to their cooking pot and crush them lightly with a masher (and a knob of butter, optional)


Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and top with the crushed potatoes, then oven roast for 10 min or until bubbling


Meanwhile, combine the remaining Dijon with the vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(3 tbsp)</span> of olive oil to make a dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Taste your dressing and season with salt and pepper


Wash and finely shred the little gem, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">(s)&nbsp;</span>


Toss the dressing through the salad and serve alongside the chicken pie


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
