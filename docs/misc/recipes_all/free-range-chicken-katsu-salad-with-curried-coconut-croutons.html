<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Slice your red chilli[es] finely, then combine the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and half your rice vinegar (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped creamed coconut to a medium bowl with half your curry powder (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and stir to combine – this is your crouton marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Press the torn ciabatta into the marinade until all the sauce soaks into the bread – these are your coconut curried croutons

Add the coconut curried croutons to a baking paper-lined tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the croutons are crispy around the edges

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining curry powder and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer it to a bowl and reserve the pan

Add your mango chutney and soy sauce to the bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and mix it all together – this is your katsu dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the free range chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with some cling film

Bash the chicken with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your chicken escalope</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs and your ground turmeric to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your panko mix

Coat the chicken escalope in a drizzle of vegetable oil, then press into the panko mix firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your breaded chicken

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Drain the quick-pickled chilli, add the pickling liquid to the katsu dressing and stir it all together</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>On a clean board, slice the breaded chicken finely into strips

Serve the shredded lettuce, carrot & cabbage slaw mix and curried coconut croutons in bowls

Top with the sliced breaded chicken and quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), then drizzle the katsu dressing all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
