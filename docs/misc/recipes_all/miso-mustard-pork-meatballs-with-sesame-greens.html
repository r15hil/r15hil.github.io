<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add the chopped shallot, pork mince (remove the paper if required!), panko breadcrumbs and half the chopped ginger (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your pork mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide and shape your pork mixture into meatballs (3 per person!)

Add the ginger pork meatballs to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Put they tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, boil half a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your toasted sesame oil with the chopped green beans, remaining chopped ginger and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 4-5 min or until the beans are beginning to soften

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if it's looking a little dry!

Once beginning to soften, add the spinach and cook for 1-2 min further or until wilted – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the greens are cooked, remove them from the pan and set aside until serving, reserve the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat (no need to clean!)

Once hot, add the miso-mustard sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through and slightly thickened</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the ginger pork meatballs with the brown rice and sesame greens to the side

Drizzle the miso-mustard sauce over the meatballs

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
