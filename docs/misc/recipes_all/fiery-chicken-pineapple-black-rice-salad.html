<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Add your black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 30 min or until it's tender (it will still have a slight bite to it when cooked)

Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a dry, large, wide-based pan over a high heat

Once hot, add your pineapple rings (reserve the juice!) and cook for 2-4 min on each side or until browned and caramelised – this is your caramelised pineapple

Transfer to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your ground allspice and smoked paprika on a plate with your dried oregano, cayenne pepper (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Season with pepper and a very generous pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your fiery seasoning

Add the flattened chicken to the fiery seasoning and mix until it's fully coated in all the spices – this your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side pressing down firmly with a spatula until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fiery chicken</p><br><br>

Add the shredded lettuce and the cooked black rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your black rice salad

<h4>Step 8</h4>
