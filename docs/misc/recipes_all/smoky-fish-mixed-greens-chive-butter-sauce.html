<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with a lid with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook, covered, for an initial 7 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and place on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim your green beans, then chop them in half

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had 7 min, add the halved green beans and Tenderstem broccoli to the pot (check the potatoes are nearly cooked first!) and cook, covered for 4-8 min further or until both are fork-tender

Drain everything and set aside until serving – this is your mixed greens & potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add your clotted cream and a splash of milk

Whisk to combine into a thin buttery sauce, then remove from the heat and add the chopped chives

Season with a small pinch of salt and plenty of pepper – this is your chive butter sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky basa with the mixed greens & potatoes to the side

Spoon the chive butter sauce over the fish

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
