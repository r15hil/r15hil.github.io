<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the eggs from cracking) and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, medium-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the boiled egg[s] to the bowl and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> milk to a bowl with half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add your diced chicken breast to the marinade and give everything a good mix up then set aside until later

Tip: This will help to tenderise your chicken!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and grate your garlic

Add your mayo to a separate bowl with your dried oregano, grated garlic, the remaining white wine vinegar, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain the chicken from the marinade, discard the marinade

Add your ground smoked paprika and ground turmeric to the bowl and mix it all up

Add your cornflour with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix until the chicken is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your popcorn chicken

Once crispy, transfer to kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, layer the shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, sliced cucumber and drained sweetcorn in rows

Top with the egg quarters and popcorn chicken – this is your popcorn chicken cobb salad

Drizzle the ranch-style dressing over everything

Dig in!</p><br><br>
