<p><strong>Description:</strong> You'll bash these pork steaks flat, a technique known as 'escaloping'. You'll learn how to make a homemade apple sauce, (which is ever so easy) before piling the sauce and cheese over the steaks so that they melt in the oven. Served with crispy potatoes and mustard green beans. Sorry for being a bit cheesy, but this dish is the apple of our eye!</p>
