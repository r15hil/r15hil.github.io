<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add the macaroni to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min or until cooked with a bite

Once done, drain the cooked macaroni reserving a cup of starchy pasta water and set aside until later, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the chicken thighs into small bite-sized pieces and add to a large bowl with half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the natural yoghurt, the ground paprika, ground turmeric, garam masala, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining natural yoghurt for another recipe!

Give everything a good mix up, then set aside – this is your chicken tikka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and chopped garlic with the curry powder and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the shallot – this is your roux

Grate the cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Gradually whisk 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, then cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your curried béchamel sauce

Once thickened, add the drained macaroni to the curried béchamel sauce along with 3/4 of the grated cheese (save the rest for later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mac 'n' cheese mixture

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the mac 'n' cheese mixture to an oven-proof dish and top with the chicken tikka, remaining grated cheese and nigella seeds

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the top is golden and bubbling – this is your chicken tikka x mac 'n' cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the mac 'n' cheese is cooking, roughly chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Add the shredded lettuce to a large bowl with the chopped tomato, white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken tikka x mac 'n' cheese with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
