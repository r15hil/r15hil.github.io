<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Slice the chicken breast portion[s] lengthways into 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>strips per person

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!) and combine with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your curry powder with a drizzle of the coconut stock (save the rest for later!) in a large bowl with a pinch of salt

Add the chicken strips, then mix well and set aside to marinate

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining coconut stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 5-10 min or until it has reduced to the consistency of a thick custard, stirring occasionally – this is your satay sauce

Once thickened, transfer to a bowl and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, then add it to a separate pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a small bowl with your rice vinegar and a generous pinch of salt – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat

Once hot, cook the chicken for 5-6 min on each side, turning once, or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and slightly charred – this is your Thai-style chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine the brown rice, quick-pickled cucumber, shredded lettuce and half the satay sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a large bowl – this is your lighter satay salad with pickled cucumber

Tip: Add an extra splash of water if the sauce has thickened too quickly!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style chicken over the satay salad with pickled cucumber – this is your lighter chicken satay salad with pickled cucumber

Drizzle the remaining satay sauce all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
