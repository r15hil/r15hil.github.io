<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cauliflower florets to a baking tray with the ground paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-30 min or until the cauliflower is golden and crisp – this is your spiced cauliflower</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Reboil a kettle

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly</p><br><br>

Once done, set them aside to cool before chopping roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Sprinkle over the chopped toasted almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
