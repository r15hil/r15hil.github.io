<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into thin wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the wedges are in the oven, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Season the butterflied chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and coat in your ground coriander

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned butterflied chicken and cook for 4 min on each side until golden, then turn the heat down to medium and cook for a further 3-4 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and chop half your red onion[s] into wedges

Dice the remaining onion finely

Once the wedges have had 15 min, add the onion wedges to the tray[s] and return to the oven for 10-15 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop your cherry tomatoes

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped cherry tomatoes, diced red onion, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice from half your lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl

Add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your smashed avocado to a bowl

Add the remaining chopped coriander, the juice of the remaining lime[s] and a little drizzle of olive oil then season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your guac</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the butterflied chicken over the guac with the roasted potato & onion wedges to the side

Dollop the zingy salsa over the wedges – these are your salsa wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
