<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with your dried sage, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your sage chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, add a handful of flour to a plate

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to another plate

Bash half your crispy onions (save the rest for garnish!) with a rolling pin until finely crushed

Add the crushed crispy onions and ground paprika to a separate plate with your panko breadcrumbs and a small pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your crispy onion mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken with a rolling pin until evenly flattened

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it to the vegetable oil and firmly press into the crispy onion mix to evenly coat all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the coated chicken to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy onion chicken

While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your soy sauce and chicken stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water with your onion marmalade and a pinch of salt – this is your gravy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, until you're left with a sandy paste

Stir the gravy stock into the sandy paste and cook for 5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your sweet onion gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove 1 lettuce leaf per person from the lettuce and set aside, shred the inner core

Combine your white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl with a small pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your salad dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the chicken is nearly cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray[s] (cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!)

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your burger, top the brioche base with a drizzle of the sweet onion gravy, a lettuce leaf and the crispy onion chicken

Top with the remaining crispy onions and the brioche lid

Serve the sage chips, shredded lettuce and any remaining sweet onion gravy on the side, then drizzle the salad dressing over the shredded lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
