<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Tip: This is to warm up your pittas, so alternatively just use your toaster!

Boil a kettle

Add the couscous and sultanas to a heatproof bowl with a generous pinch of salt and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the wholemeal pittas to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the natural yoghurt with the sriracha hot chilli sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your spicy yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Slice the halloumi into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> slices

Once hot, add the halloumi to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until golden all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the halloumi is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Tip: If you're using a toaster, heat up the pittas now!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once all the water has been absorbed by the couscous and sultanas, add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the flaked almonds and chopped parsley to the couscous and give everything a good mix up

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the toasted pitta bread in half and then stuff them with some seasonal salad, halloumi and spicy yoghurt

Serve the filled pittas with the couscous and any remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and garnish with a wedge of lemon and enjoy!</p><br><br>
