<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and combine with your panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your lemon breadcrumbs

Roll the zested lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Preheat the air fryer to 180°C</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Season your basa fillet[s] with a pinch of salt, then drizzle with a little olive oil and press them into the lemon breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

Add the breaded basa to the air fryer basket with a generous spray of olive oil and cook for 5 min on each side (air fryer cooking times may vary) or until cooked through and golden – this is your crispy basa (air fryers work best when the food is spaced out in a single layer, you may need to do this in batches!)

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the leek is cooking, chop your waxy potatoes (skins on) in half

Add the halved potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, add your blanched peas with a splash of cold water and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min further or until the peas are warmed through – this is your leek & peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Once the potatoes are cooked through, add a knob of butter, a pinch of salt and half the chopped chives (you'll use the rest later!)

Mix it all together – these are your buttery chive potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the juice of half the lemon[s] and the remaining chopped chives – this is your lemon mayo

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy basa with the buttery chive potatoes, leek & peas and lemon mayo to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
