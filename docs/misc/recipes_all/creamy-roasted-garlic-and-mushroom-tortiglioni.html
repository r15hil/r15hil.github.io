<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut 1 piece of baking paper (or tin foil) approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper

Lay your garlic cloves (skins on) in the middle of the paper, drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the garlic to form a sealed parcel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Roughly chop your chestnut mushrooms

Add the chopped mushrooms to one side of a baking tray and spread them out as much as possible

Add the garlic parcel to the other side of the tray[s] and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until the mushrooms are starting to shrivel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni and drizzle with a little olive oil in the colander, reserve the pot

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your balsamic dressing

Once the mushrooms have had 10-15 min, add your dried oregano with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give them a good mix up and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min further or until tender – these are your herby mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your crème fraîche, vegetable stock and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken

Once the mushrooms are done, carefully squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins and mash with a fork, discard the skins

Mix the drained pasta and mashed roasted garlic in the pot – this is your creamy roasted garlic tortiglioni</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and diced tomato to the balsamic dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herby mushrooms over the creamy roasted garlic tortiglioni

Garnish with the chopped chives and remaining grated cheese and serve the balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
