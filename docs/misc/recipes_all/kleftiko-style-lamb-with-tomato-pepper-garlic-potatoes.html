<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil half a kettle, then take your lamb out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes, chop them into bite-sized pieces and add them to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork, put the bowl in the microwave for 5-6 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dissolve your tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [250ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[380ml] </span>boiled water with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato stock

Cut a piece of baking paper (or two!), double the length of a baking tray

Add the baking paper to the baking tray[s], leaving enough excess to fold over on itself to form a parcel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the microwaved potatoes, chopped pepper, onion wedges, cherry tomatoes and peeled garlic to the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil, a small knob of butter dotted all over and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Pour the tomato stock all over the vegetables, sprinkle over 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Divide all the ingredients equally between the 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Fold the baking paper over the top scrunching it together to form one big parcel in the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 35 min or until the potatoes are completely softened and saucy

Once completely cooked, mix everything together, being careful not to rip the baking paper – these are your tomato & pepper garlic potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove the string from your lamb leg joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rub the lamb leg joint[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and season with your Mediterranean-style seasoning and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the seasoned lamb to a separate baking tray with the halved lemon, cut side up, and cook for 25 min or until the lamb is cooked through and very slightly pink inside

Tip: Prefer no pink meat? Cook your lamb for 3-5 min longer!

Once the lamb is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board to rest for 3 min before slicing – this is your kleftiko-style lamb

Slice the rested lamb finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato & pepper garlic potatoes with the sliced kleftiko-style lamb to the side

Squeeze the roasted lemon juice over the top (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
