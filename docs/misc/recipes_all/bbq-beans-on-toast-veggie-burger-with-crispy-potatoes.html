<h4>Step 1</h4>

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the ciabattas are toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>To build your burgers, spoon the BBQ beans on the base of each toasted ciabatta base, then top with a cheeseburger veggie patty and a toasted ciabatta lid – these are your BBQ beans on toast veggie burgers</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the BBQ beans on toast veggie burger with the crispy potatoes, lettuce quarters and chive mayo to the side

Dress the lettuce quarters with the remaining white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a good grind of pepper
