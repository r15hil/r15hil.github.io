<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the tofu pieces to a bowl with your gluten free soy sauce and your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy tofu

Once crispy, set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, creamed coconut and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the drained noodles, coconut stock and spinach and give everything a good mix up until the spinach has wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, stir through the crispy tofu to warm through – these are your coconutty curried noodles with crispy tofu

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconutty curried noodles with crispy tofu in a bowl
