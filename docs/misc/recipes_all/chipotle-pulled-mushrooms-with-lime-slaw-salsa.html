<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Meanwhile, bash your Fable pulled mushrooms with a rolling pin to break them up

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the bashed Fable pulled mushrooms with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until browned

Once the mushrooms have browned, shred them apart gently, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’ – these are your pulled mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan along with your ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, chopped garlic and tomato paste

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are fragrant, add your stock to the pan, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened, then stir through half the lime zest (save the rest for later!) – these are your chipotle pulled mushrooms

Tip: Add a splash of water if your mushrooms are looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] thinly

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with the juice of half your zested lime[s], chopped spring onion, mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lime slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Finely dice your tomato[es]

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with the remaining lime zest, a squeeze of lime juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your salsa

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chipotle pulled mushrooms with the cooked rice, lime slaw and salsa to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
