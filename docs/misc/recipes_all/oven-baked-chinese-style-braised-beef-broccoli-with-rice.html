<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced beef and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped onion, sliced garlic and cornflour and give everything a good mix

Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water with your beef stock mix

Bring to the boil over a high heat and put the dish in the oven, covered, and cook for an initial 50 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through – this is your Chinese-style braised beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the Chinese-style braised beef has had 30-35 min, reboil a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the Chinese-style braised beef is ready, remove the dish from the oven

Add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli to the dish with your tamari soy sauce, ginger paste and hoisin sauce

Stir it all together and return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for 12-15 min or until the broccoli is tender and the sauce has thickened – this is your oven baked Chinese-style braised beef & broccoli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the oven baked Chinese-style braised beef & broccoli to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop!) then serve with the baked rice to the side
