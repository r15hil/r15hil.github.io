<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a big pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 5 min, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 min or until softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and your garlic, then finely chop (or grate) both

Bash your lemongrass stalk[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a rolling pin, cut it down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the soft inner core[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span>[450ml] </span>cold water and the outer lemongrass layers and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<p>Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped lemongrass core[s], curry powder and nigella seeds to the onion pan and cook for 2 min

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>On a clean board, chop your basa fillets into large bite-sized pieces

Add 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span> [350ml]</span> boiled water, your softened creamed coconut and your vegetable stock mix to the pan and stir for 2 min until everything has combined, then gently add the chopped basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce to low and cook, covered for 5 min, or until cooked through – this is your basa, pepper & lemongrass curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir half of the chopped coriander through the basa, pepper & lemongrass curry and serve over the lemongrass rice, discard the lemongrass

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
