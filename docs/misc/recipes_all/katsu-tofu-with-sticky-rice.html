<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain your tofu then pat it dry with kitchen paper and slice it lengthways into<span class="text-danger"> </span>strips

Add your mayo and panko breadcrumbs to separate plates and season the breadcrumbs with a pinch of salt

Toss the tofu strips in the mayo until lightly coated, then press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the breaded tofu to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Drizzle generously with vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – this is your tofu katsu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, stir vigorously to release the starch, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your sticky rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel your shallot[s] and finely slice into rings

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your red wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a bowl

Add the shallot rings, a pinch of salt and sugar to the bowl then set aside until later – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger and cook for 3 min or until fragrant

Add your curry powder and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Gradually whisk in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once your sauce has thickened, stir in your soy sauce and mango chutney – this is your katsu sauce

Meanwhile, drain the quick-pickled shallot, reserving 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the pickling liquid

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add it to a bowl with the quick-pickled shallot, reserved pickling liquid, grated carrot, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tofu katsu over the katsu sauce with the sticky rice and salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
