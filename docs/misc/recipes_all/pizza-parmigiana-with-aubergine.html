<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add the dried yeast<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the baby plum tomatoes in half then trim the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice in half lengthways, then into half-moons

Add the aubergine slices to one side of a separate baking tray (use baking paper to avoid it sticking) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Add the halved baby plum tomatoes to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the aubergine has started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce

Drain and pat the mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast and gently mix with a plastic spatula

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time and continue to mix until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press each dough ball in the centre and gently push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is slightly smaller than a side plate (you will make them bigger in the pan!) – these are your pizza bases, then heat a large, dry, non-stick, wide-based pan (or two) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, carefully add the pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the pan<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, pushing the dough out to the edge to help shape the crust

Tip: To pick up the pizza dough, gently flip it over the back of your hand to stop it ripping!

Add 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1/4]</span> of the tomato sauce to each pizza and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon (be careful of the hot pan!)

Cook the pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> for 3-4 min or until the crust has started to puff up, then remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and slide the pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>onto the tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Repeat this process for the next pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the trays to avoid raw dough!)

Top them with the dried oregano, roasted tomatoes, torn mozzarella, roasted aubergine and half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), then tear over the basil leaves

Drizzle the crusts with olive oil, then put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min until the crust has puffed up and browned</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to a bowl with the balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your rocket salad

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese over the pizzas and serve the rocket salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
