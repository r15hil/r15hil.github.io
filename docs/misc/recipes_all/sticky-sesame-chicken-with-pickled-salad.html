<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Dice your cucumber

Add the diced cucumber and sliced radishes to a bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain into a sieve and set aside, reserving the pot for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your diced chicken thigh, five-spice and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown slightly, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until the chicken is nearly cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato ketchup, soy sauce and honey in a bowl – this is your soy & honey sauce

Add the soy & honey sauce to the pan and increase the heat to medium and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and a sticky sauce has formed

Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat

Rinse your shredded kale

Add the drained rice with the shredded kale and cook for 2 min or until the kale is mixed through and beginning to wilt

Remove from the heat and season with a pinch of salt – this is your brown rice & kale</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky chicken thigh over the brown rice & kale with the quick-pickled salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
