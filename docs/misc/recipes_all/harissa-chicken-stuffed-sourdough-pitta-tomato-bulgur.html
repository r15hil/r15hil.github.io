<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the bulgur is tender, drain and return to the pot

Return the pot to a low heat with a small knob of butter, the chopped garlic and your tomato paste

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min, or until fragrant and well coated, stirring constantly – this is your tomatoey bulgur</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your sourdough pitta[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and add your harissa paste and a small splash of your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your harissa chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice open the top of the warmed pitta and fill it with your mayo, an outer lettuce leaf, a few tomato slices and the harissa chicken

Serve the tomatoey bulgur to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the bulgur into a small bowl and turn out

Serve the shredded lettuce with the remaining white wine vinegar and a small drizzle of olive oil and enjoy!</p><br><br>
