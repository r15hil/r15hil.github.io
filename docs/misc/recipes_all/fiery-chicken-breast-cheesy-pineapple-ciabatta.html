<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and allspice to the pan and cook for 2 min

Add your soy sauce and a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the mayo with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> pineapple juice (save the slices for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pineapple mayo

Tip: Keep the remaining pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Separate 2 leaves per person from the lettuce

Chop the inner core[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters lengthways

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are almost ready, drain your pineapple slices and add them to a separate baking tray (or two!), then arrange into 2 piles per person

Top the pineapple slices with the grated cheddar cheese

Add your ciabatta[s] to the tray[s] and put in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty and the cheese is melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once pulled, mix the chicken in with the pan juices – this is your shredded fiery chicken

Cut the ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble each ciabatta with a lettuce leaf, a cheesy pineapple slice, the shredded fiery chicken, another lettuce leaf, cheesy pineapple slice and finally a dollop of pineapple mayo

Serve with the chips and lettuce wedges on the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
