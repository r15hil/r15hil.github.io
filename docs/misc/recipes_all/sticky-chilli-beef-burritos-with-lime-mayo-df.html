<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the beef is cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Cut your lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half the lime with your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once browned, add your ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the beef and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the chopped tomato, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and honey and cook for a further 3-5 min or until the tomato begins to break down and the beef becomes crispy and sticky (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky chilli beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and beginning to crisp slightly 

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Build your own burritos by layering up a warmed tortilla with some cooked rice, a handful of shredded lettuce and a dollop of the sticky chilli beef

Top with the torn cheese and a drizzle of lime mayo, then roll your burritos up tightly

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
