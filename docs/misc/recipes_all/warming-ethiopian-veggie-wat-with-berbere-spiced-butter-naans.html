<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take a knob of butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine and sweet potato to the pan with the sliced onion and a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine a pinch of your berbere seasoning with the softened butter in a bowl and mix it all together, then set aside – this is your berbere-spiced butter

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Once the onion has softened, add the remaining berbere seasoning and tomato paste to the pot with your ginger & garlic paste and give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils and vegetable stock mix to the pot with 500ml<span class="text-purple"> [700ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to medium

Cook for a further 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender and the sweet potatoes are fork-tender – this is your Ethiopian-style veggie wat

While everything's cooking, reboil the kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a small pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the egg from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the soft-boiled egg[s] to the bowl until cooled

Set aside, then once cooled, peel the cooled soft-boiled egg[s] and cut them in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the sweet potatoes are nearly fork-tender, add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Once done, remove the warmed naan from the toaster and add the berbere-spiced butter – this is your berbere-spiced butter naan</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Ethiopian-style veggie wat in bowls and top with a soft-boiled egg half

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Serve the berbere-spiced butter naan to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
