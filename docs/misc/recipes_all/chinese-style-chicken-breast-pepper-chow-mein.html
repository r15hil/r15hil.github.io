<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the noodles and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, spring onion batons and sliced pepper to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, reduce the heat to low and add your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, sesame noodles and a splash of water to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are coated in the sauce – this is your Chinese-style chicken breast & pepper chow mein</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Chinese-style chicken breast & pepper chow mein

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
