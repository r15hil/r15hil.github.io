<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Chop your halloumi into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the chopped halloumi to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water in a heatproof bowl

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the spicy halloumi stew with the sultana couscous to the side

Garnish with your flaked almonds
