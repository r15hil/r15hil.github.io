<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Add your beef mince to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the seasoned mince and shape into meatballs (5 per person!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Once the meatballs have browned, add the diced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and beef stock mix to the pan with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 8-9 min, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Moroccan-style meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the meatballs are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your salad dressing

Add your salad to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Moroccan-style meatballs with the bulgur wheat and dressed salad to the side

Dollop over your natural yoghurt and sprinkle over your 3 seed mix

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
