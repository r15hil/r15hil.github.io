<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into rough bite-size pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Coat the steak[s] in your smoked paprika and season generously with salt – this is your spiced steak[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to the pot with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, your gram flour and ground turmeric and give everything a good shake until the potatoes are fully coated

Add the coated potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crispy and golden – these are your viazi karai-style potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the chopped garlic, chopped tomato and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add 120ml <span class="text-purple">[160ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water with your honey and tamarind paste and cook for a further 6-7 min or until thickened to a syrup-like consistency – this is your tamarind chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once thickened, transfer the tamarind chutney to a small bowl and reserve the pan

Dice your cucumber and remaining tomato[es]

Cut your lime[s] in half

Combine the diced cucumber and diced tomato in a medium bowl with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the juice of the lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and a pinch of salt – this is your kachumbari salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the potatoes have 10 min left, return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once very hot, add the spiced steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Transfer the cooked steak[s] to a plate to rest for a few min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak with the kachumbari salad and viazi karai-style potatoes to the side

Dollop the tamarind chutney over the steak

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
