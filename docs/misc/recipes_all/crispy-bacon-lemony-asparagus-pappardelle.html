<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cook the pasta for an initial 7 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pasta has been cooking for 7 min, add the halved asparagus and sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until just tender

Once tender, drain and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pot to a medium heat, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter and a generous drizzle of olive oil, then give everything a good mix up until the butter has melted

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and add half the chopped basil with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add a splash of the starchy pasta water and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the crispy bacon from the oven and chop it roughly with a sharp knife

Add the chopped bacon to the pot, give everything another good mix and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your crispy bacon & lemony asparagus linguine

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy bacon & lemony asparagus linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and chopped basil

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
