<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a pot over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Squeeze your sausage meat from the skins into the pan (clean hands is the best way!) and discard the skins

Break the sausage meat up into large bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and cook for 5 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sausage meat is cooking, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and chop into chunks

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Once browned, add the onion wedges, carrot discs and chopped leek to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the veg is softening, cut your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the veg is beginning to soften, add the chopped potato and chopped garlic with your cider vinegar and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chicken stock to the pot with the thyme leaves, your bay leaf[ves] and Henderson's Relish and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the veg is tender and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Irish-style coddle sausage & potato stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted and crispy

Once toasted, spread a generous knob of butter over the toasted ciabatta – this is your crispy buttered ciabatta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Irish-style coddle sausage & potato stew with the crispy buttered ciabatta to the side and discard the bay leaf[ves]

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
