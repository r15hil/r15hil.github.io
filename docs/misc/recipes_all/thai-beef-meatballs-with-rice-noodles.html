<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the beef mince, chopped ginger, coriander stems, fish sauce and half the red curry paste in a mixing bowl


Mix thoroughly until everything is fully combined (use clean hands!)


Divide the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and shape into balls


Refrigerate until later&nbsp;

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the Thai rice noodles to a pot of salted boiled water (enough to cover them) on a high heat


Boil for 4-6 min, or until they're cooked through but with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and rinse them briefly under cold water, shaking off the excess water before returning them to the pot</p><br><br>

Combine the toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, lime juice and remaining red curry paste and mix together thoroughly - this is your Thai dressing


Chop or crush the roasted peanuts coarsely


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely&nbsp;</p><br><br>

Tip: use tongs to turn them regularly for even cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Once warmed, remove them from the heat and stir in the chopped spring onion, coriander leaves and roasted peanuts


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
