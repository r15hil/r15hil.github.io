<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Wash, then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop the white base into large, rough pieces and set aside the green tops

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite, then drain and transfer them to a large bowl and set aside

Reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the noodles are cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine 3/4 of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped ginger, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and the juice of your lime[s] – this is your sriracha dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pak choi white base with the chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Add the pak choi tops and give everything a good mix up until they're wilted

Transfer the cooked pak choi to the bowl with the noodles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your haddock bites to a large bowl with the remaining soy sauce and give them a good mix up until well coated

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Add your cornflour and mix until fully combined, then sprinkle over your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated haddock bites and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy chilli haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Dress the pak choi & noodles in the sriracha dressing – these are your pak choi noodles

Serve the crispy chilli haddock over the pak choi noodles

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
