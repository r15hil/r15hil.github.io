<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid and cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands and cook for 3-4 min or until the mushrooms have browned

While the mushrooms are browning, chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your quick cook spaghetti and halved Tenderstem to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until everything is cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti & Tenderstem, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add your roasted garlic paste to the pan with your tomato paste and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your sun-dried tomato pesto, soft cheese and vegetable stock mix to the pan with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti & Tenderstem to the pan and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the sauce

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your creamy tomato, mushroom & broccoli spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato, mushroom & broccoli spaghetti with the cooked chicken to the side

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
