Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the steaks are cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix and marmite in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock

Once the onion has caramelised, add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for a further 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your onion gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested pork steak finely

Serve the sliced pork steak with the roast apple & potatoes and spring greens to the side

Pour the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
