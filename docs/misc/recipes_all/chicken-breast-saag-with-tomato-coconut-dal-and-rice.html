<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle, then add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with a generous pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomatoes into wedges

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and creamed coconut in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[780ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add your ground turmeric and curry powder and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water, then add them to the pot with the coconut stock

Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat, and cook for 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender and starting to break down

Once tender, add the tomato wedges to the pot and cook for 5 min further or until the tomatoes have softened and the lentils are fully cooked – this is your tomato & coconut dal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Meanwhile, add your diced chicken breast, garam masala, ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of salt to a bowl and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken breast and remaining sliced onion and cook for 8-10 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it finely

Once the chicken is cooked, add the chopped spinach to the pan and cook for 2 min or until warmed through – this is your chicken breast saag</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken breast saag and tomato & coconut dal alongside the basmati rice

Garnish with the toasted coconut flakes

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
