<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips

Add the chunky chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, combine the cornflour and ground turmeric with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your cornflour mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through, golden and crisp – these are your homemade fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the sliced mangetout and blanched peas to a pot, covering them with boiled water until fully submerged and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2 min or until tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the peas and mangetout are tender, drain them and return them to the pot with a knob of butter and the chopped mint

Stir it all together – this is your minted veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the homemade fish fingers with the chunky chips, minted veg and ketchup to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
