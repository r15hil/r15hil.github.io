<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] and potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Slice half your chilli[es] finely into rounds (you'll use the rest later!)

Zest your lime[s], and cut in half

Peel your garlic

Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger">[1 1/2tsp]</span> [2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl with the juice of half the lime[s] and the chilli rounds and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the remaining chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the peeled garlic to a food processor with the lime zest, ground smoked paprika, ground turmeric, creamed coconut, ginger paste and the juice of the remaining lime

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your coconut marinade

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the ingredients and grind to a paste in a pestle & mortar instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your mayo to a bowl with half the coconut marinade (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sunshine mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice through the thickest part of your chicken breast portion[s], being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book, cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

Add the butterflied chicken to a large bowl with the remaining coconut marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coconut marinated chicken and cook for 6 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy coconut chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your gluten free brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Wash your baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed brioche with a handful of baby leaf salad, the spicy coconut chicken, a dollop of sunshine mayo and the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserve the pickling liquid from the pickled chilli

Serve the remaining baby leaf salad with a drizzle of olive oil and the reserved pickling liquid and set the fries and any remaining sunshine mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
