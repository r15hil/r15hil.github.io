<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the wedges are cooking, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Add the chopped shallot to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, dried sage, a large knob of butter and 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your sage & onion stuffing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the wedges have had 10 min, add the sage & onion stuffing to one side of the tray[s]

Tip: Smaller pieces of stuffing will crisp up more!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15-20 min or until the wedges are golden and the stuffing is beginning to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Carefully slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble your sarnie by filling up the warmed ciabatta with a dollop of mayo, a handful of salad, the pulled chicken, sage & onion stuffing and some spiced plum chutney – this is your chicken & stuffing sarnie

Serve the chicken & stuffing sarnies with the remaining salad, cherry tomato halves and potato wedges to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
