<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half

Combine the mayo, chopped garlic (not a raw garlic fan? Try using less) and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon in a small bowl

Season with both salt and pepper, add a drizzle of olive oil and whisk to combine – this is your aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped parsley and panko breadcrumbs to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and mix it up – these are your herby breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice the basa fillets in half lengthways, then slice each half into 3 until you end up with 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> fish fingers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> flour to another plate

Add half of the fish fingers to the flour (tap off any excess), add them to the beaten egg, then put them into the bowl of herby breadcrumbs and give them a good mix up until they're fully coated

Repeat this process with the rest of the fish – these are your herby fish fingers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Add the blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiling water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Once tender, drain the peas and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the herby fish fingers and cook for 4-5 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through (you may have to do this in batches)

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the herby fish fingers with the chips and peas to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and the aioli for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
