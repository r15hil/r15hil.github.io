<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork & beef mince with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the mince is starting to brown, add the onion wedges, chopped tomato, sliced garlic, tomato paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your macaroni, beef stock mix, grated cheese, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk and 350ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span> [650ml]</span> boiled water

Nestle the pasta into the water as much as you can, then stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta and beef are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the pasta is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and top with your grated Italian hard cheese

Return the dish to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 2 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your one-pot pork & beef 'cheeseburger' macaroni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot pork & beef 'cheeseburger' macaroni

Drizzle over your tomato ketchup and mustard ketchup

Serve the baby leaf salad to the side
