<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the garlic is fragrant, add the tomato paste and cook for 1 min further

After 1 min, add the Chinese rice wine, vegetable stock and drained chickpeas to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, add 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> rosemary sprig<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (save the rest for another recipe!) and cook for 4-5 min or until the chickpeas are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once tender, remove the rosemary and mash half the chickpeas

Season with half the cracked black pepper (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt, give everything a good stir and cook for a further 1 min or until the sauce begins to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tortelloni to the pan with half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce - this is your chickpea & tomato sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chickpea & tomato sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni in bowls

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and cracked black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
