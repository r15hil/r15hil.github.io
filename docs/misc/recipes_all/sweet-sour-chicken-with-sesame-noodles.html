<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil a kettle

Cut your chicken breast strips into thinner strips

Combine your honey, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> of sugar, tamarind paste and soy sauce in a mixing bowl, then divide the marinade into 2 separate bowls, add the chicken strips to one bowl of the marinade and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (keep the leaves and stalks separate!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and finely chop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and mix to combine

Add the marinated chicken strips to the cornflour and give everything a good mix up until well coated

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken strips and fry for 5-6 min on each side, or until crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside – this is your sweet & sour chicken

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the remaining marinade and softened noodles to the pan, give everything a good mix and cook for 1 min further until warmed through – these are your sesame noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet & sour chicken over the sesame noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
