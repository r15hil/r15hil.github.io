<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the shallot wedges and sliced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the veg is softening, dissolve your beef stock mix, tomato paste and red wine paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[420ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red wine stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the carrot and onion has slightly softened, add your beef mince to the pan with your bay leaf[ves] and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add the chopped garlic and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the red wine stock with a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef & red wine stew

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the cooked potatoes to a low heat with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your horseradish sauce (not a big horseradish fan? Try using less!) and mash until smooth – this is your horseradish mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beef & red wine stew over the horseradish mash, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Season with a grind of black pepper and garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
