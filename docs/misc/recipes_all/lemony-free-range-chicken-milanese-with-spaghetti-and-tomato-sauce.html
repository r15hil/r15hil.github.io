<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Cover your free range chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and approx. 1cm in thickness</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your panko breadcrumbs with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt on a large plate

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Add the lemon zest to the breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up – these are your lemony breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of the lemon[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then stir it all together

Dip the flattened chicken in the lemon & olive oil, then press into the lemony breadcrumbs until both sides are well coated

Add the coated chicken to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lemony free range chicken Milanese</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is cooking, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving the pot

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the spinach and cook for 1-2 min or until wilted

Drain off any excess liquid and season with a pinch of salt

Stir the chopped basil into the tomato sauce

Slice the lemony free range chicken Milanese on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato sauce over the spaghetti with the sliced lemony free range chicken Milanese on top and the wilted spinach to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
