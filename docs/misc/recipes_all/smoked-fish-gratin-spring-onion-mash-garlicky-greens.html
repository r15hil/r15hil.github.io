Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your smoked basa fillet[s] to an oven-proof dish and pour over the mustard béchamel sauce

Scatter your grated cheese and panko breadcrumbs over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until it's golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your smoked basa gratin

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain then return the potatoes to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<p>In a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), heat a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chopped garlic, blanched peas and sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until cooked with a slight bite – these are your garlicky greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

Add the sliced spring onions and give it a good mix up – this is your spring onion mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, serve the smoked basa gratin with the spring onion mash and garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
