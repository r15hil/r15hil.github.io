<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers of the lemongrass and set aside for later

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and lemongrass core[s] to the dish and cook for 1-2 min or until the mushrooms are lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Add the onion wedges to the dish with your ginger & garlic paste, soy sauce, tamarind paste, pho broth paste, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of sugar and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water

Stir everything together and bring to the boil, then cover and put in the oven for 25-30 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the stew is in the oven, add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with the outer lemongrass layers, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your fragrant baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the rice has 15 min left, add your mangetout to a large piece of tin foil with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the foil around the mangetout to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (Cooking for more than 3? Make 2 separate parcels!)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the mangetout are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the stew is cooked, discard the lemongrass core[s]

Use two forks to gently shred apart the Fable mushrooms – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Stir the pulled Fable mushrooms through the sauce – this is your Vietnamese-style Fable mushroom & lemongrass stew

Cover and leave the stew to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Vietnamese-style Fable mushroom & lemongrass stew, fragrant baked rice and mangetout

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and scatter over the stew
