<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Slice your red chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped onion and chopped tomato to the dish with the chopped potato and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your curry powder with your garam masala and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[550ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste, ginger & garlic paste and your vegetable stock mix

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 25-30 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Fable mushroom aloo gosht</p><br><br>

<p>Reboil the kettle

Add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, drizzle your natural yoghurt over the Fable mushroom aloo gosht and dollop on your mango chutney

Scatter over the remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the basmati rice to the side

Dig in!</p><br><br>
