<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

On a clean board, chop your chicken breast strips into smaller strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your chopped chicken and sliced pepper to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until browned and almost cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add your roasted garlic paste and dried oregano to the pan with your ground smoked paprika, chipotle paste and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

<span class="text-danger">Ordered extra halloumi? Slice and cook in a pan with a little oil for 4-6 min or until golden all over</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked rice, chicken stock and the juice of half your lemon[s] and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the liquid has absorbed and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken & pepper rice

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the peri peri chicken & pepper rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
