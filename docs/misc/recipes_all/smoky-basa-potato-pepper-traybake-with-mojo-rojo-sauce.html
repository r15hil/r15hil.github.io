<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop (keep the colours separate!)

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potato and chopped yellow pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with the onion wedges, half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min – these are your roasted veggies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are roasting, add the chopped red pepper to a separate, tin foil-lined baking tray, then scrunch the sides up to create a parcel

Add the peeled garlic, ground cumin, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the parcel and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the pepper is softened and golden – this is your roasted pepper mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim your green beans

Cut the trimmed green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat the basa fillet[s] dry with the kitchen paper, then evenly sprinkle the remaining ground smoked paprika over the fish – this is your smoky basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] with the roasted veggies from the oven and add the chopped green beans and smoky basa with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your smoky basa, potato & pepper traybake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
