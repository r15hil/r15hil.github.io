<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over the highest heat

Once your pan is very hot, add the beef strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min exactly, to sear the outside, but prevent them from overcooking

Once browned, transfer the beef strips to a plate to rest (it’s okay if they’re a little pink on the inside, they’ll go back in the sauce later) and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the beef is browned, peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16] </span>wedges

Separate the onion wedges into petals

Top, tail and chop the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into batons</p><br><br>

Tip: Add a splash more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
