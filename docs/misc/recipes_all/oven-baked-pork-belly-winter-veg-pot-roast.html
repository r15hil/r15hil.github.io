<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned pork belly, fat side down and cook for 4 min or until coloured and crispy, flip and cook for 2 min on the other side then remove from the dish and set aside

Reserve the dish</p><br><br>

<p>Reduce the heat to medium, add the chopped carrot and parsnip to the dish with your dried sage, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and your beef stock mix

Give everything a good mix up, then add 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water with your Henderson's Relish and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, return the crispy pork belly to the dish, skin-side up, then put in the oven, uncovered, for 45 min, or until the pork is cooked through and the vegetables are tender</p><br><br>
