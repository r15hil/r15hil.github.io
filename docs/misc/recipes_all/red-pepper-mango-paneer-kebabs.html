<p><strong>Description:</strong> Paneer is a mild Indian cheese, similar in texture to halloumi, but without the saltiness. It has an extremely high melting point, which means you can grill and heat it without it melting, making it perfect for kebabs and barbecues! We've served these with a mango chutney dressing, toasted rice and salad. </p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat


Once hot, add the skewers and cook for 10-12 min or until charred, turning regularly&nbsp;(alternatively grill the skewers on a high heat for the same amount of time)


Tip:&nbsp;cover the skewers with a heavy pan whilst they cook, this applies pressure so they colour and also steam

Serve the skewers over the toasted rice, with the salad to the side and drizzle all over with the mango dressing
