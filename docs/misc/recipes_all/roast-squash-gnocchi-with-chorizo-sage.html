<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Strip your sage leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Add half the sage leaves (you'll use the rest later!) to a baking paper-lined baking tray with your gnocchi and your butternut squash cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to the tray with a grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in oil

Drizzle half your balsamic vinegar over the butternut squash

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the butternut squash is tender and the gnocchi is crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once crisped, stir through your double cream with a grind of pepper, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside until the gnocchi is ready</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi and squash are ready, remove the tray from the oven

Add the roast gnocchi & butternut squash (reserve the crispy sage for garnish!) to the pan and mix everything together – this is your roast squash gnocchi with chorizo & sage

Return the pan to a very low heat for 1 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add a drizzle of olive oil to the lettuce with the remaining balsamic vinegar and toss – this is your salad

Serve the roast squash gnocchi with chorizo & sage with the salad to the side

Garnish with the crispy sage

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
