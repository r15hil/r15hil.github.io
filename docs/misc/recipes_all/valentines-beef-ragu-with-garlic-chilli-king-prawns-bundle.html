<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ gas 5 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced beef and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

Peel and slice your brown onion[s], peel and finely chop (or grate) half your garlic (save the rest for later!) and grate your chestnut mushrooms

Once the beef is browned, add the sliced onion with the chopped garlic, grated mushroom and a knob of butter and cook for 3 min further, then add your beef stock mix with 400ml<span class="text-purple"> [520ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [680ml] </span>boiled water, your tomato paste and Henderson's Relish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 1hr 15 min – this is your beef & mushroom ragù

While the ragù is in the oven, boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once done, drain and return to the pot

Return the pot to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and season with a pinch of salt, then mash until smooth and set aside to reheat later - this is your mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed and chop finely, then peel and finely slice (don’t chop!) the remaining garlic, then chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Slice your ciabatta[s], then add to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until lightly toasted

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>and once hot, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced garlic and half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – this is your garlic & chilli prawns starter

While the ragù is still cooking, enjoy the garlic & chilli prawns starter in a sharing dish with the toasted ciabatta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the beef & mushroom ragù has had 60 min, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water, then put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until tender, golden and crisp

Once ready, remove the beef & mushroom ragù from the oven and leave to stand for a couple of min before serving

Return the mash to a low heat with a splash of milk and half your grated Italian hard cheese and cook for 2 min or until the mash is warmed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mash with the roasted Tenderstem broccoli to the side and spoon over the beef & mushroom ragù

Sprinkle over the remaining parsley and grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
