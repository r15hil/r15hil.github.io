<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and half your shichimi togarashi (save the rest for later!)

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish, draining away half of the juices

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add your mooli slaw mix to a bowl with the chopped parsley, half your toasted sesame seeds (save the rest for later!), rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Mix it all together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After an initial 30 min, remove the pulled pork dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the BBQ pulled pork apart using two forks, then add the teriyaki sauce and stir it all together

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed and the pork has started to crisp – this is your teriyaki pulled pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the halved brioche, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining toasted sesame seeds in a bowl – this is your sesame sriracha mayo

Once golden and crispy, sprinkle the remaining shichimi togarashi over the potatoes – these are your togarashi potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread a dollop of sesame sriracha mayo onto the toasted brioche base, then top with the teriyaki pulled pork, a handful of quick-pickled slaw and a toasted brioche lid – this is your pulled pork teriyaki burger

Serve the pulled pork teriyaki burger with the togarashi potatoes and remaining quick-pickled slaw and sesame sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
