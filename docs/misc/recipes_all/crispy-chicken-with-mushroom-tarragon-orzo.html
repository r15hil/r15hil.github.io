<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chicken thighs to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the orzo is cooked, stir half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and all the grated cheese through the orzo

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mushroom & parsley orzo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom & parsley orzo topped with the crispy chicken

Season with a generous grind of black pepper, garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle with some olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
