<p><strong>Description:</strong> Thai flavours should be fresh, aromatic and lively. Our pork skewers are even barbecue friendly; the pork is coated in our zingy Thai curry paste and then skewered. Donâ€™t fear achieving a really dark, charred colour with the pork, as this brings out the most flavour. </p>
