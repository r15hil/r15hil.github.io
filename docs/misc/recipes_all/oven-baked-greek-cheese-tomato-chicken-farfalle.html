<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips to the dish and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Add your cherry tomatoes to the dish with your balsamic sundried tomato paste, tomato paste, dried basil, crushed garlic and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Tip: Nestle the farfalle into the stock as much as you can for even cooking!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish to the oven, covered, and cook for a final 15-20 min or until the pasta is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your oven baked Greek cheese, tomato & chicken farfalle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the oven baked Greek cheese, tomato & chicken farfalle seasoned with a generous pinch of pepper
