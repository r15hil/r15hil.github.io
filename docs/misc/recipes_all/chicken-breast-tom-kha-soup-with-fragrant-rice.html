<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan (they'll go back in the sauce later, so don't worry if they aren't fully cooked yet!)

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, then remove the tough outer layer[s] and set aside for later and chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Rinse then add your white long grain rice, tough outer lemongrass layer[s] and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely, then chop the creamed coconut roughly

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and the chopped creamed coconut in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water – this is your stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped lemongrass, chopped ginger, sliced mushrooms and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the stock with the reserved chicken breast portion[s] and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, pick your coriander leaves from their stalks

Chop the coriander stalks finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good stir – this is your chicken breast tom kha soup

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Discard the outer lemongrass layers from the cooked rice

Serve the chicken breast tom kha soup with the cooked rice

Garnish with the coriander leaves, chopped coriander stalks and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
