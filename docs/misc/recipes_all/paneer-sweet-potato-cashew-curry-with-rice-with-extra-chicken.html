<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid then, cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces, then add to a bowl with your cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, add the coated paneer to the pan with your cashews and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into small pieces, then add to a heatproof bowl, cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top, put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 4-5 min or until fork-tender

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix to the pan with your chopped tomatoes

Add a generous pinch of sugar and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the curry is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the paneer, sweet potato & cashew curry over the cooked brown rice with the cooked chicken to the side

Chop your coriander roughly over the curry with scissors

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
