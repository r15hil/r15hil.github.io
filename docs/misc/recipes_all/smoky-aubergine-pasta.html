<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the tahini, 200ml <span class="text-danger">(300ml)</span> of pasta water and the garlic to the aubergine already in the processor


Tip: Using the starchy pasta water helps to bind the sauce


Blitz everything until you reach the consistency of a chunky dip-this is your baba ganoush</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set aside half of the onions and toss the pasta and baba ganoush through the remaining onions in the pan, and season generously with salt and pepper


Plate and top with the remaining aubergine pieces and onions, toasted walnuts, chopped dill and nigella seeds


Serve with lemon wedges and enjoy!</p><br><br>
