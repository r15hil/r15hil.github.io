<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix

Cook for 3-4 min or until the mince is browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains, then add to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice and meat-free mince are piping hot – this is your Thai-style meat-free mince rice with mangetout</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style meat-free mince rice with mangetout and garnish with the reserved chopped basil, a lime wedge and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
