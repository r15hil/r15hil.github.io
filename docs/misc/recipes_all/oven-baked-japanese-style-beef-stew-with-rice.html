<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Add your diced beef to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour, stir it all together, and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the beef is browning, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs (no need to peel!)

Peel and chop your potato[es] (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the onion wedges to the dish with the chopped carrot, chopped potatoes and garlic and stir it all together

Add your beef stock mix, 400ml <span class="text-purple">[550ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 55 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the stew has been cooking for 25 min, reboil a kettle and add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 55 min, add your mirin, soy sauce, ginger paste and mangetout to the stew

Stir it all together, cover with the lid and return to the oven for a final 5 min or until the mangetout are tender with a slight bite – this is your oven-baked Japanese-style beef stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the oven-baked Japanese-style beef stew with the baked rice to the side

Sprinkle your shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) all over the top
