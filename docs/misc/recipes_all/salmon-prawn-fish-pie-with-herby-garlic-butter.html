<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 6-7 min or until beginning to soften

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your dill and chives finely, keeping them separate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once the onion has started to soften, add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] and a generous grind of black pepper, then give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain your king prawns

Once thickened, stir in your salmon flakes, drained king prawns, blanched peas and chopped dill

Cook for 1-2 min further until fully combined – this is your fish pie mix

Transfer the fish pie mix to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Mash the drained potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Don't worry if you're left with a crumbly mixture, this helps add texture to your topping!

Top the fish pie mix evenly with the mashed potatoes and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the topping is lightly golden – this is your salmon & king prawn fish pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the fish pie cooks, add the chopped chives, remaining chopped garlic and 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 1/2 tbsp] </span>butter to a bowl

Use a fork to mix everything together evenly by pressing the mixture against the bowl – this is your herby garlic butter

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish pie has been cooking for 15 min, reboil half a kettle

Trim, then add your green beans to a pot (use the mash pot to save on washing up!)

Cover them with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once done, drain the beans, return them to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the salmon & king prawn fish pie from the oven and spoon the herby garlic butter all over the top, then leave to stand for 5 min before serving

Tip: Cooling it slightly helps the sauce to thicken up and will let the herby garlic butter melt all over!

Serve the salmon & king prawn fish pie with the green beans and a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
