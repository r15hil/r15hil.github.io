<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil a kettle

Peel and dice your brown onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat, once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-6 min or until soft and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the wholewheat spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the spaghetti is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Cut your chicken breast strips into large, bite-sized pieces on a clean board

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika, Dijon mustard and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl, then add the chicken pieces, mix well and set aside – this is your smoky chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high

Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped garlic and season generously with salt and pepper

Cook for 1-2 min or until the mushrooms start to soften and brown slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Increase the heat to high and add the smoky chicken with half the chopped parsley to the pan (save the rest for garnish!)

Cook for a further 4-5 min or until the chicken is beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water

Add the stock to the pan and reduce the heat to medium-high, then cook for a further 6-8 min or until the liquid has reduced by half and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the pan

Tip: Stir very thoroughly as this will release the starch in the pasta and make the sauce naturally creamy

Before the liquid has fully reduced, remove the spaghetti from the heat and stir in your soft cheese – this is your smoky chicken & mushroom spaghetti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chicken & mushroom spaghetti

Garnish with the remaining parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
