<p><strong>Description:</strong> The combination of pork and fennel seed is famed in Italian cuisine - for good reason. Fennel seeds have a sweet and anise-like taste, which seasons the pork beautifully, making for a more complex flavour. Al Forno translates to 'oven-baked', which is what this melty pasta dish is. </p>
