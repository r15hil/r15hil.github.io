<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Slice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped ginger and garlic with your chilli flakes, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce and half of your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your chilli paste</p><br><br>

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the prawns are almost cooked, add the chilli paste and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the prawns are cooked through and coated – this is your spicy chilli king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped mint, chopped coriander and sliced spring onion to the cooked brown rice with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your herby rice

Combine the remaining rice vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herby rice with the shredded lettuce to the side and drizzle with the dressing

Top with the spicy chilli king prawns and mango slices

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
