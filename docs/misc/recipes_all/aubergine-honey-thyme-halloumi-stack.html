<h4>Step 1</h4>

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim the green stalks off the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and discard, then cut into 6 [12] discs

Tip: Cut the slices of the narrow end slightly wider than that of the fatter end to maintain even cooking

Pat the halloumi dry with kitchen paper then cut into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> even slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the aubergine slices to a large baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up then put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the aubergine is soft and golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

Strip the thyme leaves from their stalks and chop the leaves finely (reserve a few leaves for garnish!)

Combine the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon with the honey, chopped thyme, chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your honey-thyme dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2 min on each side or until starting to brown

Add half of the honey-thyme dressing to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further on each side until the halloumi is sticky and caramelised

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Fluff the drained bulgur wheat with a fork then add the sultanas, rocket and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> honey-thyme dressing and gently mix – this is your bulgur salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the halloumi and aubergine slices are cool enough to touch, thread them evenly onto the skewers – these are your aubergine and honey-thyme halloumi stacks

Slice the remaining lemon into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the aubergine & honey-thyme halloumi stacks over the bulgur salad

Drizzle over any remaining honey-thyme dressing and garnish with the reserved thyme leaves and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
