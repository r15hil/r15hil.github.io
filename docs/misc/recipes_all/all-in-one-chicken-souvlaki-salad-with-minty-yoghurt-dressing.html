<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your baking tray and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chopped veg and chicken thighs to a baking tray (or two!) with your mediterranean-style seasoning, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together until well coated and arrange the chicken thighs so they are on top of the vegetables (skin side up)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender – this is your souvlaki-style chicken & roasted veg</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut your lemon[s] in half

Add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with your mint sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice and give everything a good mix – this is your minty yoghurt dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted veg over the shredded lettuce and top with the roasted chicken

Drizzle with the minty yoghurt dressing – this is your all-in-one chicken souvlaki-style salad with minty yoghurt dressing
