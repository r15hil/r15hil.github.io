<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy bacon & pea sauce with fresh orecchiette</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy bacon & pea sauce with fresh orecchiette topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese
