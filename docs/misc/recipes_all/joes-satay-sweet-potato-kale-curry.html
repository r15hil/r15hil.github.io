<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the sweet potato is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Rinse your red lentils, then add them to the pan with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the lentils are cooked and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander roughly including the stalks, keeping the stalks separate from the leaves

Chop your lime[s] in half and wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the lentils are cooked, add the shredded kale to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 3-5 min or until the kale has wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the kale has wilted, add your peanut butter with the chopped coriander stalks (save the chopped leaves for garnish!) and the juice of half the lime[s] and stir it all together – this is your satay kale curry

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted sweet potato over the satay kale curry

Finish with a dollop of your natural yoghurt

Garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, roasted peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
