<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the cornflour in a large bowl with the curry powder, ground turmeric, vegetable stock mix, a small pinch of salt and 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, spoon the tofu pakora mix into the pan, roughly divided into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crisp – these are your tofu pakoras

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the grated ginger and chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor with the chopped coriander & mint

Add the mayo, mango chutney, cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your chilli chutney mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine 1/3 of the chilli chutney mayo (save the rest for later!) with the carrot & cabbage slaw mix in a large bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli chutney slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tofu pakoras with the chilli chutney slaw, fries and remaining chilli chutney mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
