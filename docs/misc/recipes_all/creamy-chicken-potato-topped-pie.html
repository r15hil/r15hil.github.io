<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are boiling, add your chicken breast strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), then reboil half a kettle

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail and dice your carrot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and Dijon mustard in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [425ml]</span> boiled water

Once the vegetables have softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the vegetable stock and soft cheese, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a small splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the pulled chicken to the sauce with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy chicken pie filling

Transfer the creamy chicken pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the mash

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your creamy chicken potato-topped pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your shredded kale then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non- stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, add the shredded kale and remaining chopped garlic, then return to the heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your garlicky greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken potato-topped pie with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!
