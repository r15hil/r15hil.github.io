<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Add the pumpkin seeds to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a high heat

Once hot, roughly crumble the chestnut mushrooms into the pan, add the roasted garlic paste and cook for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium, then add the Chinese rice wine, crème fraîche and half of the goats' cheese (you will use the rest for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a grind of pepper

Stir it all together until the sauce begins to stick to the spaghetti – this is your goats' cheese & mushroom spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the goats' cheese & mushroom spaghetti

Crumble the remaining goats' cheese all over, top with the toasted pumpkin seeds and a few cracks of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
