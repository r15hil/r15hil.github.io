<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cook for 20-25 min or until tender but with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the ground allspice in a large mixing bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> each of salt and pepper, then add the chicken thighs and coat thoroughly

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer the chicken thighs to a baking tray and reserve the pan for step 6

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, boil half a kettle

Chop the dried cranberries coarsely

Add them to a bowl and cover with enough boiled water to cover completely (this helps them become juicy and plump)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the blanched almonds to a separate tray, drizzle them with a little olive oil and place them in the oven for 5 min or until slightly darkened in colour

Once done, remove from the oven and sprinkle with salt

Leave them to cool on the tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the nuts are cooling, peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat, once hot, add the chopped shallot

Cook for 2-3 min, then add the cooked freekeh, coating all the grains in the oil

Remove from the heat and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Strip the mint leaves and dill leaves from their stalks and chop finely

Crumble the feta

Chop the cooled almonds coarsely

Drain the cranberries

Finely slice the cooked chicken thighs</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the drained cranberries, almonds, mint, dill and feta to the freekeh with a drizzle of olive oil and the white wine vinegar and mix gently to combine – this is your jewelled freekeh

Serve the sliced chicken over the jewelled freekeh

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
