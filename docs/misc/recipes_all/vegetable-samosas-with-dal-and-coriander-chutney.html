<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced potato, grated carrot and half the diced onion (save the rest for later!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until everything is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once beginning to soften, add your blanched peas, half your curry powder, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2 squares per person, then add the vegetable samosa mix to one corner of each pastry square and fold the corner over to make a triangle shape

Crimp the edges with a fork to seal each samosa, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two) and put in the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your vegetable samosas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the remaining diced onion, chopped garlic and half the chopped ginger (save the rest for later!) to the pot and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the rinsed red lentils, remaining curry powder and vegetable stock mix to the pot with 450ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[750ml] </span>boiled water

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the dal is cooking, grind the chopped herbs and remaining ginger in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste

Add your white wine vinegar, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil to the paste and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney

Combine your tamarind paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your tamarind sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir half your cultured coconut into the dal with a generous grind of black pepper and serve in a bowl

Serve the vegetable samosas to the side with the coriander chutney, tamarind sauce and remaining cultured coconut

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
