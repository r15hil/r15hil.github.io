<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into quarters, leaving the skins and roots on (this stops them drying out and falling apart when roasting)</p><br><br>

Drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper
