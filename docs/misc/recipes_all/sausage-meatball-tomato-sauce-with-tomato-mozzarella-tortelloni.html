<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Roll the sausage meat into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> meatballs (clean hands are the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook, turning occasionally, for 4-5 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve the chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are starting to brown, add the sliced garlic, dried oregano and dried basil to the pan and cook for 30 secs further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained tortelloni and half the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!) into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is nicely coated – this is your sausage meatball & tomato sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage meatball & tomato sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni topped with the grated Italian hard cheese and remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
