<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Chop your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and chopped mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has begun to soften, add the chopped garlic, half the thyme leaves (you'll use the rest later!) and your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Reduce the heat to medium and add your chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your mushroom risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bash your hazelnuts in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil in a bowl with a pinch of pepper – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the crushed hazelnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, transfer the toasted hazelnuts to a plate, reserve the pan and carefully wipe with some kitchen paper (it will be hot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!), break it up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and cook for 5-6 min or until browned all over

Once browned, add your red wine stock paste with a small splash of cold water and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sausage is fully cooked and coated in the glaze (no pink meat!) – this is your red wine glazed sausage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is cooked, add your grated Italian hard cheese and remaining cider vinegar and give everything a good mix up

Stir through the red wine glazed sausage – this is your mushroom & red wine glazed sausage risotto

Toss the salad in the dressing – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom & red wine glazed sausage risotto with the dressed salad to the side

Garnish with the toasted hazelnuts, remaining thyme leaves and a generous crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
