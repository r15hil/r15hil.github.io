<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic, ginger, sliced spring greens, carrot and spring onions to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Reduce the heat to low and add the soy sauce and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>
