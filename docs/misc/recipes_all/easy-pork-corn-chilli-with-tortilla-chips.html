<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the tortillas into triangles (layer them up for speedy chopping!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Lightly oil a baking tray, then add the tortilla triangles (you may need two trays if they're crowded) and a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 7-9 min or until golden and crisp

Once done, remove from the oven and set aside – these are your tortilla chips

Tip: Watch the chips like a hawk, or they may burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the tortilla chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the turkey mince and cook for 4 min or until crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon up as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Dissolve the chicken stock mix, tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Drain and rinse the sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the turkey mince is crisp, add the smoked paprika, ground coriander, ground cumin and cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once done, add the chipotle stock and drained sweetcorn to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 5-7 min or until you have a thick stew-like consistency

Season very generously with black pepper – this is your turkey & corn chilli</p><br><br>

Trim and slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Garnish the turkey & corn chilli with the grated cheese and the sliced spring onion

Serve the tortilla chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
