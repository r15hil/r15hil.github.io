<p><strong>Description:</strong> Walnuts are full of heart-healthy fats, so we've used them twice. First, you'll sprinkle them on chicken breasts for delicious crunch. Then whizz them up in a pesto and stir into quinoa and butter beans.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add the walnuts to a pestle & mortar and bash into a coarse powder (or pulse in a food processor)

Rub the chicken breasts with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and add them to a baking tray

Top the chicken with half the bashed walnuts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the walnut crust is golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 180ml <span class="text-danger">[360ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the quinoa is cooking, chop the green beans in half

Once the quinoa has been cooking for 10-12 min, add the halved green beans and a splash more water and cook, covered, for 5-6 min further until the quinoa is cooked and the green beans are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop the basil, including the stalks

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Add the chopped basil and garlic to the pestle and mortar with the remaining walnuts and grind to a paste – this is your walnut pesto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the butter beans and wash the spinach

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Once hot, add the drained butter beans and washed spinach with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has started to wilt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked quinoa and green beans to the pan

Add the walnut pesto, crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube, add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [280ml]</span> boiled water and the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon and give it a good mix up

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until warmed through – these are your basily butter beans

Finely slice the cooked walnut-crusted chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the sliced walnut-crusted chicken over the basily butter beans and the lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
