<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, boil a kettle

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [340ml] </span>boiled water

Drain and rinse your green lentils</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the carrot, bay leaf[ves], drained green lentils and vegetable stock to the pan

Cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the carrots are tender, stirring occasionally – this is your lentil stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your lemon[s]

Slice the remaining non-zested lemon into wedges

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine in a bowl your panko breadcrumbs, chopped parsley, lemon zest and grated cheese

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon breadcrumb mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your cod fillet[s] to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and top with the lemon breadcrumb mixture

Once the stew has 10 min left, put the tray[s] in the oven for 12 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden and the cod is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once the carrots are tender, squeeze in the juice of the zested lemon

Add a knob of butter and season with a good grind of black pepper

Serve the lemon-crusted cod over the lentil stew and garnish with a lemon wedge and the reserved parsley leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
