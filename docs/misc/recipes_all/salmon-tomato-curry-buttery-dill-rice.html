<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Add the salmon fillets (skin-side up) to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through once it's opaque and flakes easily!

Once cooked, peel the skin off the salmon and discard</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the curry powder, chopped garlic, ginger paste and tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the tomatoes start to break down

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and chopped creamed coconut in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further until thickened slightly

Once thickened, add the cooked salmon to the pan, and spoon the sauce over – this is your salmon & tomato curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, add a knob of butter, the chopped dill and season generously with salt and pepper – this is your dill rice

Serve the salmon & tomato curry over the dill rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
