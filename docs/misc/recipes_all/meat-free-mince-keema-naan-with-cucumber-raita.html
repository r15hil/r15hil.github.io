<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Put 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> large baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven to heat up (this will stop the base of your naan from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then combine with the red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the naans are in the oven, cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add the grated cucumber, natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free mince keema naans with a dollop of cucumber raita

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot
