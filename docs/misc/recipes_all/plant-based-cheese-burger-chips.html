<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the patties are in the oven, add your mayo to a bowl with your chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then stir through your white wine vinegar – this is your burger sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the patties are cooked, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice – these are your cheezy meat-free patties

Slice your brioche buns in half and add them to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese flavour slice has melted and the plant-based brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the shredded lettuce to a bowl with half of the burger sauce (save the rest for later!) and give it a good mix up – this is your lettuce slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each warmed brioche bun with a spoonful of lettuce slaw, a cheezy meat-free patty and the cucumber rounds – these are your plant-based cheezeburgers

Serve the chips, remaining lettuce leaves and remaining burger sauce to the side

Drizzle the lettuce leaves with olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
