<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season the skin with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the sea bass, skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Transfer the cooked sea bass to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<p>Once your sauce has thickened, add the drained noodles to the pan with half the sliced spring onion (you’ll use the rest later!) and the wilted pak choi and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles and pak choi are warmed through

Season with a generous grind of pepper – these are your Szechuan-style noodles</p><br><br>
