<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Chop them in one bunch for speed!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your mangetout to a bowl and cover them in boiled water until fully submerged

Set aside to soften

Combine your soy sauce, honey and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl – this is your teriyaki sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your basa fillet[s] to the pan and cook for an initial 4 min on each side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the teriyaki sauce and half the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further on each side or until the basa is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your teriyaki basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, drain the softened mangetout and return to the bowl

Add your toasted sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the teriyaki basa with the cooked rice and sesame greens on the side

Garnish with the remaining spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
