<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil

Add the ground paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and top with a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to a baking tray lined with tin foil

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the corn is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat

Whilst the chicken is browning, add the saffron to 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> hot water and set aside to infuse – this is your saffron liquid</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned chicken to the baking tray with the cobettes and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to rest before slicing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Once hot add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until caramelised

Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly and roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface and cut into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped coriander, natural yogurt, saffron liquid and a squeeze of lime juice

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander & saffron yogurt

Once the onion has caramelised, add the balsamic vinegar with a pinch of brown sugar and cook for 1-2 min further or until the vinegar has been absorbed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the caramelised onion to the cooked rice and mix it all together – this is your caramelised onion rice

Serve the cumin chicken over the caramelised onion rice with the spiced cobettes to the side

Drizzle over the coriander & saffron yogurt and garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
