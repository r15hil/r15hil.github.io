<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had 12 min, remove the dish from the oven and top with your grated cheese and chopped pepperoni

Return the dish to the oven and cook for a further 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted, the pepperoni has crisped and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy pepperoni chicken

Combine the salad, sliced cucumber and your balsamic vinegar in a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the cheesy pepperoni chicken from the dish and give the tomato sauce a good mix up

Serve the cheesy pepperoni chicken over the tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
