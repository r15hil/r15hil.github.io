<p><strong>Description:</strong> You'll use our mild goats' cheese two ways for this deliciously indulgent yet fabulously easy linguine dish. You'll stir it into a tomato and spinach sauce for tantalising creaminess. You'll then coat the rest of the cheese in a mix of black and white sesame seeds to top the pasta. So easy, so quick, so good!</p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the tomato sauce from the heat and stir in half of your goats' cheese – this is your tomato & goats' cheese sauce

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds onto a chopping board and roll the remaining goats' cheese in the seeds to coat and reserve for garnish</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the linguine & spinach to the tomato & goats' cheese sauce and mix until the linguine is coated – this is your tangy tomato & goats' cheese linguine

Serve the tangy tomato & goats' cheese linguine with the seeded goats' cheese crumbled on top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
