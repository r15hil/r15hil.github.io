<h4>Step 2</h4>

Add the chopped waxy potatoes to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 30 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the BBQ pulled pork apart using two forks and mix everything through the juices

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed and the pork has started to crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, fill your toasted brioche bun with the apple sauce, smoky stuffing, BBQ pulled pork, apple slaw and your crispy onions – this are your BBQ pulled pork hog roast sandwich

Serve the BBQ pulled pork hog roast sandwich with the roast waxy potatoes and any remaining slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
