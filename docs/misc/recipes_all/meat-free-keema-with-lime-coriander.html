<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s], then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3 min, or until starting to soften, then add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for a further 3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrots into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Tip: Take the meat-free mince off the heat if you need longer to chop to avoid burning!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the rice is cooked and the water has been absorbed

Check and stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice looks a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Stir the chopped coriander and juice of half your lime[s] through the cooked rice – this is your meat-free mince keema

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Chop the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free mince keema in bowls

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
