<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 8 min or until softened and browning slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] finely

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your garam masala, tomato paste, most of the chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) and cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped tomato and cook for a further 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, cardamom pods and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Gently add the chopped basa to the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered for 5 min, or until the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, add your cashew nuts to a pestle & mortar and bash into a fine powder (or blitz in a food processor)

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix to form a paste

Stir the cashew paste into the curry and cook for 2 min further – this is your South Indian-style basa cashew curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the South Indian-style basa cashew curry with the cardamom rice (discard the cardamom pods!)

Garnish with your crispy onions, reserved chopped coriander and reserved chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
