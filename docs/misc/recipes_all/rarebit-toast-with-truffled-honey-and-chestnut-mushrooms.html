<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the ciabatta halves are lightly toasted, spoon the rarebit sauce all over them

Tip: Make sure to spread the sauce to the edges of the ciabatta to stop the corners burning!

Return the tray to the grill and cook for 3-4 min or until the rarebit sauce is lightly browned – these are your rarebit toasts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rarebit toasts with the chopped tomatoes and salad to the side

Top the toasts with the cooked mushrooms and truffled honey

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
