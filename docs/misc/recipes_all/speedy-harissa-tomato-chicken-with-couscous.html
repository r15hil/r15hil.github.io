<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and halved green beans and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken has browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is browning, add the couscous to a heatproof bowl

Add half the chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) and 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water, give everything a good mix up then cover and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve the remaining chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water

Stir in the tomato paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your harissa stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cook, covered, for 5-7 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes are starting to break down

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your harissa & tomato chicken

Fluff the couscous with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa & tomato chicken with the couscous to the side

Dollop with the natural yoghurt and sprinkle over the pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
