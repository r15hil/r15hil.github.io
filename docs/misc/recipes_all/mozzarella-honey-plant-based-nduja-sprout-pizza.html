<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Add your dried yeast to a bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 dough balls!

Toss the dough ball[s] in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Press the dough ball[s] in the centre and gently push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is the size of a baking tray – this is your pizza base[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste, soft cheese and balsamic sun-dried tomato paste to a bowl – this is your pizza base sauce

Add your plant-based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and honey to a bowl and mix until fully combined – this is your honey plant-based 'Nduja</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then finely slice

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the pizza base[s] to a baking tray (or two)

Top with the pizza base sauce, the torn mozzarella, honey plant-based 'Nduja, sliced shallot and the sliced Brussels sprouts

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your mozzarella, honey plant-based 'Nduja & sprout pizza</p><br><br>
