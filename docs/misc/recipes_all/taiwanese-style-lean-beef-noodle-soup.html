<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef mince with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until browned all over

Once browned, add the honey, half the soy sauce and half the five-spice (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until crispy (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything's fragrant, add the beef stock to the pan with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the sliced spring greens stir it all together and cook for 2 min further or until bright green and wilted

Once wilted, add the cooked lean beef mince and give everything a good mix up – this is your Taiwanese-style Beef broth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Divide the drained noodles between 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> bowls and top with your Taiwanese-style beef broth

Tip: Watch out for the star anise and discard

Tear the basil leaves all over and garnish with a lime wedge
