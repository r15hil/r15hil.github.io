<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Soak the skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large bite-sized pieces

Chop your halloumi into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up, then thread the halloumi and veg evenly onto 2 soaked skewers per person

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a baking tray (or two), then  evenly onto  i & veg skewers and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until starting to soften – these are your halloumi, pepper & courgette kebabs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the kebabs are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a small pot over a medium heat with your ground cumin, ground coriander and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish)

Fluff the bulgur wheat with a fork and stir through the chopped parsley  – this is your spiced bulgur</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the halloumi, pepper & courgette kebabs over the spiced bulgur

Drizzle over the sweet & tangy yoghurt and garnish with the remaining parsley leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
