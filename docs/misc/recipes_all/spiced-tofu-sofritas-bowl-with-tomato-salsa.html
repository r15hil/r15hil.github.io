<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Crumble the tofu into small bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the crumbled tofu to a bowl with half your soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!) and your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu

Once hot, add your coated tofu to the pan, and cook for 8-9 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn to the pan with your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, most of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 30 secs or until the spices are fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your tomato paste to the pan with the remaining soy sauce and 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Add the cooked rice to the pan with the sweetcorn and a splash of water (if looking a little dry!)

Stir everything together and cook for 3-4 min or until the rice has warmed through – this is your spiced rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dice your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced rice in a bowl topped with the crispy tofu – this is your spicy tofu sofritas bowl

Top with the diced tomato, chopped coriander, the juice of half the lime wedges and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a grind of pepper and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
