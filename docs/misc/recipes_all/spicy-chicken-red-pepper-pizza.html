<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the pepper strips and chicken breast strips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the pepper has softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your pizza sauce</p><br><br>

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken and peppers are cooked, remove the tray<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred into rough, bite-sized pieces using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the pizzas with the pulled chicken and roasted pepper

Sprinkle over your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your spicy chicken & roasted pepper pizzas

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy chicken & roasted pepper pizzas

Garnish with a handful of salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
