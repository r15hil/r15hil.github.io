<p>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Pat the baby gammon dry with kitchen paper

Tip: use tongs for greater turning control&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned&nbsp;gammon to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) keeping the pan for later


Season with plenty of pepper and place in the oven for 35-40 min or until cooked through and piping hot

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil


Once hot, add the chopped&nbsp;ginger and chopped&nbsp;apricots and cook for 2-3 min


Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]&nbsp;</span>water and the honey&nbsp;then reduce the heat to very low and cook for a further 10-15 min or until you have a jammy, coarse chutney


Tip: mash the chutney with a fork to bind it together more</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, separate the sage leaves from their stems and finely chop


Trim the tails off the Brussels&nbsp;sprouts&nbsp;


Tip: cut&nbsp;any larger sprouts in half so that they cook evenly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the sage and Brussels&nbsp;sprouts&nbsp;to the baking tray


Return the tray to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until everything is cooked through - this is your roast veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the gammon to a clean chopping board, cover it with a tea towel and leave it to rest for 5 min


Once rested, slice the gammon and serve it with the roast veg and&nbsp;chutney


Enjoy!
