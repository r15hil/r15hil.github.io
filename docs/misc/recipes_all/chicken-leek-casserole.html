<p>Add the chopped potatoes, chopped carrot, chicken stock and a generous pinch of salt to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender – this is your chicken & leek casserole</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken & leek casserole in a bowl

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
