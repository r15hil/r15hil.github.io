<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and slice, lengthways into approx. 1cm thick slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the aubergine slices to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then drizzle with olive oil and season with salt

Tip: Try to spread the aubergine slices out as much as you can!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the aubergine is tender

Once cooked, remove from the oven and set aside to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Combine half the chopped shallot (save the rest for later!) with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your walnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the toasted walnuts to a food processor (reserve the pan!) and grind until very fine

Tip: No food processor? Bash the walnuts in a pestle & mortar until very fine!

Combine the ground walnuts and ground paprika in a small bowl with your roasted garlic paste, a pinch of salt and pepper and 2 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your walnut filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the remaining diced shallot, tomato paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) ground coriander and bulgur wheat

Add your vegetable stock mix with 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[750ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until tender – this is your spicy bulgur</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine slices are cool enough to handle, spread the walnut filling on each slice, then roll up the aubergine so the filling is encased – these are your Georgian-style aubergine rolls

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine your mayo and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) in a small bowl with a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Georgian-style aubergine rolls over the spicy bulgur

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot and the reserved chopped coriander

Drizzle over your pomegranate molasses and coriander mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
