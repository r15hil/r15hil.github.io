<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Season your diced beef with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish

Once hot, add the coated diced beef to the dish and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, then remove from the dish and set aside, reserve the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the beef is browning, peel and finely chop 3/4 of your brown onion[s]

Push your cloves into the remaining onion – this is your studded onion

Grate your apple[s] (skin on) and discard the core

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[550ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the dish to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the cracked black pepper, bay leaf[ves], studded onion and half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) with the beef stock and browned beef and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, put the dish in oven for 55 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through – this is your Dutch-style beef hachee stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the beef has been in the oven for 20 min, reboil a kettle, then heat a pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your shredded red cabbage, grated apple and remaining red wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 30 min, stirring occasionally – this is your braised red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a separate pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a grind of black pepper and mash until smooth – this is your mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Dutch-style beef hachee stew over the mash with the braised red cabbage to the side

Discard the bay leaf[ves] and studded onion

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
