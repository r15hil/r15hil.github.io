<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins-on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further

Add your lean beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the lean beef mince is browning, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Once the lean beef mince is browned, add the sliced courgette and cook for 3-4 min further or until the courgette has started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your beef stock mix and your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> [250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and chopped tomatoes and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa lean beef mince ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the ragù is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk

Crumble in half of your Greek cheese and add half of the chopped parsley and mint (you'll use the rest later!)

Mash until smooth then taste for seasoning, adding a pinch more salt if needed – this is your herby Greek cheese mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herby Greek cheese mash on a plate, make a well in the centre and fill with the harissa lean beef mince ragù

Crumble over the remaining Greek cheese and sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
