<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic, pepper strips and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano and ground cumin to the pan

Season with a pinch of sugar and salt, add a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once fragrant, add the meat-free chick'n to the pan with the vegetables and cook for 4-6 min further or until warmed through and starting to brown</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free chick'n is starting to brown, add the tomato stock and cook for a final 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Add the drained linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style meat-free chick'n & pepper gluten free linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cajun-style meat-free chick'n & pepper gluten free linguine and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
