<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and grate your shallot[s]

Add the grated shallot, pork mince (remove the paper if required!), panko breadcrumbs and half your dried oregano (save the rest for later!) to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Crumble in half your Greek cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands are the best way!) – this is your pork mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide the pork mixture<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape into 3 meatballs per person – these are your pork & Greek cheese keftedes

Once the chips have had 10 min, add the pork & Greek cheese keftedes to one side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is in the oven, finely dice half your cucumber

Grate the remaining cucumber

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them roughy and discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze the water out of the grated cucumber and add it to a bowl along with the chopped mint, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and natural yoghurt

Season with pepper and stir it all together – this is your tzatziki</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the halved black olives, Greek cheese cubes and diced tomato to a bowl with the diced cucumber, remaining dried oregano, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Gently mix it all together – this is your Greek salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork & Greek cheese keftedes with the chips and top with the Greek salad

Serve the tzatziki to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
