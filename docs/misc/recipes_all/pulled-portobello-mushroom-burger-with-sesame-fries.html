<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries 

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Remove the stems from your portobello mushrooms

Chop the stems in half

Once hot, add the portobello mushrooms and halved stems to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are cooked, transfer them to a clean board and shred them apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled mushroom to the pan and mix it all up until fully coated in the sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, spread the toasted brioche halves with chilli mayo, then load them up with the cucumber matchsticks, spring onion strips, pulled portobello mushroom and crispy onions – these are your pulled portobello mushroom burgers

Sprinkle the fries with your toasted sesame seeds and serve them with any remaining chilli mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
