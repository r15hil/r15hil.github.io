<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3 min, or until starting to soften, then add your lean beef mince and cook for a further 3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic

Tip: Take the mince off the heat if you need longer to chop to avoid burning!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!), the rice is cooked and the water has been absorbed

Check and stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice looks a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Stir the chopped coriander and juice of half your lime[s] through the cooked rice – this is your lean beef keema

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Chop the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lean beef keema in a bowl

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
