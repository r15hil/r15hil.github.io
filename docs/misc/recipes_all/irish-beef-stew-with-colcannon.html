<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Once hot, add the coated beef strips and cook for 2-3 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once browned, add the onion wedges, chopped garlic, carrots, bay leaves, a pinch of salt and the beef stock

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until thickened – this is your Irish beef stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the stew is cooking, chop the potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and set aside, reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and chop into small pieces

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add a large knob of butter

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion and spring greens and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spring greens are tender, add the cooked potatoes and a large splash of milk to the pot

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your colcannon</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Irish beef stew with the colcannon to the side

Tip: Feeling indulgent? Use the back of a spoon to make a well in the colcannon and add a knob of butter

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
