<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and your ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your paprika fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the fries are cooking, boil half a kettle

Add your ground cumin, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a board

Gently stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Lightly splash your flat white mushrooms with water, then add to the board and turn several times until coated in the spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, dissolve your tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your mayo and white wine vinegar in a small bowl and set aside for later – this is your zingy mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have browned, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for 12-13 min or until the liquid has reduced and the mushrooms have softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your ciabatta[s] in half and add them to a tray, cut-side up

Put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy

Wash your lettuce, then remove 2 outer leaves per person (save these for your burger!) and shred the inner core

Dice your tomato[es]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred apart, using two forks

Return the pulled mushroom to the pan and mix it all up until fully coated in the sauce

Return the pan to a medium heat, top the pulled mushroom with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 1 min further or until melted – this is your Mexican-style pulled mushrooms</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed ciabatta with the lettuce leaves, Mexican-style pulled mushrooms and zingy mayo – these are your Mexican-style pulled mushroom burgers

Serve the Mexican-style pulled mushroom burger with the paprika fries, shredded lettuce and diced tomato to the side

Drizzle any remaining zingy mayo over the lettuce and tomato

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
