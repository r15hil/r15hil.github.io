Add the chopped potato & sweet potato with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then bring to boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, add the drained sweetcorn, soft cheese and half your jerk paste (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your basa fillet[s] and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your chowder

Once cooked, break up the basa with a spoon into bite-sized pieces

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Combine the remaining jerk paste with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper in a heat-proof bowl and cook in the microwave for 30 secs or until the butter has melted – this is your jerk-spiced butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chowder and drizzle over the jerk-spiced butter and sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your one pot jerk-spiced fish chowder

Serve the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
