<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Chop the tomatoes roughly

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the black beans

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat 

Once hot, add the drained black beans with the chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a splash of cold water and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the basa fillets with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your pan-fried smoked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, add the chopped tomatoes, sliced shallot and chopped coriander to a large bowl with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your pico de gallo

Combine the mayo with the chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the juice of the remaining lime in a small bowl – this is your chilli lime mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the beans have softened, add a generous knob of butter or butter alternative and mash them until smooth – these are your quick refried beans

Add the tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 1-2 min, or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your tacos, divide the quick refried beans, pan-fried smoked basa and pico de gallo equally between the warmed tortillas

Dollop over the chilli lime mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
