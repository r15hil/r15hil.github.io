<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with your beef stock mix, diced apricots, half your ground cumin, half your ground coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together and add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Cover with a tea towel and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed – this is your couscous</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the diced onion to a separate bowl with half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!), the remaining ground cumin and remaining ground coriander and mix it all together

Add your beef mince with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your kebab mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Divide the kebab mixture into 3 balls per person, then shape the balls into rough oval shapes – these are your beef kebabs

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef kebabs and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once browned, add the sliced onion to the pan and reduce the heat to medium

Cook, covered, for an initial 6-7 min or until the kebabs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion has softened

Once the kebabs are cooked through, remove the lid and cook for a final 2-3 min or until all the liquid in the pan has gone – these are your spiced beef kebabs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Combine your mayo with the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the couscous with a fork and add the grated carrot, then give everything a good mix up – this is your fruity couscous</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced beef kebabs with the pan-fried onion over the fruity couscous

Drizzle the garlic mayo over the top and season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
