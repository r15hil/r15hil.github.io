<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray(or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your nigella wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your lamb mince and curry powder in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps the patties hold their shape whilst cooking) then shape into 1 patty per person– these are your curried lamb patty[ies]</p><br><br>

<p>Combine the grated carrots and chopped coriander in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chopped salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your bread roll[s] in half

Once the potatoes are almost done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved bread roll[s] to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the bread has warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your natural yoghurt and your mango chutney in a bowl – this is your mango raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread the mango raita over each bread roll base

Top with the curried lamb patties, some chopped salad and a bread roll lid

Serve the spiced wedges, remaining chopped salad and any remaining mango raita to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
