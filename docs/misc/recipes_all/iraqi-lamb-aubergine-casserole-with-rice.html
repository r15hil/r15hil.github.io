<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergines have come out of the oven, remove the foil lid (keep this to one side for later)

Layer up the sliced aubergines, potatoes and tomato sauce (alternating as you go) then top with the lamb meatballs

Cover with the reserved foil and cook for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the foil and cook, uncovered, for a further 5-10 min or until the lamb is cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Let the dish stand for a few mins before serving

Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Serve the Iraqi lamb & aubergine casserole with the steamed rice and a garnish with the chopped herbs

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
