<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam-dry

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the lean pork mince (remove the paper if required) with the panko breadcrumbs, half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later) and a generous pinch of pepper then mix thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined, then shape into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> meatballs

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining chicken stock mix, Dijon mustard, Henderson's Relish and redcurrent jelly in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock

Add the dried cranberries to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate (reserving the pan) and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir until sandy (if your pan is looking dry add a small knob of butter)

Whisk the stock into the flour

Cook for 2-3 min until the stock has thickened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce thickens, chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to the thickened sauce

Return the meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – these are your lean pork Swedish-style meatballs & gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Return the pot of drained potatoes to a low heat and add a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Drain the cranberries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lean pork Swedish-style meatballs & gravy with the mash and peas to the side

Garnish with the cranberries and remaining chopped dill

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
