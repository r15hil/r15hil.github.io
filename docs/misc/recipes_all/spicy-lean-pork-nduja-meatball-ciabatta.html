<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 30 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potato wedges are cooking, combine your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!), ‘Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and panko breadcrumbs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together until the 'Nduja and breadcrumbs are fully incorporated

Divide the mixture equally and shape into 3 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the meatballs to a separate baking tray (use baking paper to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the onion softens, grate your cheddar cheese

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half

Once the onion has softened, add your tomato paste, dried oregano and your balsamic vinegar with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml]</span> boiled water, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Cook for 3-4 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are done, transfer them to the thickened sauce and stir together until they're fully coated

Once the wedges are almost cooked, add the halved ciabatta, cut-side up, to the tray[s] and put in the oven for 1-2 min or until starting to crisp

Tip: This will stop them from going soggy when you add the meatballs!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once starting to crisp, top the bottom of the ciabatta with the meatballs and any remaining sauce

Top the meatballs with the grated cheese and return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your spicy lean pork & 'Nduja meatball ciabatta

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy lean pork & 'Nduja meatball ciabatta with the wedges and salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
