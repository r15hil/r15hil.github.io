<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Top each piece of chicken with a lemon slice and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
