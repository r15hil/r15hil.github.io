<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the baby leaf spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it until it's wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold water until it's cool enough to handle

Squeeze the water out of the cooled spinach (use clean hands for ease) then chop it roughly

Re-boil the kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the sliced garlic, ground fenugreek, garam masala and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the softened onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the chicken breast fillets to the pan and cook for 4-5 min, turning once until they're evenly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, dissolve the  Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, tomato paste and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar in 350ml<span class="text-danger"> [650ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken & tomato stock

Add the chicken & tomato stock and chopped spinach to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low & cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce thickens, crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Melt a knob of butter in a pot with a matching lid over a medium heat

Once melted, add the split cardamom pods and star anise to the pot and cook for 1 min until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice to the pot and cook for 1 min further, then add 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your pilau rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pilau rice is cooking, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add the plain naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Using two forks, carefully shred the cooked chicken, and mix it through the curry – this is your chicken saag masala

Stir the chopped coriander through the pilau rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken saag masala with the warmed naan and pilau rice to the side (don't forget to discard the star anise and cardamom before eating!)

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
