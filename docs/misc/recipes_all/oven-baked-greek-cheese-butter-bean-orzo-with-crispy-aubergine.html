<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into small bite-sized pieces

Combine half your ground paprika (save the rest for later!) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl and set aside to infuse – this is your paprika oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil, your dried oregano and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your cherry tomatoes with your tomato paste and roasted garlic paste

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Drain and rinse your butter beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your orzo and drained butter beans to the dish with your vegetable stock mix, remaining ground paprika, a pinch of sugar and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [700ml] </span>boiled water

Crumble half your Greek cheese (you'll use the rest later!) into the dish, and stir it all together

Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min, stirring halfway, or until the orzo is tender and the liquid has been absorbed – this is your Greek cheese & butter bean orzo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is golden and crisp, remove the tray from the oven and move the aubergine to one side

Add your pine nuts to the other side of the tray, then return it to the oven for a final 2-3 min, or until the pine nuts are toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Greek cheese & butter bean orzo topped with the crispy aubergine and toasted pine nuts

Crumble the remaining Greek cheese all over, then drizzle with the paprika oil

Season to taste with salt and pepper
