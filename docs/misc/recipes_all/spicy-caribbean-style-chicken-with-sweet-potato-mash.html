<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine the zest of your lime[s] with your panko breadcrumbs, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your Caribbean-style crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your chicken thighs to the bowl with the Caribbean-style crumb and toss to coat evenly

Transfer the chicken thighs to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and top evenly with any remaining crumb

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Caribbean-style chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained sweet potato to a low heat with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt, then mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash

Cut the remaining zested lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Caribbean-style chicken with the sweet potato mash and tomato salsa to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion greens and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
