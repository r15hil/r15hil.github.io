<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] lengthways into thirds

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, then crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin</p><br><br>
