<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and soak your skewer[s] in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, your dried oregano and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s] and peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] in half, lengthways

Add the sliced shallot to a large bowl with the halved chicken, your cumin seeds, ground smoked paprika, red wine vinegar, half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up and season with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your marinated chicken

Thread the marinated chicken and sliced shallot onto the soaked skewer[s] in a snake-like fashion – this is your marinated chicken skewer[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Transfer the marinated chicken skewer[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken breast souvlaki skewer[s]

Once cooked through, slide and slice half of the chicken breast souvlaki off each skewer on a clean board</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice half your cucumber into discs

Cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), most of the chopped mint (save the rest for later!), your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt – this is your tzatziki

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty, then carefully slice them in half before serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your sandwich, fill the crusty ciabatta with the sliced chicken breast souvlaki, a dollop of tzatziki, a couple of herby fries and a tomato round – this is your chicken breast souvlaki sandwich

Serve the remaining herby fries to the side with the remaining chicken breast souvlaki skewer, remaining tomato rounds, sliced cucumber and reserved chopped mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
