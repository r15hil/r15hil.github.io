<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Trim your green stalk off the aubergine[s] and chop in half widthways, then cut lengthways into strips

Add your cornflour and aubergine strips to a bowl and mix well so the aubergine is evenly coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated aubergine strips (save any excess cornflour in the bowl for later) and cook for 7-8 min or until starting to brown all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken thigh to the bowl with the remaining cornflour and mix well until evenly coated

Once the aubergine has browned, increase the heat to high, then add the coated diced chicken thigh and cook for a further 10-12 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Combine the chopped garlic in a bowl with the chopped ginger, your soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and rice vinegar

Add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar to the bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your stir-fry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, add the stir-fry sauce to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until sticky – this is your sticky chicken thigh & aubergine stir-fry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Mix the refreshed peas and a pinch of salt through the cooked rice – this is your pea rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky chicken thigh & aubergine stir-fry with the pea rice to the side

Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
