<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 8 min

Slice your sugar snap peas into thirds

Once the pasta has been cooking for 8 min, add the sliced sugar snaps and cook for 2-3 min further or until the farfalle is cooked with a slight bite and the sugar snaps are tender

Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced shallot to the pan with the bacon and reduce the heat to medium, then cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Add the chicken stock and soft cheese and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to thicken

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the cooked farfalle & sugar snaps, reserved crispy bacon slices and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) through the creamy sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy bacon & sugar snap farfalle

Tip: If the sauce is looking a little dry add a splash of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy bacon & sugar snap farfalle with the leafy tomato salad to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with the chopped mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
