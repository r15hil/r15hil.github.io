<h4>Step 5</h4>

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick gravy-like consistency – this is your curried tomato sauce

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Once the sausages are cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and sprinkle over the shredded kale

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 3-4 min or until the kale is cooked and slightly crispy – this is your sausage tray bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage tray bake with the curried tomato sauce drizzled all over

Sprinkle over the remaining curry powder – this is your German-style curried sausage tray bake

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
