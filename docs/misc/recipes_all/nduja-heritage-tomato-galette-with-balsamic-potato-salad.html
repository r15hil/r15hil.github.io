<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the halved potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Add half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) with the grated garlic, a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together so the potatoes are evenly coated

Put the baking tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are tender and lightly charred, then set aside to cool slightly – these are your balsamic roast potatoes</p><br><br>
