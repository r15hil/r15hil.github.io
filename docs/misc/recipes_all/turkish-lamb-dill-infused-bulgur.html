<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with your natural yoghurt, a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper

Tip: Use less garlic if you're not a fan of raw garlic

Mix well and set aside until serving – this is your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water, a pinch of sugar and salt and the remaining chopped garlic – this is your harissa mixture

Add the harissa mixture to the pan and cook for a further 3 min or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Turkish-style harissa lamb & tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Stir half of your ground sumac and half of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) into the drained bulgur

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper – this is your herbed bulgur</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic yoghurt over the herbed bulgur and top with the Turkish-style harissa lamb & tomatoes

Sprinkle with the remaining chopped dill and reserved ground sumac, and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
