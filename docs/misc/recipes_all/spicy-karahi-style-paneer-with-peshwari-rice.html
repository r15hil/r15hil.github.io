<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your coconut flakes and flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer the toasted coconut & almonds to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, sultanas, a pinch of salt, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tsp] <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> </span>sugar and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes and pat dry

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and add a generous drizzle of your vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for 3-5 min or until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely slice a few matchsticks from your ginger and finely chop (or grate) the rest

Slice your green chilli[es] in half lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your sliced onion and halved green chilli[es] to the pan (can't handle the heat? Just add half!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, cut your tomatoes into wedges

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger (save the matchsticks for later!), curry powder and a generous grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Add the tomato stock and chopped tomatoes to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until sauce has thickened – this is your curry

Tip: Don't worry if it's a little thick, karahi is drier than most curries!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add the toasted coconut & almonds and half the chopped coriander to the rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your peshwari rice

Add the cooked paneer and the remaining chopped coriander to the curry and cook for a further 30 secs – this is your spicy karahi-style paneer</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy karahi-style paneer with the peshwari rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the reserved ginger matchsticks

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
