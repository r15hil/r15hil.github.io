<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Add your basmati rice, lemongrass stalk[s] and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the seasoned rump steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak[s] is cooked, transfer them to a plate to rest (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the steak[s] is resting, return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped ginger, chopped pepper and red Thai curry paste and cook for 2-3 or min until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and fish sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock and lime leaf[ves] to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper has started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain your pineapple slices and chop into bite-sized pieces

Tip: Keep the pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Add the chopped pineapple to the pan and cook for 2-3 min until slightly softened – this is your Thai-style red curry

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak[s] on a clean board and serve them over the Thai-style red curry with the lemongrass rice to the side (don't forget to discard the lime leaf[ves] and the lemongrass!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped basil and enjoy!</p><br><br>
