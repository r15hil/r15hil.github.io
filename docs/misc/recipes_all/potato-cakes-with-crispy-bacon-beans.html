Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> sugar and the cider vinegar and bring to the boil

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> flour and mix to combine into a dough

Place the dough onto a floured surface and bring it together into a ball with your hands

Divide the ball into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> pieces and roll each into a golf ball shape

Pat each ball down and sprinkle with a little flour – these are your potato cakes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2-3 tbsp olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the potato cakes and cook for 4 min on both sides or until browned

Transfer to kitchen paper and season with both salt and pepper

Reserve the pan for the next step</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat, add the smoked streaky bacon and cook for 2-3 min each side, or until done to your liking

Stir the remaining chopped chives through the beans and you're ready to serve

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
