<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, cloves, dried cranberries and ground turmeric with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cranberry rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces

Once the shallot has softened, add your chopped paneer to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the paneer is golden, add your curry powder and ground cinnamon to the pan with your ginger & garlic paste, tomato paste and a knob of butter and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and add the spinach with half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and stir it all together until the spinach has wilted – this is your festive paneer curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the festive paneer curry with the cranberry rice to the side

Drizzle the remaining natural yoghurt and your cranberry sauce over the curry

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
