<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then add your white long grain rice, a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam</p><br><br>
