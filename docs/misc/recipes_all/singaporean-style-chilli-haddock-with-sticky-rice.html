<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Roughly chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil on a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped tomato and cook for 7-8 min or until the tomato is starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Add the grated carrot and sliced cucumber to a bowl with half the rice vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the tomato paste with the remaining rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tamari soy sauce, ketchup, cornflour, and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold water and mix it all together – this is your chilli sauce mix

Once the tomato has softened, add the chilli sauce mix to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Once the sauce has thickened, top with the haddock bites and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Singaporean-style chilli haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

While the haddock is cooking, trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Singaporean-style chilli haddock with the sticky rice and quick-pickled veg to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
