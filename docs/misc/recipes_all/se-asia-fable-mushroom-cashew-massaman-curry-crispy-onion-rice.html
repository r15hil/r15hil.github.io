<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] roughly

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are lightly browned, add the chopped onion with your massaman paste and tomato paste

Add the chopped coconut and half the sliced chillies (save some for a garnish!)

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up

Add your waxy potatoes and cashew nuts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 600ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water, the juice of half the lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of pepper

Put the dish in the oven and cook, uncovered, for 45 min or until the potatoes are tender – this is your Fable mushroom & cashew massaman</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the massaman has had 15 min, reboil a kettle

Add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person

Serve the Fable mushroom & cashew massaman and top with the remaining sliced chillies and the lime wedges

Serve the baked rice to the side and top with your crispy onions

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out</p><br><br>
