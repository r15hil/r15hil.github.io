<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is starting to boil, preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves

Cut the halved leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rough bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut 1 piece of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper

Lay the chopped leeks in the middle of the tin foil with a pinch of salt and the toasted sesame oil and add to a baking tray

Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the leeks to form a sealed parcel

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the leeks have softened – these are your slow-roast leeks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the soy sauce, mirin, half of the wasabi paste (save the rest for later!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your wasabi mixture

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Pat the rump steaks dry with kitchen paper, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side

For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the steaks are resting, remove the pan from the heat, add the Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs

Tip: This will help to cool down the pan!

Return the pan to a medium-low heat, add the wasabi mixture and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to thicken

Add the remaining wasabi paste, resting juices and a knob of butter and cook for 1-2 further or until glossy – this is your wasabi sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steaks into thin strips

Serve the sliced steak over the sticky rice and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Drizzle the wasabi sauce all over

Add the slow-roast leeks to a small bowl and garnish with the shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
