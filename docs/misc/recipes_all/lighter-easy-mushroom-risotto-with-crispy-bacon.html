<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once evaporated, add the vegetable stock to the pan a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your mushroom risotto

While the risotto is cooking, grate the lighter cheese

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, stir half the grated lighter cheese (save the rest for garnish!) through the mushroom risotto

Wash the spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add to the pan and stir until the spinach has wilted

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom risotto with the crispy bacon, remaining grated lighter cheese and chopped parsley over the top

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
