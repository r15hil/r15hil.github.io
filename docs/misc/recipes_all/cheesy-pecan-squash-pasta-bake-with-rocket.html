<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Peel the butternut squash and cut in half using a sharp knife, then scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard

Tip: Drizzle the knife with vegetable oil for easier chopping

Chop half of the butternut squash into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> wedges

Cut the remaining butternut squash into bite-sized cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the butternut squash wedges and butternut squash cubes to a tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened

Whilst the squash is cooking, add the tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>boiled water then add 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> milk and give it a good mix up

Chop basil roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the tortiglioni is cooked, drain and keep in the sieve until later, reserve the pot

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a generous knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min

Gradually whisk in the stock, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a thick sauce remains

Add half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) and stir through until melted – this is your white sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the squash is cooked, add the roasted squash wedges (save the cubes for later!) to the white sauce and roughly mash it into the sauce until almost smooth

Add the drained tortiglioni, chopped basil and roasted squash cubes to the sauce and give it a good mix up

Transfer to an oven-proof dish

Top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, snap the pecan nuts in half and sprinkle them over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your cheesy pecan & squash pasta bake

Meanwhile, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your dressing

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the cheesy pecan & squash pasta bake to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve with the rocket to the side and drizzle with the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
