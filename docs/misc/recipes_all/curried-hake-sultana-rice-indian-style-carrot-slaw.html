<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water

Heat a pot with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your ground turmeric and crushed cardamom pods to the pot and cook for 20 secs or until fragrant, then add your basmati rice, sultanas and vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sultana rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discarding the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Roughly chop your cherry tomatoes

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes, 1/3 of the chopped mint and 1/3 of the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your hake fillet[s] to a bowl with your curry powder and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until fully coated – this is your coated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your curried hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, add the grated carrot, sliced spring onion, nigella seeds, remaining chopped mint and remaining chopped coriander to a large bowl

Add the juice of half your lemon wedges, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your Indian-style carrot slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried hake over the sultana rice with the Indian-style carrot slaw to the side

Top the fish with the tomato salsa and garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Tip: Watch out for the cardamom pods!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
