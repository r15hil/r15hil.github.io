<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, skim through these steps then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once the pan is hot, add your diced chicken breast and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the halved green beans and cook for a further 5-6 min or until starting to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your peanut butter, sriracha, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey, rice vinegar and soy sauce to a bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy peanut sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the spicy peanut sauce and drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy peanut chicken noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
