<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins-on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Add your meat-free mince and cook for 4-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the meat-free mince is browning, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Once the mince is browned, add the chopped courgette and cook for 3-4 min further or until the courgette has started to soften</p><br><br>

Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and chopped tomatoes and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your harissa meat-free mince ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk

Crumble in half of your feta and add half of the chopped herbs

Mash until smooth and season to taste – this is your herby feta mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herby feta mash with the harissa meat-free mince ragù to the side

Crumble over the remaining feta and sprinkle over the remaining chopped herbs

Season with a grind of black pepper
