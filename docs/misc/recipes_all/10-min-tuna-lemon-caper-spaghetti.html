<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat


Cook the spaghetti for just 2 min or until cooked with a slight bite (it will keep cooking in the sauce later!)


Once done, drain the spaghetti reserving a large cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set the tuna, lemon &amp; <span class="text-highlight">caper</span> spaghetti in the centre of the table, ready to share
