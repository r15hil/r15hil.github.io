Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Once cooked, transfer the chicken Milanese to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing

Remove the vegetables from the oven and mix them all up until everything's coated in the tomatoey sauce – these are your tomatoey potatoes & green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomatoey potatoes & green beans with the chicken Milanese to the side
