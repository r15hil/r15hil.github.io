<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork and any juices to an oven-proof dish

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of sugar and a splash of boiled water to a bowl

Slice your cucumber as thinly as you can, then add them to the bowl and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

Slice your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground cumin and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your cumin potato wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice your baguette[s] in half

Spread your dijon mustard over one side of your baguette[s] and half your mayo (you'll use the rest later!) over the other side using the back of a spoon</p><br><br>

<p>Top the baguette[s] with half the quick-pickled cucumbers (you'll use the rest later!), sliced cheddar cheese, and your sliced prosciutto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 30 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the BBQ pulled pork apart using two forks and mix everything through the juices, then return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has been absorbed and the pork has started to crisp

Add the BBQ pulled pork to half the baguette[s] and top with the remaining baguette[s] – this is your cubano[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and once hot, add the cubano[s] to the pan and top with an additional pan (cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!)

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 4-5 min per side, checking occasionally or until golden and the cheese has melted – this is your pulled pork cubano[s]

Tip: Slice the pulled pork cubano[s] in half to make it easier to fit in the pan, if required!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the pulled pork cubano[s] in half and serve with the cumin potato wedges, the remaining pickled cucumber and remaining mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
