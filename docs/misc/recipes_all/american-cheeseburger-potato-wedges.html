<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the wedges are cooking, slice your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice the halves into wedges

Add your red wine vinegar, yellow mustard seeds, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar, a splash of boiled water and a pinch of salt to a bowl and stir until dissolved

Add the cucumber wedges to the bowl and give everything a good mix up, then set aside – these are your quick-pickled cucumber wedges

Tip: Give the cucumber the occasional shake while pickling!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted, then set them aside until serving, reserve the pan

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your beef mince and soy sauce to a large bowl with a generous grind of black pepper

Knead thoroughly until fully combined (kneading the patty[ies] for longer will make it more tender!)

Shape into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>burger patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the burger patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your mayo, tomato ketchup and mustard ketchup in a small bowl – this is your special sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, add the grated cheese on top of each burger patty and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheeseburger patty

Drain the quick-pickled cucumber wedges and discard the liquid</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the special sauce onto the toasted brioche base, then top with a cheeseburger patty, a sprinkling of crispy onions and a toasted brioche lid – this is your American-style cheeseburger

Serve the potato wedges and quick-pickled cucumber wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
