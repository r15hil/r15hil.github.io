<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Strip half of your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly (save the reserved rosemary for later!), discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped waxy potatoes to one side of a baking tray (or two!) and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add your chicken thighs to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and sprinkle the chopped rosemary all over

Put the baking tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the potatoes and chicken start to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken and potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the reserved rosemary (stems and all) to the pan and cook for<span class="text-danger"> </span>7-8 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until fragrant

Once the butter has infused, remove and discard the rosemary – this is your infused rosemary butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar in a bowl

Add the infused rosemary butter to the bowl with a grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your rosemary butter sauce

Set aside until serving</p><br><br>

Once the chicken has had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top the potatoes with the halved Tenderstem broccoli and shallot quarters

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10-12 min or until the broccoli is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
