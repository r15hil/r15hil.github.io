<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika over the wedges and put them in the oven for 30 min or until crisp – these are your smoky potato wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the crusty ciabatta in half and assemble the sarnie with the sticky caramelised red onion relish and sliced sausages

Serve the salad, smoky potato wedges and wholegrain mustard mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
