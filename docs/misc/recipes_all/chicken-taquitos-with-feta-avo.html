<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to a plate

Add a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chicken thighs to the spice mix and turn them several times until the chicken is coated in all of the spices

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Dissolve the tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the chicken has browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and reduce the heat to medium

Cook, covered, turning occasionally for a further 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt

Grind to a paste then add the mayo and stir it all together – this is your coriander mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Divide the pulled chicken and sauce evenly between the tortillas

Roll each filled tortilla up and arrange them into an oven-proof dish

Drizzle with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until beginning to crisp – these are your chicken taquitos</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Crumble the Greek feta cheese into rough bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken taquitos topped with the guac, sliced spring onion, crumbled feta and reserved coriander leaves

Drizzle the coriander mayo all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
