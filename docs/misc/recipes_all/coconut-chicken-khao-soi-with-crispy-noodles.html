<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and roughly chop half your brown onion[s]

Slice the remaining onion finely

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the roughly chopped onion and your red Thai curry paste to a food processor with your curry powder, ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> </span>vegetable oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blitz into a smooth paste – this is your khao soi curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with a squeeze of lime and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min and then drain

Add 1/4 of the drained noodles (you'll use the rest later!) to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy noodles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a pot over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Once the chicken has started to brown, add the sliced onion and khao soi curry paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your halved green beans and cook for 6-7 min or until tender

Once done, add the lime zest and some of the chopped coriander and give everything a good mix up – these are your zesty green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the reserved drained noodles to a bowl and top with the coconut chicken khao soi

Top with the quick-pickled shallot and the crispy noodles

Garnish with a lime wedge and the remaining chopped coriander

Serve the zesty green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
