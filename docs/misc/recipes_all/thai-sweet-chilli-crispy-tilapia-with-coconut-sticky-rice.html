<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water, the creamed coconut and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat, add the blanched peas and give everything a good mix up until the peas are warmed through and the coconut cream is fully incorporated

Keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, pat the tilapia fillets dry with kitchen paper

Add the the cornflour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the tilapia fillets to the plate and press them into the seasoned cornflour until fully coated, then tap off the excess</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated tilapia fillets and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy tilapia

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lime to a small bowl with the chilli jam, chopped ginger, sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>water

Stir it all together – this is your sweet chilli sauce

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy tilapia with the sticky coconut rice to the side

Drizzle the tilapia with the sweet chilli sauce and sprinkle over the crispy onions

Garnish with the lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
