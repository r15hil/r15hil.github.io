<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes

Add the potato cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Peel and roughly slice your red onion[s]

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the veg is in the oven, boil half a kettle

Dice your tomato[es]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced tomato with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes have broken down

Add the spicy tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened – this is your bravas sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce thickens, combine your ground coriander, ground smoked paprika, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your smoky spice mix

Add your meat-free chick'n to the smoky spice mix and mix together until they are fully coated, then tap off any excess spices  – this is your coated meat-free chick'n</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your mayo, chopped garlic (not a big fan of raw garlic? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your aioli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky Spanish-style meat-free chick'n with the crispy potatoes and roasted veg to the side

Top the crispy potatoes with the bravas sauce – this is your patatas bravas

Drizzle the aioli all over the patatas bravas

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
