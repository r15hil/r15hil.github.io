<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven and prepare the potatoes


Set the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6. Boil a kettle.


Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) into the&nbsp;waxy&nbsp;potatoes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base &ndash; these are your&nbsp;hasselback&nbsp;potatoes.


Tip: rest the potatoes on to a wooden spoon when cutting, it will prevent you from cutting all the way through the potato!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Roast your hasselback potatoes


Add the&nbsp;hasselback&nbsp;potatoes&nbsp;to a baking tray (use&nbsp;tin foil&nbsp;to avoid mess!), drizzle each with&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;and season with&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and&nbsp;pepper.


Put the tray in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until they're tender and starting to crisp.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cook the peas and pea shoots 


Add the garden peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 minutes or until they're tender.


Once the peas are tender, add most of the&nbsp;pea shoots&nbsp;(save a small handful for garnish!) and cook for 30 seconds or until wilted.


Once wilted, drain and set aside. Reserve the pan for step 5.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Prepare the shallots and stock


Re-boil a kettle.


Peel and finely chop the shallots.


Dissolve the 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> vegetable stock cube in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> boiled water.

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Make the&nbsp;pea velout&eacute;


Return the pot to a medium heat with 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter. Once melted, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes or until softened.


Once softened, add the vegetable stock&nbsp;and&nbsp;clotted cream and cook for 1-2 minutes further or until starting to thicken.


Add the drained peas,&nbsp;pea shoots&nbsp;and&nbsp;creamy stock to a food processor&nbsp;and blend until smooth.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cook the asparagus and toast the almonds 


Once the potatoes are almost cooked, add the asparagus spears to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt.


Return the tray to the oven for 5-8 minutes or until the asparagus is tender with a slight bite.


Add the flaked almonds to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 minutes or until lightly toasted.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cook the salmon fillets


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat.


Season the salmon&nbsp;fillets with a pinch of salt.


Once hot, add the salmon fillets and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until cooked through.


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up! 


Return the pea velout&eacute; to the pot over a medium-low heat and cook for 1-2 minutes or until warmed through.


Serve the pan-fried&nbsp;salmon over the pea velout&eacute; with the hasselback potatoes and asparagus to the side.<br /><br />Tip: spread the velout&eacute; with the back of a spoon for fancy presentation!


Garnish with the toasted almonds and the remaining pea shoots and enjoy!</p><br><br>
