<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the pork mince and cook for 6-7 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, until browned and crisp

Once crisp, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 1 min further until fragrant

Once done, add the pork to a plate and cover with tin foil to keep warm – this is your crispy pork

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the dan dan sauce to your bowls and top with the cooked noodles, crispy pork and softened pak choi
