<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Using a sharp knife, score the duck skin on a diagonal, being careful not to cut through to the meat


Season with a generous pinch of salt, then add the scored duck, skin-side down, to a cold, dry pan over a low-medium heat


Cook for 10-15 min, skin-side down only, or until the skin is golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once golden, transfer the duck, skin-side up, to a baking tray


Put the tray into the oven for 10-12 min for medium


Tip: Cook for 3-5 minutes further if you prefer your duck well done


Once cooked, set the duck aside, cover, and leave to rest for at least 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the duck is cooking, boil a kettle


Combine the rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce with the chopped ginger, garlic and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and stir it all together – this is your hoisin dressing</p><br><br>
