<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the teriyaki sauce mix to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until a sticky sauce has formed – this is your teriyaki sauce

Tip: Stir the sauce as it cooks to stop it from burning!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the basa with the ginger pak choi and edamame rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Spoon the teriyaki sauce all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
