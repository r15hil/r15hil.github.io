<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Pat your pork loin steak[s] with kitchen paper and cut the rind off the steak[s] using a sharp knife, then score the rind on a diagonal, being careful not to cut all the way through

Add the scored rind to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-22 min or until the pork rind is golden and crispy, then set aside until cooled – this is your crackling

Meanwhile, wrap the pork loin steak[s] in your smoked streaky bacon – this is your bacon wrapped pork loin steak[s]

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your butternut squash cubes to one side of a separate baking paper-lined baking tray with your sage (chuck it in, stalks and all!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12 min – this is your sage roasted squash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the bacon wrapped pork loin steak[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until starting to brown, then set aside and reserve the pan

Once the squash has been in the oven for 12 min, transfer the browned steak[s] to the other side of the baking tray, then return to the oven for a final 8-10 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the squash is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add your chicken stock mix, Marmite and onion marmalade to the pan with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a pot and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite

Return the potatoes to a low heat with the Dijon mustard, a knob of butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your mustard mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted bacon wrapped pork loin with the mustard mash, sage roasted squash and Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Garnish with the crackling and pour the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
