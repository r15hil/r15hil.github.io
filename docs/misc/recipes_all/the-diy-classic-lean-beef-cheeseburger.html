<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your red onion[s] and slice 1 round from them per person

Dice the remaining red onion as finely as you can

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the red onion rounds to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray (or pop them on the tray with the chips if you have space!) and drizzle them with a little olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the finely chopped onion, lean beef mince, dried oregano, Henderson's Relish, beef stock mix and a good grind of black pepper to a bowl

Mix together for 1-2 min or until really well combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide your lean beef mince mixture into shape them into 1 patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut 2 thin slices per person from your tomato[es] and set them aside for serving

Chop the remaining tomato roughly

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper then remove 1 outer leaf[ves] per person and set aside until serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces

Slice your cheddar cheese into 3 slices per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips have been cooking for 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef patty[ies] and press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min, reduce the heat to medium-high, flip the patties and cook for a further 2 min or until nicely browned

Mix the torn lettuce and roughly chopped tomato together – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the lean beef patty[ies] with the cheese slices and cook, covered, for a further 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the patty[ies] is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, slice your brioche bun[s] in half and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger top your warmed brioche bun base with a squeeze of tomato ketchup, a reserved lettuce leaf, tomato slices, a cheesy lean beef patty, roasted onion round and the warmed brioche bun lid

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
