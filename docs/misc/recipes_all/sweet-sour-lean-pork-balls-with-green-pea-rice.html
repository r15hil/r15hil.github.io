<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and shallot[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your ginger

Add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a large bowl with half the grated ginger, half the chopped garlic and half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and mix everything together

Divide the pork mixture into 5 per person and shape into small meatballs – these are your pork balls</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork balls to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side, then turn down to medium-high and cook, covered, for 6 min, turning regularly, until your pork is cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork balls are cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove your pineapple from the can (save the juice!) and chop roughly

Add your cornflour to a bowl with the reserved pineapple juice

Add your tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, red chilli relish and remaining soy sauce and mix until smooth – this is your sweet & sour sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pork balls are cooked through and browned, transfer to a plate and set aside, carefully wipe any excess hot oil from the pan using kitchen paper

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the remaining grated ginger, chopped garlic and chopped shallot with a small pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add the sweet & sour sauce and chopped pineapple and cook for 2-3 min further or until reduced to a syrup-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add your blanched peas to the pot and cook for a further 2 min

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green pea rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the green pea rice and top with the sweet & sour lean pork balls

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
