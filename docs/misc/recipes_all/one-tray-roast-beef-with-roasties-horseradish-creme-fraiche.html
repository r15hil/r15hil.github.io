<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 230ºC/ 210ºC (fan)/ gas 8

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a generous splash of cold water, a knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around them to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (or two!), then put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a large heat-proof bowl covered with cling film

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are slightly tender / fork tender</p><br><br>

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 22-25 min or until the beef is cooked through and slightly pink inside

Tip: Prefer no pink meat? Cook your beef for 3-5 min longer!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beef has been cooking for 22-25 min, boil a kettle

Remove the beef from the oven, transfer it to a clean chopping board and leave to rest for 4-5 min – this is your mustard roast beef

Add your blanched peas to the parcel with the carrot batons

Return the tray to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the potatoes are roasted and golden and the peas are warmed through</p><br><br>

<p>Once everything is nearly ready, combine your gravy base with 125ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof jug, whisk thoroughly

Put the jug in the microwave and cook for 30-40 secs or until thickened and give everything a good mix up – this is your gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested beef finely

Serve the sliced beef with the roast potatoes, buttered veg and horseradish crème fraîche to the side

Drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
