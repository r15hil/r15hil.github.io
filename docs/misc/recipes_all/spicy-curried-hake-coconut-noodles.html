<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the rice noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into wedges

Trim, then chop the green beans in half

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, tamari soy sauce and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat the reserved pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add the ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop the hake fillets into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake and halved green beans to the pan

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until the fish is cooked through and the green beans are tender

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked through, add the drained rice noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy curried hake coconut noodles

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy curried hake coconut noodles in bowls and garnish with the toasted coconut flakes

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
