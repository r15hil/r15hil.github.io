<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt, then cook for 5-6 min or until the onion is starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your chives finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add your basmati rice to the pan with the chopped garlic, ground coriander and a generous pinch of pepper

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, stirring continuously

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until the rice is tender and the stock has absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your natural yoghurt, the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl

Stir it all together – this is your lemon yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is tender and the stock has absorbed, add your salmon flakes and spinach to the pan with your blanched peas, half the chopped herbs and lemon zest

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a gentle mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cook, covered, for a final 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the peas are warmed through – this is your salmon, pea & spinach pilaf

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking dry!

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salmon, pea & spinach pilaf topped with the remaining chopped herbs

Drizzle over the lemon yoghurt and season with a good grind of pepper

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
