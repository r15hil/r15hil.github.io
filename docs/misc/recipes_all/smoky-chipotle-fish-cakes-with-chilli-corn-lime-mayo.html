<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and run the potatoes under cold water until cool, then return to the pot and crush</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, pat your smoked basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and place them on a tin foil-lined baking tray and drizzle with olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the smoked basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Drain your sweetcorn

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Add your panko breadcrumbs and ground smoked paprika to a large plate – these are your smoky breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Flake the cooked basa into the crushed potatoes, add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper then mix

Divide the mixture into 2 per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape into fishcakes, then press into the smoky breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat – these are your smoky chipotle fishcakes

Add the smoky chipotle fishcakes to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!), drizzle with olive oil and put in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Add your mayo, lime zest, a squeeze of lime juice and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water to a bowl and mix well – this is your zingy lime mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char

Once staring to char, add the chopped tomato and diced onion and cook for 3-4 min further or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add a knob of butter to the pan along with most of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!), your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli corn</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chipotle fishcakes over the chilli corn with the zingy lime mayo in a small bowl to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
