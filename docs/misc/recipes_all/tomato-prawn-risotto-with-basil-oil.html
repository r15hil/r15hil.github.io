<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your tomato risotto

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grind most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is almost done, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Drain your king prawns

Once hot, add the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until coloured and cooked through, then season lightly with pepper

Once the risotto is cooked, add your red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 2 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the cooked prawns and grated cheese to the tomato risotto and gently stir it all together – this is your tomato & king prawn risotto

Serve the tomato & king prawn risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Drizzle the basil oil all over
