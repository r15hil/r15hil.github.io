<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your beef mince, grated onion, panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the meatball mixture into 6 per person and shape them into meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2 min, turning occasionally, or until they’re browned all over

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

Once the meatballs have browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 70ml<span class="text-purple"> [95ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> boiled water

Once the meatballs are browned, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock, half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar

Return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-11 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella and tear it into rough pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the meatballs and sauce to an oven-proof dish (or individual dishes)

Top with the torn mozzarella and put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until melted and bubbling – these are your cheesy meatballs

Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabattas in half, then add to a baking tray and put in the oven for 1-2 min or until slightly toasted

Once slightly toasted, spread each slice with butter and top with the remaining garlic, then return to the oven for a further 3-4 min

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and tear into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy meatballs with the garlic ciabatta and torn lettuce to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
