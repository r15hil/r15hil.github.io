<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the air fryer to 200°C

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Transfer the halved tomatoes to a heatproof bowl with a spray of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Transfer the bowl to the air fryer basket and cook for 5 min or until the tomatoes are charred and starting to break down, then set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the tomatoes are cooking, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and slice, lengthways into 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>wedges per person

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate

Combine your cumin seeds and nigella seeds with your panko breadcrumbs on a separate plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your spiced breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Coat the aubergine wedges in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the beaten egg and finally press into the spiced breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your coated aubergine wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the coated aubergine wedges to the air fryer basket with a generous spray of vegetable oil

Cook for 10-12 min, turning once halfway, or until golden and cooked through – this is your Indian-style crispy aubergine

Tip: Air fryers work best when the food is spaced out in a single layer. You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the aubergine is cooking, combine half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the roasted tomatoes

Add your cider vinegar, mango chutney, black mustard seeds, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and leave to pickle – this is your roasted tomato quick-pickle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

When the aubergine is nearly ready, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warmed tortillas topped with the spinach, Indian-style crispy aubergine and roasted tomato pickle

Drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
