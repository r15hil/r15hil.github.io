<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small cubes, then add the potato cubes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half of the dried sage (you’ll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Add a large knob of butter to a bowl with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water

Once the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot, panko breadcrumbs and the remaining dried sage

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and set aside to absorb – this is your stuffing mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim and halve the Brussels sprouts

Roll the stuffing mix into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16] </span>stuffing balls

Once the potatoes have had 10 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and add the stuffing balls and halved sprouts with a few knobs of butter

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven and cook for 8 min further or until everything is starting to colour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel the parsnips, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of parsnip ribbons

Once everything's had 8 min, add the parsnip ribbons to the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drizzle a little vegetable oil over the ribbons and return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a final 5-7 min or until everything is golden – these are your Christmas trimmings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, stack the tortillas and cut into triangles

Once the Christmas trimmings are golden, transfer them to a plate and set aside

Add the tortilla triangles to the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned – these are your nachos</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a final 3 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your Christmas nachos with all the trimmings</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
