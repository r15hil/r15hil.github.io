<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice to a pot with a matching lid with the coconut stock

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Add your fish sauce, kaffir lime leaves and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and stir it all together – this is your fish stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)

Slice your red chilli[es] finely into strips

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash, then chop the roots from your pak choi and separate the leaves, discarding the roots, and pat dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted

Transfer the wilted pak choi to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper, then return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sea bass fillet[s], skin side down with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, transfer your sea bass to the same plate as the wilted pak choi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic to the pan with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the chopped coriander stalks and cook over a high heat for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the fish stock and cook for a further 1-2 min

Add the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan – this is your aromatic broth

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconut rice in a bowl with the wilted pak choi to the side and ladle over the aromatic broth

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the coconut rice into a small bowl and turn out

Serve the sea bass over the rice and garnish with the coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
