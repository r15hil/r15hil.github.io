<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into rough bite-sized pieces and cook for 4-5 min or until browned

Once browned, transfer the browned chicken to a plate, reserve the pan and juices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-8 min or until soft and starting to caramelise

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Heat a pot with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the crushed cardamom and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to the softened onion and cook for a further 5-8 min or until starting to brown, stirring occasionally

While the veg is browning, dissolve the chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your tomatoes into wedges

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and curry powder to the pan and stir until the veg is coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 min, then return the browned chicken to the pan with the tomato wedges and chicken stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken has cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your free range chicken jalfrezi

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter – this is your buttery cardamom rice

Serve the free range chicken jalfrezi with the buttery cardamom rice to the side (discard the cardamom pods!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
