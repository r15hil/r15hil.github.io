<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar, reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 6-7 min or until softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your soft cheese in a bowl with your Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>boiled water, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Line half a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife (the border will puff up and form a nice crust)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Spread the soft cheese mix over the pastry within the border and top with the caramelised onion (reserve the pan), chopped spinach and pumpkin seeds

Add the chopped potatoes to the other side of the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your dried oregano and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up, and the potatoes are golden – this is your spinach tart and crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add your cherry tomatoes with your balsamic vinegar and cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have started to blister – these are your balsamic tomatoes

Combine your red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your salmon fillet[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (skin-side down) and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, put the tray in the oven and cook for 14-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Remove the base of your lettuce, wash under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once the tart is done, add the lettuce to the dressing and give it a good mix up

Flake the cooked salmon with a fork, discard the skin

Top the spinach tart with the cooked salmon flakes

Serve the salmon & spinach tart with the crispy potatoes, dressed lettuce and balsamic tomatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
