<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Boil a kettle

Once hot, add your lamb mince to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Dissolve your tomato paste, red wine paste and beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add your dried oregano and most of your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the lamb has begun to brown, add the sliced shallot to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has softened, add your roasted garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the spicy stock to the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook for a final 3 min or until thickened and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy lamb & chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked spaghetti to the spicy lamb & chilli sauce with a splash of starchy pasta water

Mix it all together and cook for a final 1 min or until the sauce is coating the spaghetti – this is your spicy Sardinian-style lamb & chilli spaghetti

Tip: Add another splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy Sardinian-style lamb & chilli spaghetti topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Sprinkle the remaining chilli flakes over the spaghetti (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
