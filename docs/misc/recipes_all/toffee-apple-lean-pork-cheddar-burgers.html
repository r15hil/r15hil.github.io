<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) and sweet potato[es] (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your apple[s] (skin on) and discard the core[s]

Peel and chop your red onion[s] in half

Finely dice half of the onion

Slice the remaining onion finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the diced onion and half of the grated apple (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!), panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a very good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your lean pork mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Divide the lean pork mix shape into 1 lean pork patty per person

Cut your cheddar cheese into 4 pieces per person

Top the middle of the lean pork patty[ies] with 4 pieces of cheddar and seal them in with the pork (make sure there are no gaps) – this is your cheese-stuffed lean pork patty[ies]

Add the cheese-stuffed lean pork patty[ies] to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-7 min or until beginning to caramelise

Once caramelised, add your balsamic vinegar, remaining grated apple and your onion marmalade then cook for 2-3 min further until sticky – this is your toffee apple & caramelised onion jam</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the chips have 5 min left, top them with the shredded kale

Add a pinch of salt and a drizzle vegetable oil and return the tray to the oven for 5 min, or until it's crispy – this is your crispy kale</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut your ciabatta[s] in half

Once the patty[ies] has 3-4 min left, add the halved ciabatta to the tray[s] and return to the oven until warmed and toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add a dollop of tomato ketchup to the toasted ciabatta base

Top with a cheese-stuffed lean pork patty, a spoonful of the toffee apple & caramelised onion jam and the toasted ciabatta lid – this is your toffee apple, lean pork & cheddar burger

Serve the crispy kale and chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
