<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once absorbed, continue to add the remaining stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim and slice your spring onions finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Wash your salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the sliced spring onion, chopped mint, baked feta and half of the salad – this is your feta & mint shoot risotto

Serve the feta & mint shoot risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining salad

Season with a crack of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
