<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the leek is softening, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 550ml <span class="text-purple">[720ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[940ml]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk – this is your creamy vegetable stock

Drain your sweetcorn

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add the chopped smoked basa, soft cheese and drained sweetcorn to the pan and gently stir it all together

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until the smoked basa is cooked through and the potatoes are fork-tender – this is your one-pot smoked basa, leek & sweetcorn chowder

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot smoked basa, leek & sweetcorn chowder and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
