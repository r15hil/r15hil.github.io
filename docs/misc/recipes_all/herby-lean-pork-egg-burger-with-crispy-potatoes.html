<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes

Add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are brown and crispy – these are your crispy paprika potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, combine your lean pork mince, panko breadcrumbs, Henderson's Relish, soy sauce, dried oregano and dried sage in a bowl with a pinch of salt and black pepper

Divide the mixture into 1 per person, shape into patties, press them down with your hands and refrigerate until later – this is your herby lean pork patty[ies]

Tip: Chilling the patty helps it hold its shape whilst cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and slice into quarters

Add the lettuce quarters to a bowl with your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – these are your dressed lettuce quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the herby lean pork patty[ies] and cook for 5 min on one side then flip the patty and reduce heat to medium-high, cook for a further 5 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Keep pressing the patty down with a spatula to keep flat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove the tray with the potatoes from the oven and push the potatoes to one side of the tray

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add, cut side down, to the other side of the tray and put back in the oven for 4-5 min to warm through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the herby lean pork patty[ies] are cooked, transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm – this is your herby lean pork burger

Keep the pan (and any remaining oil from the burger!) for the next step</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add a drizzle of vegetable oil

Crack your egg[s] into the pan and season with a pinch of salt

Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, fill the warmed brioche bun with some mustard ketchup, a herby lean pork burger, a fried egg and a sprinkling of crispy onions – this is your herby lean pork & egg burger

Serve the herby lean pork & egg burger with the crispy paprika potatoes and the dressed lettuce quarters to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
