<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, ground cumin and ground smoked paprika with the chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the shallot has slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar

Mix it all together – this is your spicy stock

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the spicy stock and drained black beans to the pan and cook for a further 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your bean chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chilli is cooking, zest half the lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Combine your mayo with the juice of the lime lime[s], the lime zest, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your zesty slaw dressing

Grate your cheddar cheese finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are cooked, push them into 1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with the bean chilli then the grated cheese and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Once done, set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly – these are your loaded bean chilli cheese fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the cheese is melting, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Combine the grated carrot, shredded lettuce and zesty slaw dressing in a bowl then give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty slaw

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the loaded bean chilli cheese fries with the zesty slaw to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
