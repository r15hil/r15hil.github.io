<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the halved tomatoes to the pan along with your roasted garlic paste and ground smoked paprika and cook for 1-2 min until the tomatoes have started to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the vegetable stock, chopped tomatoes and drained black beans to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until thickened and gently bubbling – these are your smoky beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Make 1 well per person in the smoky beans and crack your egg[s] into the well

Cover with a lid and cook for 4-6 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your smoky beans & egg

Add your wholemeal pitta to the toaster for 1-2 min until warmed through, then slice into triangles – these are your pitta chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways

Roughly chop your chives</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky beans & egg in a bowl with the sliced avocado and pitta chips to the side – this is your smoky Mexican-style breakfast bowl

Sprinkle over the chopped chives and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
