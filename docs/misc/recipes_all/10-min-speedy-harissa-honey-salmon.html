<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then boil half a kettle

Once the pan is hot, add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with your ground turmeric and your vegetable stock mix

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your cucumber roughly

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your lemon[s] in half

Add the chopped cucumber and tomato to a bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and the juice of half the lemon[s]

Give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber & tomato salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the salmon is cooked, drizzle your honey over and add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce is sticky – this is your harissa & honey salmon

Transfer the harissa & honey salmon to a clean plate

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water to the pan and stir it all together until the sauce has loosened a little</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, stir the chopped parsley through the couscous

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa & honey salmon over the couscous with the cucumber & tomato salad to the side

Spoon any remaining harissa & honey sauce from the pan over the salmon and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
