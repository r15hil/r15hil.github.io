<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once browned, add your ground cumin with a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer to a clean board (reserve the pan) and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once softened, add your chipotle paste and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your chicken stock mix and tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and cook for 5 min or until a thick sauce remains – this is your chipotle sauce

While the sauce is thickening, drain and rinse your black beans and sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer 1/3 of the chipotle sauce to a medium-sized pot – this is your enchilada topping

Add the drained black beans & sweetcorn and pulled chicken to the pan with the remaining chipotle sauce and give it a good mix up – this is your enchilada filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reheat the enchilada topping over a high heat for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream consistency

Meanwhile, tear your cheese flavour slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Divide the enchilada filling between your tortillas

Roll up each tortilla tightly and place them in an oven-proof dish

Top with the enchilada topping and torn cheese flavour slices

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tortillas are crispy and the cheeze has melted – these are your lighter cheezy chipotle chicken enchiladas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lighter cheezy chipotle chicken enchiladas

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
