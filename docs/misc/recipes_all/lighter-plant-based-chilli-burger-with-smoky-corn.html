<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil with half the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to the baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender – this is your smoky corn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>boiled water and stir until dissolved

Once dissolved, add the red wine vinegar and sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the patties are almost cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and add the ciabatta halves, cut side up

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the ciabatta halves are hot and crusty

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>slices</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each warmed ciabatta with a lettuce leaf, 2 tomato slices and a vegan patty and top with the black bean chilli and the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve the smoky corn and lettuce wedges to the side and drizzle some of the pickling liquid over the lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
