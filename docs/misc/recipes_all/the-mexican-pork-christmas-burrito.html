<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the ground allspice and white long grain rice and cook for 30 secs, then add 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining sliced red onion to a medium bowl with a pinch of salt and the white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion is starting to caramelise, add the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), smoked paprika and pork mince to the pan with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 10-12 min or until crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chipotle pork

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the pork is cooking, stack 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> tortillas and slice in half, then into strips

Add the tortilla strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out as much as you can

Put the tray in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your tortilla chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the Brussels sprouts to a food processor and blitz until roughly chopped (alternatively, chop them up as finely as you can!)

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>and coriander roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped sprouts, tomato and coriander to the quick-pickled onion with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your sprout salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tortilla chips are crisp, transfer them to a plate and set aside until serving

Add the remaining tortillas to the baking tray and return it to the oven for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Add each warmed tortilla to a sheet of tin foil and evenly layer with some sour cream, the cooked rice,<span class="text-danger"> </span>the<span class="text-danger"> </span>chipotle pork and some sprout salsa (save some for the side!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Wrap in the tin foil to hold it all together – this is your Mexican pork Christmas burrito

Dollop the remaining sour cream and sprout salsa over the tortilla chips

Garnish with a lime wedge and enjoy!</p><br><br>
