<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut narrow slices (about 1cm in width) into the butternut squash halves, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base

Transfer the butternut squash halves to a baking tray and drizzle generously with olive oil and a big pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 40-45 min or until the butternut squash is soft – this is your hasselback butternut squash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the walnuts and toast for 3-4 min, or until they've darkened in colour slightly

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the basil coarsely (including the stalks)

Peel and roughly chop the garlic

Crumble the cheddar into small pieces

Transfer the toasted walnuts to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop the walnuts with a knife, then add to a pestle & mortar!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped basil, chopped garlic and crumbled cheddar to the food processor with the toasted walnuts (or a pestle & mortar)

Add the red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper, and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz together to form a coarse purée – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the cherry tomatoes in half

Fluff the cooked bulgur then stir through the halved cherry tomatoes and half of the walnut & cheddar pesto (reserve the rest for garnish!) – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto bulgur

Wash the rocket, then pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hasselback butternut squash over the walnut & cheddar pesto bulgur and rocket

Dot the remaining walnut & cheddar pesto all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
