<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of parsnip ribbons, chop any remaining parsnip roughly and set aside for later

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely then add to a small bowl (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the parsnip ribbons, cider vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>boiled water and set aside – this is your chilli parsnip quick-pickle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then top, tail, peel and grate 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the grated parsnip to a medium bowl with the gram flour, half the turmeric (save the rest for later!), a very generous pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Massage the mixture for 20 secs, squeezing the parsnip together gently to keep some texture

Tip: Squeezing the mix will release the natural moisture in the parsnip!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Scoop out 6 <span class="text-danger">[12] </span>small<span class="text-danger"> </span>handfuls of the mixture, shape into rough bhaji shapes and add to a baking paper-lined baking tray – these are your parsnip pakoras

Drizzle the parsnip pakoras with a little vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 22-25 min or until the pakoras are golden, charred and crispy on the outside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!) and dissolve the vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 550ml <span class="text-danger">[950ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under cold water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel the remaining parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, curry powder and the remaining ground turmeric and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils and all the chopped parsnip to the pot and cook for 1-2 min or until everything is coated in the spices

Once coated, add the coconut stock, bring to the boil over a high heat, and cook for 15-16 min or until the lentils are tender and starting to break down – this is your spiced parsnip dal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the dal is cooking, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Once everything is nearly ready, add the rotis to a separate baking tray and sprinkle them with a little cold water

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Meanwhile, drain the chilli parsnip quick-pickle and discard the pickling liquid</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Loosen the green tomato chutney with a little cold water

Serve the parsnip dal in bowls topped with the chilli parsnip quick-pickle and chopped coriander

Place the warmed rotis and parsnip pakoras to the side with green tomato chutney for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
