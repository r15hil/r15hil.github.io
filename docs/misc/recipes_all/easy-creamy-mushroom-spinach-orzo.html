<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Mix the chopped garlic with a generous knob of butter in a small bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic butter

Tip: If your butter is not soft then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!

Add your portobello mushroom[s] to a baking tray and top with the garlic butter, then put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the mushroom[s] is tender and juicy – this is your garlic roasted portobello mushroom</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until browned

Once the mushrooms have browned, add the diced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> milk – this is your stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your orzo to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the stock and soft cheese and cook, covered, stirring frequently, for 10-12 min, or until the orzo is cooked with a slight bite

Tip: Stirring the orzo will release the starch from the pasta, making it creamier!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the orzo is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the orzo is cooked, add the spinach and the grated cheese and cook for a further 1-2 min, stirring until wilted

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy mushroom & spinach orzo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy mushroom & spinach orzo in a bowl and top with a garlic roasted portobello mushroom

Garnish with the chopped basil and a good grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
