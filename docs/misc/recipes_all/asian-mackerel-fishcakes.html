<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim and slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Peel the skin off the smoked&nbsp;mackerel&nbsp;and discard


Flake the flesh into bite-sized pieces


Combine the chilli jam and a splash of &nbsp;cold water in a small bowl - this is your sweet chilli dressing&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are drained, transfer them to a large bowl &nbsp;


Break the noodle nest<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half&nbsp;over&nbsp;the empty pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite, then drain and run under cold water until they're cooled&nbsp;

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, mash the drained&nbsp;potatoes with a large knob of butter


Add the sliced&nbsp;spring onion, flaked mackerel and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour&nbsp;and season generously with both&nbsp;salt and pepper, then mix to combine to a dough


Divide the dough into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span>&nbsp;pieces and roll each into a golf ball


Pat each ball down - these are your mackerel fishcakes&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick)&nbsp;with a very large drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil (you need enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat&nbsp;


Once&nbsp;hot, add the mackerel&nbsp;fishcakes and cook for 4 min on both sides or until they're browned


Once done, transfer the fishcakes to kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil and sprinkle them with salt&nbsp;

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mackerel fishcakes&nbsp;with the&nbsp;noodle salad and sprinkle with the toasted&nbsp;sesame seeds


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
