<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the green beans are cooking, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and the chopped coconut cream in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir through the mild curry paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of sugar – this is your korma sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed brown basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

Once done, add the heated brown basmati rice to the cooked beans with a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the korma sauce and cook for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the haddock bites and cook for 4-5 min until the fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your fish korma

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fish korma over the cooked brown rice and green beans

Garnish with the chopped spring onion and nigella seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
