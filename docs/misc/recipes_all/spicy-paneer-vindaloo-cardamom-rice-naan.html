<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish is a fusion of East and West, with the influence of Portugal shining through. Vinegar was brought over to India in the 16th century by the Portuguese, and thus the characteristic hot, sour flavours of the vindaloo were born. Basil adds a subtle anise flavour. If you like spice, you'll vinda-love it!</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the paneer into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped paneer to a bowl with the cider vinegar, ground cumin, ground paprika and half the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Tip: Only add half the cayenne pepper now, then taste later and add the rest if it needs more kick!

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coated paneer</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onions have softened, add a small knob of butter with the halved tomatoes and sliced garlic and cook for 6-8 min further or until the tomatoes are starting to break down

Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice, crushed cardamom pods and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the coated paneer (scrape out all of the spices from the bowl too!), half the basil leaves (save the rest for garnish!) and a grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until the spices are fragrant

Add the tamarind stock and cook for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your spicy paneer vindaloo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the mini garlic & coriander naans to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot

Tip: Once the vindaloo is done, taste the sauce and stir through the remaining cayenne if it needs more kick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy paneer vindaloo with the cardamom rice and warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the chopped basil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
