<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil and drizzle with olive oil

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to the other side of the baking tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your ground smoked paprika and dried oregano in a bowl with a pinch of salt, pepper, sugar and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up, then add your chicken thighs and turn them until they're fully coated in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for an initial 10 min or until the skin has started to crisp and char slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine your mayo, horseradish, cider vinegar and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your white BBQ sauce

Chop your chives finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken skin is crispy, reduce the heat to medium-high and turn the chicken thighs and cook for 8 min on the other side until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky Alabama-style chicken

While the chicken is cooking, wash and chop your lettuce into 2 wedges per person, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Cut the smoky Alabama-style chicken in half on a clean chopping board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky Alabama-style chicken with the potato wedges, corn and lettuce wedges to the side

Drizzle the white BBQ sauce over the chicken and lettuce wedges and garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
