<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Drain your sweetcorn

Once the pan is hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char

Tip: Keep an eye on the pan to make sure you don't burn the corn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Meanwhile, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and stir it all together

Add your salmon fillet[s] and press them firmly into the spice mix until evenly coated all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add the spice-coated salmon fillets, skin-side down

Cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your blackened salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the juice of half your lime[s] and 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> [4 tsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl – this is your lime dressing

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Remove the base of your lettuce then wash under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sweetcorn has charred, add the remaining lime juice to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your charred chilli corn</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your blackened salmon with the cooked brown rice, charred chilli corn and lettuce leaves to the side

Crumble over your feta, drizzle over the lime dressing and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
