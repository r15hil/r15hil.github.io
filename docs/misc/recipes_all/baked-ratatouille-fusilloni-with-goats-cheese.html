<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large, bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and cut your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then chop into large chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper, courgette chunks and onion wedges to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] on the bottom shelf of the oven and cook for 30 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Add the crushed garlic to the dish with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix, then add your chopped tomatoes, Henderson's Relish, dried basil and 450ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [850ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir through your tortiglioni, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked through

Tip: Nestle as much of the pasta as you can into the sauce to help it cook evenly!

Give the tortiglioni a stir and the roasted veg on the tray a good mix up after 15 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, stir the roasted veg through the pasta and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your baked ratatouille tortiglioni

Crumble your goats' cheese all over

Season with a grind of black pepper

Dig in!</p><br><br>
