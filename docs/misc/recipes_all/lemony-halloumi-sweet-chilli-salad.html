<p><strong>Description:</strong> We love halloumi - it's a big, mighty cheesy steak, especially when you cook it this way. You'll boil it to remove some of its saltiness and then roll it out into a steak and pan fry until golden. Served over a pea shoot, carrot, courgette and bulgur salad with a chilli-lemon dressing for kick. </p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

Add 500ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]&nbsp;</span>boiled water to&nbsp;a pot and return to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, carefully add the halloumi slices and boil for 5-8 min or until they've softened&nbsp;</p><br><br>
