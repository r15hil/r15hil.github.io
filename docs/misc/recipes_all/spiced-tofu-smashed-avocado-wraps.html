<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your drained black beans to the pot with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [75ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the beans have softened

Once the beans have softened, gently crush them with a masher a few times and set aside – these are your refried beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the beans are cooking, cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways around the stone[s], remove the stone[s] using a spoon then scoop out the avocado flesh

Add the avocado flesh to a small bowl with half of your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and the remaining diced shallot

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash with a fork until smooth – this is your smashed avocado</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut it into strips

Add the tofu strips to a bowl with your soy sauce

Add the remaining smoked paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Coat the tofu strips in the flour mix – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 6 min, turning often or until crispy all over, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper – this is your crispy smoky tofu

Meanwhile, combine the remaining white wine vinegar with your mayo – this is your tangy mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top half of each warmed tortilla with some of the refried beans, smashed avocado, crispy tofu, shredded lettuce and a drizzle of tangy mayo

Fold the sides of each tortilla in and roll until you have a tight wrap

Slice them in half – these are your spiced tofu & smashed avocado wraps

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
