<p><strong>Description:</strong> These tortilla-based pizzas are a quick and easy twist on the Neapolitan classic. By using tortillas for the base, you get that crunchy snap that you can only usually get from a wood-fired oven. The rocket and Italian hard cheese salad sits on top, adding a freshness and a peppery flavour.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, tear the&nbsp;mozzarella&nbsp;into large pieces


Pat the torn mozzarella&nbsp;with kitchen paper, pressing down very firmly so that the mozzarella is nice and dry (this stops your pizzas from being soggy)


Cut the baby&nbsp;plum tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Top with the torn&nbsp;mozzarella, basil leaves and halved baby plum tomatoes


Season with a pinch of salt and return to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until the mozzarella has fully melted and the tortillas are crispy &ndash; these&nbsp;are your tortizzas</p><br><br>
