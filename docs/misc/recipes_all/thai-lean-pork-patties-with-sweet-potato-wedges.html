<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sweet potato wedges are cooking, trim and finely slice your spring onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and garlic

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and roughly chop the leaves (discard the stalks)

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your lean pork mince (remove the paper, if required!) to a bowl with the chopped ginger and garlic, panko breadcrumbs, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced spring onion and chopped herbs

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the Thai-style lean pork patties and cook for 5 min on one side then flip the patties and reduce heat to medium-high, cook for a further 5 min until the patties are browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Press the patties down with a spatula to keep them flat throughout cooking</p><br><br>

Add the sliced radishes and cucumber ribbons to a bowl with the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime wedge[s], a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil

Gently mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled radish salad</p><br><br>
