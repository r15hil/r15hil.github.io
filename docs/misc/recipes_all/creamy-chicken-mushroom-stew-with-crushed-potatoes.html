<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Once the dish is hot, add your chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is in the oven, add your potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) and prick them a few times with a sharp knife

Add a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 40-45 min or until cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 40-45 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your crème fraîche with a generous pinch of pepper – this is your creamy chicken & mushroom stew

Remove the potatoes from the oven and crush them firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a plate

Add a small knob of butter and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – these are your crushed potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken & mushroom stew with the crushed potatoes to the side

Dig in!</p><br><br>
