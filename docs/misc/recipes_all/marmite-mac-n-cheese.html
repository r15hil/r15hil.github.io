<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Melt 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter in a pan over a medium heat

Once melted, add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Gradually whisk 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add the double cream, Dijon mustard and half the Marmite (save the rest for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, stir it all together and remove the pan from the heat – this is your Marmite béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the macaroni is cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

In a bowl combine the grated Italian hard cheese with the panko breadcrumbs – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

In a separate bowl combine the remaining Marmite with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>boiled water – this is your Marmite drizzle

Tip: Whisk it together until fully combined!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Add the drained macaroni with the grated cheddar and give everything a good mix up until the cheese has melted

Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

Drizzle generously with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your Marmite mac 'n' cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the Marmite mac 'n' cheese has been in the oven for 10 min, reboil a kettle

Add the Tenderstem broccoli and green beans to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain, return to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the Marmite mac 'n' cheese from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min

Serve the Marmite mac 'n' cheese with the cooked greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
