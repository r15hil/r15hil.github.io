<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat, then once hot, add your peanuts and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, add in your mango chutney, give everything a good mix and cook for 1 min or until the peanuts are evenly coated, then transfer to a plate (save the pan!) and place in the fridge – these are your mango-glazed peanuts</p><br><br>
