<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7, and boil half a kettle

Tip: Keep your pastry chilled in the fridge until step 4 to make carving easier!

Peel the butternut squash and cut in half, scoop out the seeds and discard, then cut the squash into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the butternut squash pieces to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min or until the squash pieces are fork tender

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the squash is cooking, cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Unwrap the puff pastry and cut it into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>squares

Carefully carve a pumpkin shape into each square, with triangles for the eyes, nose and mouth (or get creative!)

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your pumpkin pie lids</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Add the chopped garlic and the softened butternut squash cubes and cook for 2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>Knorr vegetable stock cube in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and stir through the crème fraîche

Use one thyme sprig (or a piece of string) to tie a knot around the rest of the thyme sprigs

Tip: This makes it easier to remove the herbs at the end!

Add the creamy stock and tied thyme to the pan and bring to the boil

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 5-6 or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the balsamic vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing

Once the sauce has thickened, remove the tied thyme

Stir in the spinach and crumble in the feta

Gently mash it all together and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your pie filling</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the pumpkin pie lids over the pie filling with the chips and baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle the baby leaf salad with the balsamic dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
