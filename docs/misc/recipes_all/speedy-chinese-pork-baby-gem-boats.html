<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Meanwhile, combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your harissa pork mixture</p><br><br>
