<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dice the mozzarella into small bite-sized pieces and add to some kitchen paper

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into rings

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking up the mince with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the beef is beginning to brown, add the ground paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the ground cumin and chopped garlic

Add a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your sloppy mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the dough balls have rested for 15 min, press your palm into the middle of a dough ball to flatten it until it is twice as wide

Turn the dough over and repeat a few times, until approx. 24cm in diameter

Tip: Use a rolling pin to help you!

Repeat with the other dough ball<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your pizza bases

Transfer the pizza bases to a baking paper-lined baking tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread 2 tbsp finely chopped tomatoes over each pizza base (save the rest for another recipe!) and season with a pinch of salt

Top each pizza with the sloppy mix, diced mozzarella, onion rings, sliced pepper and sprinkle over the dried oregano

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 9-19 min or until the pizza bases are golden and crisp – these are your sloppy Giuseppe pizzas

Tip: Cooking for 4? Do this in batches!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sloppy Giuseppe pizza with a double pinch of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
