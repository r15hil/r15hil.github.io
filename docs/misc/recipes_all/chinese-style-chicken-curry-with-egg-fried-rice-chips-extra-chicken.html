<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potato[es] (skins on) into chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your salt & pepper chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges then separate the wedges into petals

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken (cooking for 4 or more? Use two pans!) and onion petals with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken has started to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Once the chicken has browned, add 25g <span class="text-purple">[40g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[50g]</span> butter to the pan

Once the butter has melted, add the grated carrot, curry powder and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 4 min further until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water, hoisin sauce, half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 3-4 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, dissolve your cornflour in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water

Add the cornflour mixture to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further until the sauce has thickened – this is your Chinese-style chicken curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the cooled rice, toasted sesame oil and remaining soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined

Push the rice to one side of the pot and crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Chinese-style chicken curry with the egg fried rice and salt & pepper chips to the side

Garnish with the sliced green chilli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
