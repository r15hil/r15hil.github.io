<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your orange[s] in half and cut 1 slice per person, then chop the remaining orange[s] into 2 wedges per person

Combine the juice of the orange wedges (reserve the rinds!) with your soy sauce, honey, cornflour, ginger & garlic paste and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your orange sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Pat the chicken thighs dry

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once crisped, add the reserved orange rind to a baking tray

Top with the browned chicken (reserve the pan!)

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your roast chicken & orange rinds</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add the sliced garlic with a knob of butter to a medium pot with a lid and fry for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add your white long grain rice with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat then reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed

Once cooked through remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your garlic rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the orange sauce and orange slices with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> cold water and your sesame seeds, then bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened

Once thickened, set aside for later – this is your sticky orange sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mooli slaw mix with your mayo and the remaining white wine vinegar – this is your mooli slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, return the sticky orange sauce to a medium heat and add the roasted chicken (discard the orange rind!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your sticky orange chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky orange chicken with the garlic rice and mooli slaw to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
