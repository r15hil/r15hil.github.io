<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan, stirring to coat the grains of rice in the oil

Add the chopped tomatoes and stir continuously until the rice has absorbed most of the tomato juice

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 15-20 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your tomato risotto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grind most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your parsley oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop the parsley very finely and mix with olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free chicken strips and cook for 7-8 min or until warmed through and starting to crisp, then season lightly with pepper

Once the risotto is nearly done, add the red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 2 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the cooked meat-free chicken and half the grated cheese to the tomato risotto and gently stir it all together – this is your tomato & meat-free chicken risotto

Serve the tomato & meat-free chicken risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining grated cheese and chopped parsley

Drizzle the parsley oil all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
