<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your portobello mushroom[s] into 8 wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your potato[es] (skins on) into discs

Carefully arrange the potato discs over the top of the pie filling

Season with a pinch of salt and put the dish in the oven for 40 min or until everything's bubbling and the potatoes are cooked through – this is your all-in-one hearty mushroom & lentil pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Combine your salad with your cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl – this is your dressed salad

Season the all-in-one hearty mushroom & lentil pie with a grind of pepper and serve the dressed salad to the side
