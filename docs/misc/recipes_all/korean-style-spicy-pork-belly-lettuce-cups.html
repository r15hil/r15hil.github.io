<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once hot, add the pork belly slices and cook for 15-18 min, turning every couple of minutes until very golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Reduce the heat to medium after approx. 5 min, once the pan gets very hot!</p><br><br>

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil with the sriracha, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!)

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pork is cooked through and crispy, add the dried chilli flakes  (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs further

Add the remaining soy sauce and honey and cook for 1 min further, turning the pork until it's fully coated and sticky – this is your sticky pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the lettuce leaves with some cooked rice, cucumber batons, sticky pork and sliced green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just use a little chilli!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
