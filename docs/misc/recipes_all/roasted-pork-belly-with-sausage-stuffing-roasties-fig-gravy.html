<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season generously with salt and pepper and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern (clean hands is best!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a very high heat

Once hot, add the pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 4 min or until coloured and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side

Cut<span class="text-danger"> </span>a<span class="text-danger"> </span>piece of tin foil approx. the size of A4 paper per pork belly

Lay your thyme and bay leaf[ves] in the middle of each piece of foil, then top with the browned pork (skin-side up), reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Loosely scrunch the edges of the foil around the pork belly joint[s] leaving the skin exposed and add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water around the joint[s]

Transfer the parcel[s] to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 48 - 50 min or until the pork skin is crisp and the meat is cooked through – this is your roasted pork belly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl and break it up with a wooden spoon

Peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add half the chopped garlic to the sausage meat with half the diced onion and a generous grind of black pepper

Mix well until everything is combined, shape into 3 stuffing balls per person, then transfer to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with the chopped potatoes

Season with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the stuffing is cooked through and the potatoes are crisp – this is your sausage stuffing and roasties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the pork has 15 min remaining, reboil a kettle and heat the reserved pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining diced onion and cornflour along with a pinch of pepper, cook for 4-5 min or until softened and caramelised

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and fig relish in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water and mix until fully combined – this is your fig stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has caramelised, add the fig stock and remaining chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your fig gravy

Add your Tenderstem broccoli and chopped carrot to a pot and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the roasted pork belly into strips with a sharp knife

Serve the roasted pork belly slices with the roasties, sausage stuffing and cooked veg to the side

Pour over the fig gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
