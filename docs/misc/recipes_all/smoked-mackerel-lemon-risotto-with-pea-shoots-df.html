<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water and stir in the single soya – this is your creamy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until softened but not browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, stir the arborio rice into the pan, making sure the grains of rice are coated in oil

Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until it has evaporated

Reduce the heat to medium-low</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 1/3 of the creamy stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed into the rice

Continue to add the remaining creamy stock, a ladle at a time, stirring more or less continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the risotto is cooking, cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Peel the skin off the smoked mackerel and discard

Tear the smoked mackerel into small, rough pieces (watch out for small bones!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon

Season very generously with pepper (use much more than you normally would!) – this is your dairy-free smoked mackerel & lemon risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Serve the dairy-free smoked mackerel & lemon risotto in bowls topped with a handful of pea shoots and a lemon wedge

Drizzle the pea shoots with olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
