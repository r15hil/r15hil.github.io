<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your broccoli into small florets

Cut a piece (or two!) of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Lay the broccoli florets in the middle with your toasted sesame oil, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>water and a pinch of salt and add to a baking tray

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the broccoli to form sealed parcel[s]

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine 1/2 tsp per person cornflour (save the rest for later!), your soy sauce and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> water in a bowl and stir it all together

Add your Chinese rice wine and honey and give everything a good mix up – this is your honey sauce

Cut your hake fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces and add them to a bowl, then add the remaining cornflour and give everything a good mix up until the hake is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4<span class="text-danger"> </span>min on each side or until golden – this is your golden hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the hake is golden, transfer it to a plate and set aside for later

Carefully pour away most of the oil and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the honey sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thick and sticky

Once the sauce has thickened, return the golden hake to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the hake is fully coated – this is your General Tso's hake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the General Tso's hake over the cooked rice with the broccoli to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
