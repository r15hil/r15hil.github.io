<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with a grind of black pepper – this is your garlic mayo

Cook for 4-5 min or until the liquid has reduced to a thick gravy-like consistency – this is your Fable mushroom 'brisket'</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill your warm ciabatta with the Fable mushroom 'brisket' and some of the quick-pickled cucumber
