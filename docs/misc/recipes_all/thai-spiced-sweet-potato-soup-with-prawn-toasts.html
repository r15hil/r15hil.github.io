<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper then add the peeled garlic, chopped sweet potato, white potato, carrot and onion wedges

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and grate the remaining garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Drain your king prawns and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Chop the drained prawns on a clean board until they are very finely minced (keep chopping until they become sticky!)

Combine the minced prawns in a bowl with the grated garlic and grated ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim the curved tops off your ciabatta[s] so that you are left with a flat surface, discard the trimmings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice the trimmed ciabattas in half through the middle, then into 4 triangles per person

Spread the minced prawns onto the ciabatta triangles

Press your toasted sesame seeds onto the minced prawns – these are your prawn ciabattas

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the roasted veg is tender, heat a large, wide-based pot over a high heat

Add the red Thai curry paste with the roasted veg, vegetable stock mix, 700ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water and the coriander (save some leaves for garnish!) then bring to the boil

Once boiling, remove the pot from the heat and use a (stick) blender (or add to a food processor) to blitz until smooth, then return to a low heat to keep warm – this is your Thai-style sweet potato soup</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the prawn ciabattas and fry for 3-4 min on each side or until the prawns are cooked through and the toast is golden – these are your prawn toasts

Tip: You may need to do this in batches, or use a second pan!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style sweet potato soup topped with the reserved coriander leaves

Serve the prawn toasts to the side for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
