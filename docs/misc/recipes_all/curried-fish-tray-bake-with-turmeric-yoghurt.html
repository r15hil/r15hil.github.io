<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle 2/3 of your curry powder (save the rest for later!) over the basa and rub it into both sides until evenly coated

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – this is your curried basa</p><br><br>

<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 12-15 min, add the pepper strips and cherry tomatoes to the tray[s]

Sprinkle over the remaining curry powder and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Place the curried basa on top of the vegetables

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through, the potatoes are crisp and the vegetables have softened – this is your one tray curried basa bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, combine your natural yoghurt with your ground turmeric, a small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your turmeric yoghurt</p><br><br>

<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried basa tray bake with the turmeric yoghurt drizzled over the top

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
