<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel your garlic

Add the sliced courgette, onion wedges, tomato wedges, peeled garlic, chicken breast portion[s], harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and honey to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a really good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

Add your giant couscous to a pot with 500ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [650ml] </span>[800ml]</span> boiling water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and rinse briefly under cold running water to remove any excess starch

Set aside for later</p><br><br>

<p>Once the chicken has had an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the cooked giant couscous

Pour the chicken stock over the top and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your honey-harissa chicken breast & courgette tray bake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and natural yoghurt in a bowl with a pinch of salt and a generous crack of black pepper – this is your herby yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the honey-harissa chicken breast & courgette tray bake with a dollop of the herby yoghurt on top

Garnish with chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
