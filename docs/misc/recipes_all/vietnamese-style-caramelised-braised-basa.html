Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sugar has caramelised, add the marinated basa and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

Once browned, add the pepper strips, chopped garlic, chopped ginger, sliced shallot and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cook for 3-4 min or until your fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened – this is your Vietnamese-style caramelised & braised basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Give everything a good mix up – this is your carrot salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your Vietnamese-style caramelised & braised basa with the cooked rice and carrot salad to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
