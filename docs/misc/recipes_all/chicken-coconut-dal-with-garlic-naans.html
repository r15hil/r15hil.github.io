<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the diced carrot to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the carrot has softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and curry powder and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils, coconut stock and a small pinch of salt to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until all the water is absorbed, the lentils are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & coconut dal</p><br><br>
