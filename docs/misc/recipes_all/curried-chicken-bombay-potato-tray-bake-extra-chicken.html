<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop half your brown onion[s] into wedges, then finely slice the remaining brown onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes and onion wedges to one side of the baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle over your ground turmeric, black mustard seeds and half of your curry powder and give everything a good mix up – these are your Bombay potatoes

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add half your garam masala (save the rest for later!) to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add your chicken breast portions to the plate and turn them several times until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After the Bombay potatoes have had an initial 10-12 min add the coated chicken to the other side of the tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 18-20 min, or until the potatoes are crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your curried chicken & Bombay potato tray bake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spring greens, then pat dry with kitchen paper, rip the leaves off and discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into strips

Line a separate baking tray (or two!) with a large piece of tin foil, then add the sliced spring greens to the middle of the foil with a pinch of salt, a knob of butter and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water, then scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel[s] and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the greens are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion has started to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, remaining curry powder and remaining garam masala to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through half of your natural yoghurt – this is your masala sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried chicken & Bombay potato tray bake and with the spring greens to the side

Spoon the masala sauce over the chicken and drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
