<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have been cooking for 30 min, remove them from the oven and carefully turn any so that they're all cut-side up

Top the potatoes evenly with the grated cheese

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-7 min or until the cheese has melted and is beginning to crisp slightly – these are your loaded potatoes</p><br><br>

<p>Remove the pulled pork dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the pork apart using two forks, then add your BBQ sauce and stir it all together

Return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until everything is nice and sticky – this is your BBQ pulled pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the BBQ pulled pork with loaded potatoes and creamy slaw to the side

Sprinkle the chopped chives over the potatoes and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
