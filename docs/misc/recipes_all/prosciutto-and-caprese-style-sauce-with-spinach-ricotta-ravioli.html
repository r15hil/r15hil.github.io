<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your prosciutto slices to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your prosciutto slices every 30 secs to prevent them from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spinach & ricotta ravioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and half the chopped basil (save the rest for later!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and sugar and a grind of black pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has started to thicken</p><br><br>

Chop the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli and chopped mozzarella to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your Caprese-style sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Caprese-style sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli and top with the crispy prosciutto and remaining chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
