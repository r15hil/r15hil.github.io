<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 mayonnaise sachet (30ml)</li>
<li>2 brioche rolls</li>
<li>100g Brussels sprouts</li>
<li>1 camembert (125g)</li>
<li>1 Dijon mustard pot (5.5g)</li>
<li>1 balsamic vinegar sachet (15ml)</li>
<li>3 white potatoes</li>
<li>2 x venison & pork burgers (227g)</li>
<li>1 cranberry sauce pot (40g)</li>
<li>1 garlic clove</li>
<li>1 bag of dried cranberries (30g) </li>
<li>1 red onion</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chunky chips


Add the chunky chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Trim the Brussels sprouts and chop them in half


<span class="text-highlight">Add the chopped sprouts to a food processor and blitz for 30 secs or until finely shredded</span>


Tip: Don't have a food processor? Slice them finely instead!


Add the dried cranberries to a small bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soak</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the shredded sprouts to a colander and pour the remaining boiled water all over them until bright green and wilted, then set aside to steam dry


Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pot and cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until golden and caramelised</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Whilst the onions are cooking, line a baking tray with baking paper</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Add the venison &amp; pork burgers to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!)</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the burgers are cooking, drain the soaked cranberries and chop them finely 


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Add the chopped cranberries and shredded sprouts to a bowl with the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt and pepper 


Give everything a good mix up – this is your sprout &amp; cranberry slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Once the burgers are cooked, slice the mini camembert<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces</span>


Tip: Run your knife under hot water to stop it sticking to the cheese!


<span class="text-highlight">Top each venison &amp; pork burger with a camembert half and add the brioche rolls to the other side of the tray</span>


Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Once the onions have caramelised, add the balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to the onion and cook for 1-2 min further or until the vinegar has been absorbed and the onions are sticky – these are your balsamic onions</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Fill each brioche roll with the balsamic onions, a venison &amp; pork camembert burger and a dollop of cranberry sauce</span>


Serve the sprout &amp; cranberry slaw and chunky chips to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
