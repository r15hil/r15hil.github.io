<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop into thin matchsticks

Slice your cucumber[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Mix the pulled chicken into the pan juices – this is your pulled chicken teriyaki

Drain the quick-pickled vegetables through a sieve

Drain the mangetout</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pulled free range chicken teriyaki over the cooked rice, with the grated carrot, quick-pickled vegetables and mangetout to the side

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
