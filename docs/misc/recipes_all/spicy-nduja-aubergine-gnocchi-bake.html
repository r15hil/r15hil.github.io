<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and cut into quarters, lengthways, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until golden and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the aubergine is roasting, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind to a fine powder

Tip: Don't have a pestle and mortar? Chop them up as finely as you can

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until it begins to release some oil

Add the chopped tomatoes and crushed fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes are starting to soften, add the roasted aubergine and tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your spicy aubergine sauce

Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your gnocchi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Tear over the remaining 'Nduja (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), top with your grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your spicy 'Nduja & aubergine gnocchi bake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the gnocchi is baking, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the balsamic dressing and gently mix together</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve spicy ‘Nduja & aubergine gnocchi bake with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
