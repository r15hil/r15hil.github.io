<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then set them aside and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Slice your sweet pointed pepper[s] into rounds

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped ginger and garlic, diced apricots and a pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min or until the garlic has softened, then add the chicken strips and cook for a further 3-4 min

Add the chopped tomato, pepper rounds, chicken stock and the juice of half your lemon[s] and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Moroccan-style chicken breast & apricot tagine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the tagine is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Fluff the couscous with a fork and add the juice of the remaining lemon

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and half the chopped parsley and mix everything together – this is your herby couscous

Stir the remaining chopped parsley through the Moroccan-style chicken breast & apricot tagine</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Moroccan-style chicken breast & apricot tagine with the herby couscous to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
