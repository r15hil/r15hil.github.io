<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s], then chop the remaining red onion into wedges

Peel and finely grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced onion to a small bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the free range chicken thighs and chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper, onion wedges and 2/3 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your ras el hanout and a drizzle of olive oil to the tray[s] with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the sliced onion in a sieve under the cold running water until it's cool

Once cooled, return it to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir it all together and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled onion

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken and veg are done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the cooked couscous

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Moroccan-style free range chicken traybake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Moroccan-style free range chicken traybake with the garlic yoghurt dolloped over

Garnish with the quick-pickled onion and chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
