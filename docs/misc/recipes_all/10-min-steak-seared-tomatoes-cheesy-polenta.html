<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat the rump steaks dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with olive oil and season both sides with salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side

For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube along with 450ml <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water to a pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, gradually whisk the polenta into the water in a steady stream

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking occasionally, until thickened to a mashed potato-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the polenta is cooking, gently crush the garlic cloves (skins on) with the back of a knife

Chop some of the cherry tomatoes in half

Strip the rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the steaks are done, add them to a plate and set aside to rest

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes and remaining whole cherry tomatoes to the pan along with the rosemary leaves and crushed garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the tomatoes have started to soften

Once softened, add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[50ml]</span> boiled water and a large knob of butter and mix it all together  – this is your pan sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the polenta has thickened, add the clotted cream and grated Italian hard cheese and give it a really good mix up, removing any lumps – this is your cheesy polenta

Finely slice the rested steaks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy polenta in bowls and top with the sliced steak

Pour over the pan sauce and cherry tomatoes and top with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
