<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take a small knob of butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a splash of cold water

Scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed

Add the foil parcel[s] and wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<p>Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into large, rough chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your lamb mince, chopped dates, ground cumin and half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together

Divide the lamb mixture into 4 balls per person

Thread each skewer with the chopped onion and the lamb meatballs, alternating as you go – these are your South African-style lamb & date sosaties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the South African-style lamb & date sosaties to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining curry powder with the softened butter in a bowl and mix it all together, then set aside – this is your curry butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your cider vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Toss through your salad – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the South African-style lamb & date sosaties with the wedges, sweetcorn cobettes and dressed salad to the side

Spoon the curry butter over the sweetcorn cobettes

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
