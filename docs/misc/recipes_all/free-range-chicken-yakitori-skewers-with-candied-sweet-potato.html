<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Soak your skewers in cold water

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces and add to a non-stick baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger

Combine the grated ginger, soy sauce, mirin and half your honey (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl – this is your yakitori sauce

Cut your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then cut half your spring onion[s] into small, bite-sized pieces and slice the rest finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chicken skewers to a separate baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-12 min

Tip: You'll cook these more later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with a pinch of salt and a small splash of your rice vinegar in a small bowl – this is your Japanese-style mayo

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Slice the cucumber halves finely into half moons and add them to a separate bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of salt – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the yakitori sauce to a pot over a medium heat and cook for 5 min or until it becomes thick and sticky – this is your sticky yakitori sauce

Tip: Watch the sauce like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had 10-12 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and brush the sticky yakitori sauce all over the skewers

Drizzle the remaining honey and black sesame seeds over the roasted sweet potato – this is your candied sweet potato

Return the trays to the oven for 8 min further or until they are both caramelised and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the free range chicken yakitori skewers with the candied sweet potato and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the Japanese-style mayo over the sweet potato and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
