<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Add the baby gammon joint to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Use the next 15 min to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the conchiglie has&nbsp;been cooking for&nbsp;6 min, add the garden peas and cook for a further 3 min&nbsp;or until they're cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the conchigle and peas, reserving a cup&nbsp;of the starchy pasta water and keep the pot for the next step</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the baby gammon&nbsp;is done, transfer it to a board and shred it, using two forks &ndash; this technique is known as 'pulling'&nbsp;


Tip: if you don't want to pull the gammon, simply cut it up into bite-size pieces!</p><br><br>
