<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s] and garlic

Chop your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, onion and garlic to a food processor with your roasted peanuts and half the green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and blitz until smooth – this is your nutty stew paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the nutty stew paste with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the paste is cooking, rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the stew paste is fragrant, add your ground turmeric and a knob of butter, then cook for a further 1-2 min

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock, your ground almonds and the tomato wedges to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Then add your haddock bites to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cover with a lid, cook for 7-8 min, turning your haddock bites once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your nutty Brazilian-style haddock stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, chop the remaining green chilli finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the nutty Brazilian-style haddock stew over the cooked rice

Garnish with the chopped green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
