<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut in half lengthways

Slice each half, lengthways, into 5 strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the aubergine strips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the aubergine is golden and softened – these are your smoky aubergine strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is cooked, remove the baking tray[s] from the oven and set the aubergine strips aside (baking paper included!), reserve the baking tray[s]

Add your plain naan[s] to the reserved baking tray[s], splash with a little cold water and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, transfer the naan[s] to a chopping board and cut into strips (careful, they may be hot!)

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, layer the whipped parsley feta with the sliced naan and smoky aubergine strips

Top with the salad and drizzle over the honey mustard dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
