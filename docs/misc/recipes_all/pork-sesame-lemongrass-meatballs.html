<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the broccoli florets and the stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;into bite-size pieces

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle&nbsp;


Bash the lemongrass&nbsp;with a rolling pin, cut it <span class="text-danger">[them]</span>&nbsp;down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add&nbsp;the rice, 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;water and the outer lemongrass layers to a pot (with a lid) and bring it to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, blitz the ginger, garlic, lemongrass stems and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a blender to form a rough paste (alternatively, chop very finely)


Combine the paste, pork mince, breadcrumbs, 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span>&nbsp;sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;soy sauce in a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Spread the sesame seeds out on a plate, roll the meatballs into the seeds to coat them evenly


Heat 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil in a large pan (preferably non-stick)&nbsp;over a high heat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3-4 min or until the meatballs have browned on all sides</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned meatballs to the broccoli tray (keep the pan for later!)


Return the tray to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until the meatballs have cooked through


Check the rice is cooked, and once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the pan to a medium heat, add the honey, 150ml <span class="text-danger">[220ml]</span>&nbsp;water and the remaining soy sauce


Bring to the boil, whisk to combine and boil until reduced to a runny glaze


Tip:&nbsp;remove the pan from the heat occasionally to prevent it from over-reducing


Once done, remove from the heat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the lemongrass layers from the cooked rice and fluff with a fork


Serve the meatballs over the rice with the broccoli to the side


Drizzle the glaze over the meatballs&nbsp;


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
