Once hot, add the chopped garlic and shallot and cook for 30 secs

Remove the pan from the heat and let the garlic infuse the olive oil – this is your garlic & shallot oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomato and parsley to a bowl with the garlic & shallot oil (reserve the pan)

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and season generously with salt and pepper

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the haddock bites with a knob of butter and cook for 5 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Add a large knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt to the pot with the drained potatoes, and crush them lightly with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the pan-fried haddock over the crushed potatoes with the tomato relish to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
