<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s], then chop the remaining red onion into wedges

Peel and finely grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced onion to a small bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside – this is your softened sliced onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chicken thighs and chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper, onion wedges and 2/3 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your ras el hanout and a drizzle of olive oil to the tray[s] with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt with the remaining grated garlic in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>
