<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the noodles are soaking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go or until starting to brown and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork is browning, peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Cut your orange[s] in half, then peel and roughly chop half the orange[s] and set aside

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped orange in a small bowl with your tamarind paste, honey and soy sauce

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and fish sauce with the juice of the remaining orange and give everything a good mix up – this is your orange nam jim sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky nam jim pork & orange udon noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and chop your Thai basil roughly over the top with scissors

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
