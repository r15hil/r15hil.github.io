<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Peel and finely slice your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a small dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the orzo has been cooking for 5 min, add the halved green beans and cook, covered, for a further 5 min

Add the halved Tenderstem and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until everything's tender with a slight bite

Tip: Add a splash more water if your orzo is looking a little dry, and stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, add a knob of butter, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a very generous grind of black pepper

Wash your spinach, then add it to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until wilted

Add half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony orzo primavera

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the lemony orzo primavera with the sliced chicken to the side

Top with the remaining grated Italian cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, the toasted pine nuts and season with a grind of black pepper

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
