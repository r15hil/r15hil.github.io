<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably nonstick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

When the pan with the vegetable oil is hot, add the diced chicken thigh with the sun-dried tomato paste and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown

Once the other pan is hot, add the gnocchi and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cook the gnocchi for 4-5 min or until golden and starting to crisp

Tip: Give the gnocchi a shake in the pan once in a while to make sure they are crisping all over!

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has started to brown, remove the pan from the heat, then add the spinach and halved cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and black pepper

Return the pan to the heat, then cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>
