<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Meanwhile, combine the diced chicken thigh in a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt – this is your coated chicken

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, cut your lime[s] in half

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Dissolve your tomato paste and soy sauce in 75ml<span class="text-purple"> [110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your chicken tinga</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your mayo with the juice of half your lime[s] in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, stir through the drained black beans and season with a pinch of salt – this is your beany rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beany rice in a bowl with the chicken tinga, shredded lettuce and grated cheese to the side

Drizzle over the lime mayo and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
