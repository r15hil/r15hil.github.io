<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the sliced garlic to the pan with the bacon and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Watch the garlic like a hawk to make sure it doesn’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>reserved starchy pasta water and stir in your soft cheese – this is your creamy stock

Once fragrant, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the creamy stock and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken – this is your creamy bacon Alfredo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the cooled spinach as you can, then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tagliatelle and chopped wilted spinach to the creamy bacon Alfredo sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy bacon Alfredo sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy bacon Alfredo sauce with fresh tagliatelle topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
