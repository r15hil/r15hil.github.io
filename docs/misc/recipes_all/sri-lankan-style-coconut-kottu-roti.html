<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced carrot and cook for 4-5 min or until it's beginning to soften

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice as finely as you can

Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Add the sliced spring greens, drained chickpeas and soy sauce to the pan with a small splash of water and cook, covered for 5-6 min or until the greens have wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add the chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), coconut flakes and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime to a food processor with a pinch of salt and sugar and blitz into a rough paste – this is your spicy sambal

Tip: Alternatively finely chop everything with a sharp knife!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the curry powder (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with the coconut yoghurt and 120ml<span class="text-danger"> [180ml]</span> boiled water and mix everything together – this is your coconut sauce

Add the coconut sauce to the pan and stir together until everything is fully coated – this is your Sri Lankan-style coconut kottu roti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Sri Lankan-style coconut kottu roti in bowls with the spicy sambal dolloped to the side

Tear over the coriander and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
