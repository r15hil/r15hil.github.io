<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly browned all over

Tip: Unevenly sized diced chicken breast? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar, your ground paprika, half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the gochujang stock

Stir it all together and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Korean-style glazed chicken</p><br><br>

<p>Load up the warmed tortillas with the sesame slaw and Korean-style glazed chicken

Drizzle over any remaining glaze and top with the sliced spring onion greens and your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
