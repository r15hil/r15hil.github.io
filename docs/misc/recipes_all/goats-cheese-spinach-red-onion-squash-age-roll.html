<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, strip your thyme leaves from their stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add half the thyme leaves, half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and reduce the heat to low

Cook for 10-12 min or until the onion has caramelised and the sauce has become sticky

Once done, set aside to cool slightly – this is your red onion chutney

Tip: Cooling will help to thicken the chutney!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until the butternut squash cubes are fork-tender

Once tender, roughly mash the cooked butternut squash with a fork

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the spinach to the bowl with the mashed butternut squash and return it to the microwave for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, add your goats cheese with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your goats cheese, spinach & butternut squash filling

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then cut into rectangles for per person and add them to a separate baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Add the red onion chutney to the centre of the pastry rectangles, lengthways, then top with the goats cheese, spinach & butternut squash filling</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, then use a fork to crimp along the edge

Brush the pastry with milk and sprinkle over the remaining thyme leaves

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your goats cheese, spinach & red onion butternut squash rolls</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the goats cheese, spinach & red onion butternut squash roll with the chips and salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil, the remaining balsamic vinegar and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
