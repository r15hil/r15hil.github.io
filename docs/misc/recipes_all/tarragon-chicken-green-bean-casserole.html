<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>5g basil</li>
<li>11g chicken stock mix</li>
<li>80g fine green beans</li>
<li>1 ciabatta roll</li>
<li>3 white potatoes</li>
<li>320g British chicken thighs</li>
<li>80g spinach</li>
<li>1 pot of Cornish clotted cream (40g)</li>
<li>1 garlic clove</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water - this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min further</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Return the chicken thighs to the pan and add the chopped potatoes

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Chop the green beans in half

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the chicken thighs from the pan and transfer to a clean board

Add the chopped basil, green beans and spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the beans are tender

Add the ciabatta slices to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're golden and crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Shred the cooked chicken apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once everything is tender, add the clotted cream to the pan with the shredded chicken

Give everything a good mix up and season with a very generous pinch of pepper – this is your basil chicken & green bean casserole</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the basil chicken & green bean casserole in bowls with the warmed ciabatta slices to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
