<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your lean beef mince and grated onion to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, half the chopped garlic, half your ground coriander and half your garam masala (you'll use the rest later!)

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 3 koftas per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the koftas to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the koftas have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the koftas are cooking, crush half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife (save the rest for later!)

Discard the outer green pods

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 120ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the remaining chopped garlic with the remaining ground coriander, remaining garam masala, chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cardamom seeds

Cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to break down

Once broken down, add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, return the browned koftas to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Bangladeshi-style lean beef kofta curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice with the remaining cardamom pods, your bay leaf[ves], a pinch of<span class="text-danger"> </span>salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Bangladeshi-style lean beef kofta curry in a bowl with the fragrant rice to the side, discard the cardamom pods and bay leaf[ves]

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
