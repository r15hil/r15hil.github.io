<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Take some butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften, then boil half a kettle

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the yeast is developing, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your tomato paste and chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the yeast has developed, add your pizza base mix, nigella seeds and half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 60ml <span class="text-purple">[80ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 20 secs, then set aside – this is your naan dough</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned

Once browned, add the sliced onion and cook for a further 2-3 min or until golden

Meanwhile, combine 1/3 of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with the softened butter and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your garlic butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once golden, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining chopped garlic, ground turmeric, ground cumin and garam masala and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the tomato stock with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your chicken bhuna curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut the naan dough into 1 ball per person, then roll each dough ball out with a rolling pin into a circular disc – this is your naan

Transfer the chicken bhuna curry to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with the naan

Tip: Only have one oven-proof dish? Leave the naan dough whole and roll out to the size of your dish!

Put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until the naan is cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, brush each naan with some garlic butter – this is your garlic naan topped chicken bhuna pie

Once the pie is almost ready, reboil a kettle

Trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic naan topped chicken bhuna pie with the green beans to the side

Serve the remaining natural yoghurt in a pot to the side to drizzle all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
