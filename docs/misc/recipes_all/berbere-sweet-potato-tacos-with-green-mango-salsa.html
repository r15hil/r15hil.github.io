<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your sweet potato[es] into wedges

Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with your berbere seasoning and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the wedges are in the oven, peel and chop 2/3 of your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Slice the remaining red onion finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your lime[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the sliced onion to a small bowl and squeeze the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime half[ves] over

Add a pinch of salt and sugar, then place the squeezed lime half[ves] on top for added pickling – this is your lime quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the wedges have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the red onion wedges with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), then add a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and mix everything together

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min or until everything is tender – these are your berbere vegetables

While the vegetables are cooking, cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your coriander (reserve a few leaves for garnish!), remaining chopped garlic, ginger paste and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor

Add your cumin seeds and the juice of the remaining lime half[ves] with a generous drizzle of olive oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and blitz until a sauce remains – this is your green chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh roughly, discarding the stone[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the diced mango and green chilli sauce in a bowl – this is your green mango salsa

When the vegetables are almost ready, add your seeded tortillas to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide your mayo equally between the seeded tortillas with the berbere vegetables

Top with the green mango salsa and any remaining green chilli sauce – these are your berbere sweet potato tacos with green mango salsa

Sprinkle over the lime quick-pickled onions and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
