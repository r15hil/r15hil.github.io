<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and sliced onion to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and sugar and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until the chicken is starting to brown and the onion is starting to soften and caramelise

Meanwhile, heat a pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add your nigella seeds and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains in oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the rice, increase the heat to high and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant basmati rice

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your tomatoes into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced pepper to the softened onion and chicken and cook for a further 5-8 min or until starting to brown

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and curry powder to the pan and stir until everything is coated in spice

Stir your tomato paste into the pan, then add the tomato wedges and  chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 5-10 min or until the sauce has reduced and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) - this is your chicken thigh jalfrezi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the fragrant basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed and serve the chicken thigh jalfrezi with the fragrant basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
