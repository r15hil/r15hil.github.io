<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, increase the heat to high, then add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for a further 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once browned, add the chopped garlic, ground coriander, cumin seeds, half your ground smoked paprika  (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then cook for a further 2 min or until fragrant and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the pork is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred
