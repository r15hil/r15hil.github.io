<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper, 2/3 of the ground smoked paprika and half the dried basil (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion softens, peel and grate half the garlic, then finely slice (don't chop!) the remaining garlic

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the vegan mayo with the remaining dried basil, remaining ground smoked paprika, grated garlic and 1/3 of the white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) – this is your smoky ranch dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the diced pepper and sliced garlic to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

Once browned, add the remaining white wine vinegar to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water, then stir in the mustard ketchup and Henderson's Relish – this is your mustard ketchup stock

Add the mustard ketchup stock to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced and the sauce is glossy – this is your meat-free sloppy joe mixture</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, add a layer of fries to a plate and top with the meat-free sloppy joe mixture – these are your meat-free sloppy joe loaded fries

Dollop over the smoky ranch dressing and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
