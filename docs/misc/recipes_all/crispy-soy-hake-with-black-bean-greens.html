<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>80g Tenderstem broccoli</li>
<li>4 tbsp cornflour</li>
<li>2 hake fillets</li>
<li>130g white long grain rice</li>
<li>15g fresh root ginger</li>
<li>10ml toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>40g black bean paste</li>
<li>80g spinach</li>
<li>1 spring onion</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>8ml soy sauce</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely slice the ginger, then chop into matchsticks as finely as you can

Combine the black bean paste with 25ml <span class="text-danger">[50ml]</span> cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your black bean sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add the hake fillets to a plate and drizzle the soy sauce all over them

Turn the hake several times until the soy sauce fully soaks into the fish

Sprinkle the cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated, then set aside for later

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Lay the spinach, Tenderstem broccoli and half of the sliced ginger and garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in the middle with the toasted sesame oil and black bean sauce

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the vegetables to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – these are your black bean greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced ginger and garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once crispy, transfer them to a bowl and set aside – this is your crispy ginger & garlic</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to the heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden, crisp and cooked through – this is your crispy soy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy soy hake with the cooked rice and black bean greens to the side and pour any remaining black bean sauce over the greens

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Sprinkle the crispy ginger & garlic and sliced spring onion over the crispy soy hake and rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
