<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid and cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Heat a seperate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the pepper is cooking, drain and rinse your black beans

Once the pepper has slightly softened, add the drained black beans to the pan with your roasted garlic paste, ground cumin and ground smoked paprika

Give everything a good mix up, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Add your tomato paste to the pan with 80ml <span class="text-purple">[105ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[135ml]</span> boiled water, your cooked white long grain rice and your vegetable stock mix

Mix it all together and cook for 3-4 min or until the rice is warmed through – this is your taco rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Crumble your feta roughly

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

Top the taco rice with the crumbled feta and grated cheese and cook for a final 1 min or until the cheese has slightly melted – this is your double cheese taco rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your soured cream to a small bowl with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Stir once or twice to swirl the chipotle paste through the soured cream – this is your chipotle soured cream</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the double cheese taco rice with chipotle soured cream dolloped over and the cooked chicken to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
