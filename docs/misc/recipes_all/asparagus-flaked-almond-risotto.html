<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 1/3 of the vegetable stock and stir continuously until the stock has been absorbed into the rice

Add the asparagus rounds, then continue to add the remaining vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto</p><br><br>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
