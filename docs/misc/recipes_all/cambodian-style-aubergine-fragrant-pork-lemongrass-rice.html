<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 and boil half a kettle

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until very tender

Once cooked, carefully cut a slit down the centre of each aubergine with a sharp knife, taking care not to cut all the way through – this is your roasted aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and set aside, then chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, the outer lemongrass layers, a generous pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large-wide based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 6-7 min or until nicely browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the pork is browning, combine your hoisin sauce with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>boiled water

Add your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your hoisin stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pork is browned, add the chopped garlic to the pan with the chopped lemongrass, chopped ginger and chopped coriander stems

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the hoisin stock, mix it all together and cook for 3-4 min or until it's reduced to a bolognese-like consistency and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fragrant pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the roast aubergine with the fragrant pork – this is your Cambodian-style aubergine

Serve the Cambodian-style aubergine with the lemongrass rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
