<p><strong>Description:</strong> Black garlic sounds scary, but it's just a type of caramelised garlic, made by heating whole bulbs very slowly over the course of several weeks. The result is a soft, squidgy clove that has a sweet, balsamic flavour. Perfect for adding instant umami to a burger! We've served ours with charred lettuce and a black mayo. Welcome to the dark side!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove&nbsp;half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span>&nbsp;of the black garlic cloves from the bulb&nbsp;


Chop the black garlic as finely as you can (it will be squidgy!)


Combine the beef mince and black garlic in a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Tip: you want the black garlic to be evenly distributed throughout the mince&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Massage the mince with clean hands for a minute (this helps them hold their shape whilst cooking)&nbsp;


Divide&nbsp;and shape the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>&nbsp;patties (make them slightly larger than the width of the brioche rolls as they shrink when they cook) and put them in the freezer (chilling the meat helps them hold their shape too) until step 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat


Cut the brioche rolls in half&nbsp;


Once&nbsp;hot, add the brioche cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted&nbsp;


Once toasted, set aside until serving and reserve the pan&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>&nbsp;


Wash the little gem lettuce and remove 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>&nbsp;whole outer leaves and set aside for serving


Cut the little gem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in half, lengthways


Return the pan to a high heat, add the lettuce, cut-side down and cook&nbsp;for 2 min, then transfer to serving plates, reserving the pan&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil


Once hot, add the patties and cook for 3 min on one side only


Meanwhile, cut the cheese in half&nbsp;


Flip&nbsp;the patties and add a piece of cheese to each pattie, cover and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the cheese has started to melt

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the Henderson's relish with the mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper - this is your black mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble your burgers with the lettuce leaves, tomato and mayo and top with the patty


Serve the grilled gem to side and drizzle them with the vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil&nbsp;


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
