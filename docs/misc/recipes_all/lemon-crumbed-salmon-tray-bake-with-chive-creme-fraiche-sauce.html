<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] roughly

Combine the chopped potato and chopped carrot on a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes and carrots are cooking, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half

Combine the lemon zest, panko breadcrumbs and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your chives finely

Add the chopped chives to a pestle & mortar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and the juice of half the lemon[s] and grind everything until you're left with a green oil – this is your chive oil

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Once the potatoes and carrots have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved Tenderstem</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Place your salmon fillet[s] on top of the vegetables, drizzle with a little olive oil and top with the lemon breadcrumbs

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 14-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through, the vegetables are tender and the breadcrumbs are golden – this is your lemon crumbed salmon tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your crème fraîche, chive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water to a small pot and cook over a low heat for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your chive & crème fraîche sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chive & crème fraîche sauce to one side of the plate and top with the lemon crumbed salmon

Serve the roasted vegetables to the side and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
