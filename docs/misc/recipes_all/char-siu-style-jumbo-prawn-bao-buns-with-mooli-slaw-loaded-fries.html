<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the fries are nearly done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain, then add your jumbo prawns to a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and mix together until the prawns are fully coated

Once hot, add the coated jumbo prawns to the pan and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the prawns are golden, add the char siu-style sauce to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened and the prawns are cooked through – these are your char siu-style jumbo prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the char siu-style jumbo prawns and top with some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo and garnish with half of the crispy onions and coriander leaves (save the rest for later!) – these are your char siu-style jumbo prawn bao buns</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the char siu-style jumbo prawn bao buns with the fries and remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw to the side

Load up the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo, crispy onions and coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
