<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and cut your potato[es] and sweet potato[es] into fries – these are your mixed fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the mixed fries to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your basa fillet[s] in half lengthways

Slice each half into 2 pieces (roughly the size and shape of fish fingers) so that you are left with 4 basa strips per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a bowl

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with your ground paprika, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Coat the basa strips in the flour, tap off any excess, then add it into the milk and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the breaded basa strips to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your fish goujons

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, combine your tomato ketchup in a bowl with your curry powder, Henderson's Relish and a pinch of salt – this is your curry ketchup

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Only use half of the ketchup and save the rest for later!</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Once everything is almost ready, add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fish goujons with the mixed fries, peas and curry ketchup to the side

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Serve the reserved ketchup to the side instead of the curry ketchup!</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
