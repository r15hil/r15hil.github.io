<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook your food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n with your soy sauce and the juice of half your lemon[s] (you'll use the rest later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika over the meat-free chick'n and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until warmed through – this is your Mediterranean-style meat-free chick'n</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the meat-free chick'n is cooking, roughly dice your tomato[es]

Chop half your cucumber (you'll use the rest later!) into small, bite-sized pieces

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the diced tomato and chopped cucumber in a bowl with half the chopped parsley, half your ground sumac (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek-style salad

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Combine your mayo and grated cucumber in a bowl with the remaining lemon juice, the remaining ground sumac and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tzatziki mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Dress the shredded lettuce with a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load up the warmed naan with the Greek-style salad and Mediterranean-style meat-free chick'n

Dollop over the tzatziki mayo and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Serve the dressed shredded lettuce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
