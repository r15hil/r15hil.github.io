Finely slice 1/2 your red chilli[es] into rounds and set them aside for garnish

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half, separating the tips from the stems

Sliced your sugar snap peas in half

Once the aubergine has softened, add your Thai green curry paste, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped ginger to the pan with the aubergine and cook for 2 min</p><br><br>

Add the juice of 1/2 your lime[s], your lime leaves and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix to combine – this is your aromatic stock</p><br><br>
