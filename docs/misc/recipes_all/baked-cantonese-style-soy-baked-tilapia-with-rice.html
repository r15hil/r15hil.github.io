<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Tip: Cooking for 4? Spread your ingredients out over two smaller dishes to avoid overcrowding!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Trim, then chop the green beans in half

Add the chopped green beans to a baking paper-lined oven-proof dish (or deep baking tray) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice to a separate oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the ginger & garlic paste with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, the soy sauce and Chinese rice wine in a small bowl – this is your seasoned soy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>into rounds

Strip the coriander leaves from the stems, discard the stems

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the green beans have been cooking for 10 min, remove the dish from the oven and top with the spinach

Pour the seasoned soy sauce all over and top with the tilapia fillets

Return the dish to the oven for 12-15 min further or until the veg is tender and the fish is cooked through – this is your baked Cantonese-style soy tilapia

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the baked Cantonese-style soy tilapia with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a handful of coriander leaves

Serve the baked rice to the side

Drizzle any remaining seasoned soy sauce from the dish all over

Let everyone dig in!</p><br><br>
