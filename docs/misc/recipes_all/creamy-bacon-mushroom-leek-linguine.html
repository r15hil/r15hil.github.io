<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle and chop your smoked streaky bacon roughly

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 5-6 min, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer to kitchen paper and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the bacon is cooking, slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Wash your leek[s] carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Return the pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are beginning to soften, add a knob of butter to the pan with the sliced leek and a pinch of salt

Cook for a further 5-7 min or until everything's softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Once the vegetables have softened, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy leek & mushroom linguine topped with the grated cheese and crispy bacon

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
