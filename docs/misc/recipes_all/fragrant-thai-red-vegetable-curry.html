<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>160g butternut squash cubes</li>
<li>1 tsp ground paprika</li>
<li>15g crispy onions</li>
<li>15g fresh root ginger</li>
<li>5.5g vegetable stock mix</li>
<li>40g red Thai curry paste</li>
<li>15ml soy sauce</li>
<li>130g basmati rice</li>
<li>50g creamed coconut</li>
<li>80g mangetout</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>1 lime</li>
<li>1 pepper</li>
<li>1 brown onion</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min <span class="text-danger">[7-9 min]</span> or until the squash is fork-tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add the sliced onion to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, or until starting to soften

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until starting to soften</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the basmati rice, 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Add the soy sauce and a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the red Thai curry paste to the pan with the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and ground paprika

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock and mangetout to the pan and cook, covered, for 5 min or until starting to thicken

Add the cooked butternut squash to the pan and cook, uncovered, for a final 3-4 min, or until the sauce has thickened and the mangetout has slightly softened

Remove from the heat, add the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime – this is your Thai red vegetable curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Serve the Thai red vegetable curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the crispy onions and lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
