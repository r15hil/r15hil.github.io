<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your sausages to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add the carrot and parsnip batons to the other side of the tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!) with a drizzle of olive oil, half your dried sage (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of pepper

Give the vegetables a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender then drain and leave to steam dry (reserve the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice your red onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of sugar and 50ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> [100ml] </span>cold water

Cook for 7-8 min or until soft and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once the onion is soft, add a small knob of butter to the pan

Once the butter has melted, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until the onion is coated in the flour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion is coated in the flour, add your beef stock mix to the pan with your cranberry sauce and 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Cook for 3-4 min further or until slightly thickened – this is your cranberry gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add a knob of butter to the reserved pot with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>milk, the remaining dried sage and a pinch of salt

Cook over a low heat until the butter has melted and the milk is warmed through

Once the milk is warmed through, add the drained potato and mash until smooth – this is your sage mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausages over the sage mash with the roast parsnip & carrot to the side

Pour the cranberry gravy all over and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
