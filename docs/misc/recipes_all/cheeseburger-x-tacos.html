<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potato[es] (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined tray with your ground smoked paprika, a little drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a little water in a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the fries have been cooking for 15 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 6 min or until cooked through and slightly crisp (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked through and slightly crisp, gently push the cooked mince into the centre of pan

Top the mince with the grated cheddar and cook, covered, for a final 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a baking tray

Put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)

Drain the quick-pickled onion and discard the liquid</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load each warmed tortilla with a dollop of spicy burger sauce, (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) some shredded lettuce and chopped tomato

Top with a handful of smoky fries, cheesy beef and quick-pickled onion – these are your cheeseburger x tacos

Serve any remaining spicy burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
