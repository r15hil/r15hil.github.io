<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and the chopped carrot to the dish with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a stir, breaking the mince up with a wooden spoon and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with your toasted sesame oil, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sesame rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

After 15 min add your Tenderstem broccoli and cook covered for a further 10 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your oven-baked honey & soy lean beef</p><br><br>
