<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes in half, add to a heatproof bowl and cover with cling film

Cook in the microwave for 4 min or until slightly softened

Add the softened potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are in the microwave, heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs to the dish with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, tear your white cup mushrooms roughly into the dish and add the crushed garlic, give everything a good mix up

Add your chicken stock mix with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and your Chinese rice wine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for an initial 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After 25 min, add your blanched peas and soft cheese to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for a final 5 min or until the peas are warmed through – this is your one-pot creamy chicken thigh & vegetable fricassée</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are golden, remove the tray from the oven and crush the potatoes firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a plate

Add a knob of butter, season with pepper and mix it all together

Return the tray to the oven, for a final 2 min – these are your buttery crushed potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, set the one-pot creamy chicken thigh & vegetable fricassée in the centre of the table

Serve the buttery crushed potatoes to the side
