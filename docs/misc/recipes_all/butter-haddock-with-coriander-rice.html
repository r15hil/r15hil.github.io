Add your vegetable stock mix with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once reduced, top the sauce with your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with a pinch of salt – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the haddock is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your clotted cream – this is your butter haddock

Tip: Stir gently so that your fish doesn't break apart!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the butter haddock over the coriander rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
