<p><strong>Description:</strong> This traybake twist on a kyiv isn't just easy, it's lower in calories and fat.

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your chives finely

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Combine your panko breadcrumbs with the lemon zest, half the chopped chives (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once everything is starting to soften, add your chicken breast portion[s] to the tray[s] over the veg

Squeeze the juice of half the lemon[s] over the chicken and top with the herby crumb

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 15 min

Cut the remaining lemon into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>wedge per person</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the grated garlic and cook for 1 min

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Once the chicken has had and initial 15 min, add the shredded spring greens to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the spring greens are wilted</p><br><br>

Serve the chicken kyiv with the shredded spring greens and crispy potatoes to the side
