Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once slightly softened, add the grated ginger & garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the garlic and ginger are cooking, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the curry powder, ground turmeric and a pinch of salt to the onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato paste, most of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 1 min

Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken – this is your lighter Goan-style curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, wash the spinach, then chop it roughly

Add the chopped spinach to the curry sauce and stir continuously for 1-2 min or until wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the spinach is wilting, cut the basa fillets into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to the curry and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until cooked through – this is your lighter Goan-style basa & spinach curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks, then stir it through the brown rice with a pinch of salt – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lighter Goan-style basa & spinach curry over the coriander rice and garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
