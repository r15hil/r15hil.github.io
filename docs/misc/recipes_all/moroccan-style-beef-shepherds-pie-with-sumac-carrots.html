<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once softened, turn the heat up to high, then add your lamb mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water with your Henderson's Relish – this is your tangy tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the lamb has browned, reduce the heat to medium, then add your ras el hanout with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt to the pan, mix well and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tangy tomato stock with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the lamb is cooking, top, tail and cut your carrots into quarters, lengthways (peeling is optional)

Add the carrot quarters to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over your ground sumac and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until tender and slightly charred – these are your sumac carrots</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter, season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

Once the spiced lamb mixture has thickened, transfer it to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Top with the mashed potato and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 18-20 min or until golden brown, bubbling and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Moroccan-style lamb cottage pie</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Moroccan-style lamb cottage pie with the sumac carrots to the side

Sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley over the carrots

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
