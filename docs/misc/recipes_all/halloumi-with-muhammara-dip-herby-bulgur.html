<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Add your pepper[s] (leave them whole!) to a baking tray (no need for oil) and cook for 20-25 min or until the skin is slightly blackened

Tip: This gives the pepper a nice smoky flavour!

Once done, remove the blackened pepper from the oven, slice in half and set aside to cool</p><br><br>

Add the juice of the remaining lemon and half of the chopped herbs (save the rest for garnish!)

Tip: Use the back of a spoon to spread the dip on the plate

Top with the golden halloumi

Garnish with the remaining chopped herbs and walnuts and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
