<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook the onions, stirring frequently, until ready to serve or until they have softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the burger is cooking, combine your mayo with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl and season with salt and pepper – this is your chipotle mayo</p><br><br>

Remove the outer lettuce leaves for one per person and set them aside for serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the patty[ies] are almost cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray, cut side up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the brioche is warmed through and slightly toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, top each toasted brioche base with a reserved lettuce leaf, a generous dollop of chipotle mayo, a meat-free patty, caramelised onions and a toasted brioche lid – this is your chipotle meat-free burger with caramelised onions

Serve any remaining chipotle mayo with the chips and crisp lettuce salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
