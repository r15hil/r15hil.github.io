<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your oregano potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the side of your free range chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Open the chicken out like a book and fill the pocket[s] with the sun-dried tomato stuffing, then press firmly to seal the chicken – this is your stuffed chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then add your green beans to a pot and cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once tender, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt – these are your buttered green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cypriot-style stuffed free range chicken with the oregano potatoes and buttered green beans to the side
