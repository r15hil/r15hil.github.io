<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes into quarters and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a pinch of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until they’re beginning to break down</p><br><br>

Go easy!) and half your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a grind of black pepper to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your cannellini beans then add them to the pan with your finely chopped tomatoes, the tomato stock and a generous pinch of salt

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the bean stew has thickened slightly, stir the spinach through and cook with a lid on, for 2-3 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your Italian bean stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Toss your roast potatoes with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining dried oregano

Top the roast potatoes with the torn mozzarella and put the tray back in the oven for 6-7 min or until the cheese is golden and bubbling – these are your cheesy roast potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Italian bean stew with the cheesy roast potatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
