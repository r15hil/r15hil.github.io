<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s] and carrot[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Separate your coriander leaves from their stems, then finely chop the stems (save the leaves for garnish!)

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!), chipotle paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander stems to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix well until fully combined, then divide the mixture into 3 per person and shape them into meatballs

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are browning, add the chopped onion, carrot and pepper to a food processor and blitz until smooth

Boil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Return the pan and any remaining oil to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the blitzed vegetables, halved cherry tomatoes, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste – this is your tomato stock

Once the vegetables have softened, add the tomato stock to the pan

Return the meatballs to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 12-15 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your smoky chipotle lean pork meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While everything's cooking, grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chipotle lean pork meatballs over the drained spaghetti

Top with the grated cheese and coriander leaves

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
