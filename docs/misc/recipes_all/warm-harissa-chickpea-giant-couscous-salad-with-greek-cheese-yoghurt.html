<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a dry pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!)

Once toasted, transfer to a bowl and set aside until serving (reserve the pot!) – these are your toasted pumpkin seeds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your giant couscous and butternut squash cubes to the reserved pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 8 min or until the couscous and squash are tender with a slight bite, then drain and set aside (reserve the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Drain and rinse your chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your red wine vinegar to a bowl with half your harissa paste (you'll use the rest later!) a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar and stir it all together – this is your harissa dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the drained chickpeas with your roasted garlic paste and remaining harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the cooked couscous & butternut squash to the pot with your vegetable stock mix and give everything a good mix up until everything is coated in the harissa

Once coated, remove the pot from the heat and add the chopped lettuce with a pinch of salt and toss – this is your warm harissa chickpea & giant couscous salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, spread your Greek cheese yoghurt on the bottom of your plate and top with the warm harissa chickpea & giant couscous salad

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds and drizzle over the harissa dressing (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
