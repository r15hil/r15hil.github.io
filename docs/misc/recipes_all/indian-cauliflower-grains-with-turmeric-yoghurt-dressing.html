<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with the sultanas and plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, cut the cauliflower into small florets (save the leaves!)

Add the cauliflower florets to a bowl with the curry powder and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give it a good mix up – this is your curried cauliflower</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the curried cauliflower to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender

Once the cauliflower is almost cooked, add the cashew nuts and cauliflower leaves to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and return it to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the nuts are toasted

Tip: Watch the nuts like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the cauliflower is cooking, peel, then slice the shallots as finely as you can

Add the sliced shallots to a small bowl with the cider vinegar and a pinch of salt, then set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled shallots</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the natural yoghurt with the ground turmeric, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the pickling liquid from the shallots and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your turmeric yoghurt dressing

Drain and rinse the green lentils

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the sultana rice to a medium heat and add the drained lentils and spinach

Cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and most of the spinach has wilted

Remove the pot from the heat and add the chopped mint, coriander and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Drain the quick-pickled shallots and add them to the rice with a pinch of salt and stir it all together – these are your herby grains</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted curried cauliflower over the herby grains

Drizzle the turmeric yoghurt dressing all over and garnish with the toasted cashew nuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
