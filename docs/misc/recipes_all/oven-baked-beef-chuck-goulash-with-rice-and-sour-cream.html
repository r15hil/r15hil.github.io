<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced beef to the dish with a pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour, onion wedges, pepper strips, chopped carrot and ground smoked paprika to the dish and give it a good mix up

Add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water, your beef stock mix, tomato paste and your Henderson's Relish

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the goulash has had 30 min in the oven, reboil a kettle

Add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with a generous pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the oven baked beef goulash with the basmati rice to the side and dollop over your soured cream

Dig in!</p><br><br>
