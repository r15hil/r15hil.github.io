<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to wash the grains!) and set aside to drain

Add the drained rice and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the rice from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your ginger & garlic paste to a small bowl with your miso, gluten free soy sauce, half of your mirin (you'll use the rest for later!), shichimi togarashi (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a squeeze of lime juice (save most of it for later!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your miso marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your salmon fillet[s] into 6 bite-sized pieces per person

Add the salmon pieces to a bowl with half of the miso marinade (save the rest for later!) and gently mix until all of the salmon is coated and set aside to marinate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your cucumber in half lengthways and finely dice

Slice your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s] and remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin and chop into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped avocado and diced cucumber to a bowl with the juice of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>remaining lime[s] and your sesame seeds – this is your sesame avo salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your spring onion[s] into 6 batons per person

Thread each skewer with 3 marinated salmon pieces and 3 spring onion batons – these are your miso salmon skewers

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the miso salmon skewers and cook for 4 min on each side, until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily

Add the remaining miso marinade to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly thickened

Once the rice is done, stir through the remaining mirin with a pinch of salt – this is your sticky rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the miso salmon skewers over the sticky rice with the sesame avo salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
