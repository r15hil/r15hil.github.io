<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle with your black mustard seeds, a couple of small knobs of butter and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span>[4 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form 1 sealed parcel per person and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-14 min or until the greens are tender – these are your mustardy greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whist the greens are in the oven, add your cod fillet[s] to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-7 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

While the fish is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chopped shallot and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened, then add the chopped garlic and chopped ginger and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your ground turmeric, curry powder, half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until everything is covered in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your coconut curry sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked cod over the basmati rice with the mustardy greens to the side

Pour the coconut curry sauce on the fish and tear your coriander over the top

Garnish with the remaining dried chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
