<h4>Step 1</h4>

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced onion and leek and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

<p>Top, tail, and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a splash of cold water and a knob of butter

Combine 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>milk and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water in a measuring jug with your umami seasoning, Marmite and vegetable stock mix – this is your umami stock

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Top the pie mix with the rolled pastry and crimp round the edge with a fork

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up and golden – this is your umami portobello & chestnut mushroom pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the carrot is tender, flatten out the parcel[s] and top with the spinach and a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the tray to the oven for a final 2 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, remove the tray from the oven and give everything a good mix up – this is your buttered veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the umami portobello & chestnut mushroom pie with the buttered veg to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
