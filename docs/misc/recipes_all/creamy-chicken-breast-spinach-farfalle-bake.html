<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion is caramelised

Once cooked, remove from the heat set aside – this is your cooked chicken breast and caramelised onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a large pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once cooked, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pot to a medium heat and add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the pot from the heat and add your soft cheese, chicken stock mix, grated cheese and most of your dried basil (you'll use the rest later) and give everything a good mix up

Add a large splash of starchy pasta water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your creamy pasta sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked chicken, cooked farfalle, most of the caramelised onion and spinach to the sauce and mix it all together

Transfer to an oven-proof dish and top with the remaining caramelised onion, panko breadcrumbs, the remaining dried basil and a drizzle of olive oil

Cook for 12-14 min or until the breadcrumbs are lightly golden – this is your creamy chicken breast & spinach farfalle bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the creamy chicken breast & spinach farfalle bake to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
