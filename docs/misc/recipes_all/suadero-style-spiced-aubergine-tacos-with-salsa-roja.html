<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot, peeled garlic and half the diced tomato (you'll use the rest later!) to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and sugar

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until everything has softened and slightly charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Remove the stalk from your dried ancho chilli[es] and discard

Add the dried ancho chilli[es] to a bowl

Cover with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and set aside for 5 min to soften

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until slightly softened and charred

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is slightly softened, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your ground paprika and ground cumin and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 130ml <span class="text-purple">[170ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [220ml] </span>boiled water and your vegetable stock mix and cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until the stock has completely absorbed – this is your suadero-style spiced aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the tray from the oven and add the softened tomato, garlic and shallot to a food processor with the softened ancho chilli and the juice from your lime[s]

Discard the baking paper and reserve the tray

Add a drizzle of olive oil and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and blitz until smooth – this is your salsa roja

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to the reserved baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through

While the tortillas are in the oven, crumble your feta roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the shredded lettuce, salsa roja and remaining diced tomato evenly between the tortillas and top with the suadero-style spiced aubergine and crumbled feta

Tear over your coriander and garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
