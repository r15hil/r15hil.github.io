<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pak choi leaves, spring onion thirds and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until both have softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and your toasted sesame oil and cook for 1 min further – this is your sesame pak choi & spring onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After 3-4 min turn the basa fillet[s] and add the sticky sauce to the pan

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the basa is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a sticky consistency – this is your sticky Chinese-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky Chinese-style basa over the sesame rice and drizzle with any remaining sticky sauce

Serve the sesame pak choi & spring onions to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
