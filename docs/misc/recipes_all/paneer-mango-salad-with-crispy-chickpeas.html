<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Slice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped paneer, onion petals and a pinch of salt, and cook for 5-6 min until the paneer is golden, turning occasionally for even colouring</p><br><br>
