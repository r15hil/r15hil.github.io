<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your ground cumin (you'll use the rest later!) with your ground coriander and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and stir to coat the grains in the spices

Add 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your spicy rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop each hake fillet into 4 pieces

Add a handful of flour to a plate with your ground smoked paprika, remaining ground cumin and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced flour

Coat the chopped hake in the spiced flour – this is your coated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Once done, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter, a pinch of salt, the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the chopped mint and white wine vinegar

Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your fragrant peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed, then fill each tortilla with some spicy rice, fragrant peas and crispy hake

To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a burrito – these are your Portuguese-style hake burritos with spicy rice & peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wrap the burritos in tin foil to hold everything together, then slice in half and serve

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
