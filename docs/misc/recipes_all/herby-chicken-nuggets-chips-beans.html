<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Coat the chicken pieces in the flour, tap off any excess, then coat them in the mayonnaise and finally press them firmly into the breadcrumbs until evenly coated - these are your herby chicken nuggets

Lightly grease a baking tray with vegetable oil

Add the herby chicken nuggets to the baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden</p><br><br>

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

Once the onions have softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the vegetable stock, Henderson's Relish, tomato frito and cannellini beans with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 5-8 min or until reduced to a baked bean-like consistency</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
