<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt, then put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 10-15 min or until they have softened

Tip: You don't want the potatoes to brown at this point!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

While the potatoes are cooking, trim your green beans, then add them to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once tender, drain and rinse the beans under cold water and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix and your redcurrant jelly in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and set it aside for later – this is your redcurrant stock

Warm 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>milk in the microwave and stir through your clotted cream – this is your clotted cream mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have softened, layer the sliced potatoes and onion in an oven-proof dish and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then pour your clotted cream mixture all over and sprinkle with your grated Italian hard cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until golden and crisp – these are your dauphinoise potatoes

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat your sirloin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once the pan is very hot, add the seasoned sirloin steak[s] to the pan, for rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side: for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side: for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the steak is cooking, return the pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min further – these are your garlicky green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the steak is resting, return the pan to a medium-high heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs until you're left with a sandy-paste

Add the redcurrant stock and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has reduced to a gravy-like consistency

Add a knob of butter and give everything a good mix up – this is your redcurrant sauce

Tip: Butter helps to thicken the sauce and give it a great shine!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested sirloin steak finely on a clean board

Served the sliced sirloin steak with the dauphinoise potatoes and garlicky green beans to the side

Pour the redcurrant sauce all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
