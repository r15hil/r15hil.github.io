<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the five-spice, 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a small bowl – this is your five-spice mix

Rub the five-spice mix deep into the criss-cross pattern

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once very hot, add the pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 3-5 min or until nicely coloured, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned pork belly, fat-side up, to a deep baking tray (lay it on tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water to the tray

Put it in the oven for 40-45 min, or until it's crisp on the outside and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Gently add the eggs to a large pot of boiled water over a high heat

Once boiling, boil for exactly 7 min, for perfect, mid-boiled eggs

Meanwhile, fill a bowl of cold water with ice (Gousto's ice packs are perfect!)

Once the eggs are done, drain and add them to your ice water and set them aside until step 7 (save the pot for later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the eggs are cooling, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then finely slice the spring onions

Top, tail and peel the carrots, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Re-boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pork belly is cooked, transfer to a chopping board and leave to rest for 5-10 min

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min

Add the miso paste, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water – this is your broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add any resting juices from the baking tray to the broth, then add the wholewheat noodles and cook for 5-7 min or until tender

While the noodles are cooking, peel and cut the cooled eggs in half

Once rested, slice the pork belly as thinly as you can using a sharp knife</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the carrot ribbons, wholewheat noodles and broth between deep bowls

Top with the sliced pork belly, spring onion, eggs and garnish with the sesame seeds – this is your crispy pork belly & noodle ramen

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
