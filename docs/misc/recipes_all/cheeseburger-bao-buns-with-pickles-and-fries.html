<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>To build, load each bao bun with a little shredded lettuce, a tomato round, shallot rings and some of the quick-pickles

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheeseburger bao buns with the fries and any remaining shredded lettuce, quick-pickles and burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
