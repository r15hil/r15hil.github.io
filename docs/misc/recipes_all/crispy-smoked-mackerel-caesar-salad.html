<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the coated mackerel and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp


Tip: Don't turn the mackerel too often, as this will stop it from crisping!


Once done, transfer the crispy mackerel to kitchen paper and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the little gem leaves in bowls topped with the dressed lettuce, golden croutons and remaining grated cheese


Top with the crispy mackerel and drizzle the remaining dressing all over


Season with a good grind of black pepper


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
