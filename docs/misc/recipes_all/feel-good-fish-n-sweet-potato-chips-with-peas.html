<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives with your panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt in a small bowl

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and stir it together until all of the breadcrumbs are coated in the oil – this is your chive crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basa fillet[s] to a separate baking tray (or two!) and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Top the fish evenly with the chive crumb and press it into the fish using the back of a spoon

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your breaded fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
