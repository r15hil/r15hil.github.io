<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly tear half your basil, including the stalks (you’ll use the rest later!)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the torn basil and a large pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and bash for 1-2 min or until it looks like a purée (or pulse in a food processor)

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> olive oil with your<span class="text-danger"> </span>Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar, a generous crack of black pepper and the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s]

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pasta has been cooking for 7 min, add the chopped asparagus to the pot and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the pasta is cooked with a slight bite and the asparagus is tender

Once done, drain and run both under cold water until slightly cooled

Tip: If you prefer your salad warm, don't run the pasta and asparagus under cold water!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel most of your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Chop the remaining basil finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the conchiglie & asparagus and top with the salad and roasted heritage tomatoes, then drizzle over the basil & lime dressing

Season with a grind of black pepper and sprinkle over the Italian hard cheese shavings and grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the chopped basil and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
