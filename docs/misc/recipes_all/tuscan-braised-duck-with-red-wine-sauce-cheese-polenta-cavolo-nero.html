<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven and prepare your duck legs


Set the oven to 160&deg;C/ 140&deg;C (fan)/ 325&deg;F/ Gas 3 and boil a kettle.


Season the duck&nbsp;all over with a pinch of salt,&nbsp;then add to a cold, dry, wide-based <span class="text-highlight">oven-proof casserole dish</span> with a matching lid. (Or use a frying pan and an oven-proof dish lined with tin foil). Cook for 6-7 minutes on medium-high or until browned all over and the fat has rendered.


Tip: brown the skin and render the fat to add flavour.


Once browned, transfer the duck legs&nbsp;to a plate and reserve the dish for later.

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Prepare the vegetables and stock 


Peel and finely dice the brown&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skins on). Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic.&nbsp;


Strip the rosemary leaves&nbsp;from the stems and chop finely. Discard the stems.


Dissolve the beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;and Just Add Wine sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled&nbsp;water.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cook the vegetables for the base


Discard some of the oil from the oven-proof dish so you're left with just 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span>.&nbsp;Return&nbsp;the dish to a medium heat.


Once hot,&nbsp;add the diced onion, carrot, garlic and rosemary with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 minutes or until starting to soften.


Once softened, add the tomato paste,&nbsp;chopped tomatoes, beef stock and a pinch of sugar and cook for 3-4 minutes.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the duck legs and pop in the oven


Sit the browned duck legs, skin side&nbsp;up, over the&nbsp;sauce and cover with the lid.&nbsp;


Put the dish in the oven&nbsp;for an initial 1 hour 20 minutes or until the duck is tender and cooked through, and the sauce is thick and rich.


Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Prepare the cavolo&nbsp;nero and garnishes


After 1 hour, chop the cavolo nero roughly, including the stalks.


Grate the Italian hard cheese.


Add the pine nuts to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 minutes or until golden. Once golden, remove from the oven and set aside until serving.


Re-boil a kettle.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Crispen your duck and cook the polenta


Once the duck is tender, increase the temperature to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7, remove the lid from the dish and cook for 10 minutes further or until the skin is crispy.


Add 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water to a pot and bring to the boil over a high heat. Be sure to add 1/2 tsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt!


Once boiling,&nbsp;gradually&nbsp;whisk the&nbsp;polenta&nbsp;into the&nbsp;water in a steady stream, whisking&nbsp;continuously to stop lumps from forming.&nbsp;&nbsp;


Reduce the heat to medium and continue to whisk the polenta&nbsp;for 2-3 minutes or until thickened&nbsp;to a mashed potato-like consistency.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add cheese and seasoning to the polenta 


Once thickened, add the grated cheese&nbsp;with a large knob of butter and whisk to combine. Taste the polenta and&nbsp;add another pinch of&nbsp;salt and pepper&nbsp;if needed. This is your cheese polenta.


Re-boil a kettle.


Add the chopped cavolo nero to a colander over the sink and pour over all of the <span class="text-highlight">boiled water</span> until bright green and wilted.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Serve the rich sauce&nbsp;over the cheese polenta with the&nbsp;duck leg on top and&nbsp;cavolo nero to the side.


Garnish with the toasted pine nuts.


Enjoy!
