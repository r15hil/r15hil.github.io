<h4>Step 1</h4>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Chop your chicken breast strips into smaller strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and set aside</p><br><br>

Cook for 1-2 min further, stirring until the sauce sticks to the noodles – this is your simply delicious chicken stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
