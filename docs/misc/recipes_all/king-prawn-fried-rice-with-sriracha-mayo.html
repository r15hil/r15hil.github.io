<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, peel and and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>
