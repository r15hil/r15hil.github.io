<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, creamed coconut and red Thai curry paste in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red Thai-style stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for an initial 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

After the initial 15-20 min, remove the lid and add the chopped spring onion

Cook for a further 3-4 min, or until the sauce has started to thicken – this is your red Thai-style chicken & sweet potato curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the red Thai-style chicken & sweet potato curry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
