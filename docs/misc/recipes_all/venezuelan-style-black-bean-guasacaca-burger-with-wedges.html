<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and cut the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into quarters

Slice 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> of the onion finely and set aside, then grate the remaining onion roughly

Drain and rinse the black beans

Add the drained black beans to a bowl with the grated onion, ground cumin, Henderson’s Relish, soy sauce and panko breadcrumbs

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!), then shape into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>patties – these are your black bean patties

Reserve the bowl

Add the black bean patties to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with a small drizzle of olive oil and cook for an initial 10-12 min or until beginning to crisp on the outside

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the brioche buns in half

Slice the cheddar cheese thinly

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After the initial 10-12 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with the black bean burgers from the oven and top them with the sliced cheese

Add the sliced brioche buns, cut side up, to the other side of the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the buns are warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop the zested lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the smashed avocado to the reserved bowl with most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!), the lime zest and the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lime wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Season with a pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your guasacaca-style sauce

Combine the mayo with a small squeeze of lime juice in a bowl – this is your lime mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, top a warmed brioche base with a cheesy black bean patty, the guasacaca-style sauce, sliced onion and a warmed brioche lid – this is your Venezuelan-style black bean & guasacaca burger

Serve the burger with the wedges and lime mayo to the side

Garnish with the chopped tomato topped with the remaining coriander and remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
