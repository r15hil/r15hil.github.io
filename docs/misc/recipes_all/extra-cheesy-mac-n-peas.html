<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked macaroni</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese finely

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Melt 15g <span class="text-purple">[22g]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[30g] </span>butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 15g<span class="text-purple"> [22g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Gradually whisk the creamy stock into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-6 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once you have a thick sauce, stir through your Dijon mustard and half the grated cheddar (you'll use the rest later!) then season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel your garlic and add it to a food processor with your basil, grated Italian hard cheese, 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>cold water, blanched peas and the juice of half your lemon[s]

Blitz until well combined and semi-smooth – this is your pea pesto

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs and the remaining grated cheddar to a small bowl with a grind of pepper – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs

Add the drained macaroni to the béchamel sauce – this is your pasta mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the pasta mixture to an oven-proof dish

Mix through the pea pesto then top with the cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until it's golden – this is your mac 'n' peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your zingy salad

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your mac 'n' peas with the zingy salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
