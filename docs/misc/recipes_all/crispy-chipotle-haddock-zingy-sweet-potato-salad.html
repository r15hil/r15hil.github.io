<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, your ground smoked paprika, and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the sweet potato is cooked through and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Add the haddock bites to a bowl with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give them a good mix until the fish is nicely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded haddock with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – this is your crispy chipotle haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!), the juice of half the lime[s], a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your lime mayo

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy chipotle haddock with the zingy sweet potato salad to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
