<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Cut your lemon[s] into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with your ground turmeric, ground paprika, garam masala, ginger paste and a squeeze of lemon juice

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tikka marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Meanwhile, drain your king prawns, then add them to the tikka marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the marinated king prawns to the pan and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally until golden and cooked through – this is your king prawn tikka

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then dice roughly

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the diced cucumber and grated carrot to a bowl with your nigella seeds, a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Indian-style salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining natural yoghurt with your mint sauce in a small bowl – this is your mint yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warmed naan[s] topped with the king prawn tikka and Indian-style salad

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt and garnish with the remaining lemon quarters

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
