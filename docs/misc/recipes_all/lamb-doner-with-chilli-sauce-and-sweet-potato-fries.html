<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and grate half your red onion

Peel and finely slice the remaining onion and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your lamb mince to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, ground cumin, dried oregano and grated onion

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut 2 A3 size sheets of non-stick baking paper

Put the lamb mixture between the two sheets and using a rolling pin, roll it out until approx. the thickness of a pound coin

Peel off the top baking sheet[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and transfer the rolled lamb to a large baking tray (or two!)

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

Add the tray[s] to the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the lamb is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

Slice your tomato[es] into wedges

Combine the remaining chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) in a bowl with your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your tomato ketchup to a separate bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Give it a good mix up – this is your chilli sauce

Once the sweet potato fries are almost done, add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lamb is cooked, remove from the oven and pat dry with kitchen paper

Transfer the cooked lamb to a clean board and slice into long strips – this is your lamb doner meat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the warmed pitta with the shredded lettuce, lamb doner meat, onion slices and tomato wedges

Drizzle over some of the garlic mayo and chilli sauce and serve the sweet potato fries and remaining garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
