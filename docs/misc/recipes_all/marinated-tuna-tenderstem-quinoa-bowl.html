<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6 and boil a kettle

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the eggs<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the eggs from cracking) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked eggs to the bowl

Set aside to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the eggs are boiling, add the cherry tomatoes and Tenderstem broccoli to baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until the Tenderstem is lightly charred and the tomatoes have blistered slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the vegetables are in the oven, drain the tuna

Combine the drained tuna and oregano with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your marinated tuna</p><br><br>
