<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add your hot dog sausage[s] to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the sausage is cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sausages are cooking, slice your shallot[s] as thinly as you can

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 7 min or until it's cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the macaroni, reserving the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs, chopped garlic and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently – this is your garlic breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk into the roux with your soft cheese and whisk for 3-4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked macaroni and grated cheese to the pot with a generous grind of pepper and a small pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up until fully coated and the cheese has melted – this is your macaroni cheese

Once the sausages have had 25 min, add your hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the baking tray[s] and cook for 3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce, tomato wedges and quick-pickled shallot to a bowl with a small drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato & shallot salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s]

Fill each hot dog bun with a hot dog sausage, then top with some of the macaroni cheese, your BBQ sauce and some of the garlic breadcrumbs

Serve the remaining macaroni cheese topped with the remaining garlic breadcrumbs and the tomato & shallot salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
