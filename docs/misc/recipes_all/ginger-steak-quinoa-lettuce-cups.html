<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a lid with 180ml <span class="text-danger">[360ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked transfer them to a chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest until later</p><br><br>

Slice the radishes as finely as you can

Separate 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> outer gem lettuce leaves, wash and pat dry with kitchen paper, then shred the inner cores finely</p><br><br>
