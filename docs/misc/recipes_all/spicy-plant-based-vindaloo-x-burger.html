<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your turmeric fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Combine half your white wine vinegar and half the sliced red onion (save the rest for later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl – this is your quick-pickled onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once softened, add a generous knob of butter alternative and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot with your smoked paprika and half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your tomato paste, the remaining white wine vinegar and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a final 4-5 min or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your vindaloo-style chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with baking paper

Add your ultimate vegan burger patty[ies] to one side of the tray and coat with a little vegetable oil and the remaining curry powder

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through – these are your spiced plant-based burger patty[ies]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the quick-pickled onion from the bowl and set aside until serving, reserve the bowl with the pickling liquid

Add your vegan mayo, a drizzle of vegetable oil and the remaining turmeric to the pickling liquid and mix everything together – this is your turmeric mayo

Once the burger patties have had 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and slice your plant-based brioche bun[s] in half, then add them to the baking tray and return them to the oven for 2-3 min or until toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the turmeric fries are golden and crisp, remove the tray from the oven and add the spinach and nigella seeds

Return the tray to the oven for a final 1-2 min or until the spinach is slightly softened

Once softened, give them a good mix up – these are your saag fries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the toasted brioche base with the vindaloo-style chutney, then add the spiced plant-based burger patty, a handful of quick-pickled onion, a drizzle of turmeric mayo and a toasted brioche lid – this is your spicy plant-based vindaloo x burger

Serve the saag fries to the side, topped with the remaining quick-pickled onion and turmeric mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
