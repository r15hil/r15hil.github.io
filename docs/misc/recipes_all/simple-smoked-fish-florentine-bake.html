<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Dissolve your soft cheese and vegetable stock mix in 70ml [<span class="text-purple">90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> boiled water

Once dissolved, add your wholegrain mustard, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and a generous grind of pepper – this is your creamy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and crush them lightly with a fork

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the smoked basa mixture with the crushed potatoes, spreading them out evenly

Put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until the potatoes are crispy and browned – this is your smoked basa florentine bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the smoked basa florentine bake to cool for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
