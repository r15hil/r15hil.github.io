<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add turkey mince and cook for 2 min, breaking up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>

Tear the basil leaves over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
