<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, diced carrot, chopped tomatoes, sliced pepper and garlic with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 10-12 min, or until the onion has started to soften

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, combine your vegetable stock mix and half your ground turmeric (save the rest for later!) with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your turmeric stock

Once the vegetables have softened, add your tomato paste and cook for 1 min, stirring continuously

Add the turmeric stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-6 min or or until it's reduced to a bolognese-like consistency

Tip: If you like it more saucy add a splash more water!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Stir most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) through the cooked stew – this is your Mediterranean stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through, then spread with a knob of butter

Cut each buttered half into triangles – this is your buttery ciabatta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mediterranean stew topped with the sea bass with the buttery ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and a drizzle of the sunny aioli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
