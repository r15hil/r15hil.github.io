<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add your lean pork mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up roughly with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork is browning, cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pork mince has browned, add your smoked paprika, ground cumin and dried oregano to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> flour

Add your tomato paste and diced potatoes with a generous pinch of salt

Mix everything together until fully coated in spices and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your beef stock mix, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water

Stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)– this is your chipotle lean pork stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your sweetcorn (no need to drain) to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until charred – this is your baked corn

While the corn is in the oven, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chipotle lean pork stew has had an initial 15 min, add the chopped pepper and cook, covered, for a final 6-7 min or until the pepper is tender with a bite and the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency

Remove the baked corn from the oven and stir half through the chipotle pork stew (save the rest for garnish) – this is your chipotle lean pork & corn stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chipotle lean pork & corn stew and top with a dollop of sour cream

Sprinkle over the remaining baked corn

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
