<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the grated carrot to a small bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix it all together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled carrot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to caramelise

Tip: Try not to stir the mushrooms too often, as this will stop them from caramelising!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until cooked to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then add it to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and a pinch of salt – this is your sesame spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have caramelised, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your ginger paste, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar, then cook for 30 secs further or until fragrant and slightly thickened – these are your ginger mushrooms

Combine your sriracha, gochujang (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your mirin in a bowl – this is your fiery sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked rice, ginger mushrooms, quick-pickled carrot and sesame spinach in a bowl and top with a fried egg – this is your crispy mushroom bibimbap

Drizzle the fiery sauce over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
