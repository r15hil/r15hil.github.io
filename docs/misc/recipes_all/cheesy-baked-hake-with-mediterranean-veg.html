<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add to a tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are in the oven, boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your red onion[s] roughly

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add them to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb mix over the fish until totally covered

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min, or until the breadcrumb mixture is starting to turn golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your cheesy baked hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the hake is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette<span class="text-danger"> </span>and tomato paste to the pan<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened</p><br><br>
