<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

Once the rice has had 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, combine your tomato ketchup and soy sauce in a bowl with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your soy ketchup

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whisk your egg[s] and a splash of milk in a jug with a pinch of pepper – this is your omelette mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, drain then add your king prawns, sliced garlic and shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your garlic & shichimi togarashi king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked through, transfer the garlic & shichimi togarashi king prawns (reserve the pan!) to the pot with the rice

Add your vegetable stock mix and blanched peas and give everything a good mix up

Cover and set aside – this is your king prawn rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, pour enough of the omelette mix into the pan in a rough circle to make 1 omelette blanket per person

Cook for 20 secs or until the omelette mix is cooked all the way through, then transfer to a small plate – this is your omelette blanket</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Press the king prawn rice into a bowl and turn out

Top with an omelette blanket and drizzle over the soy ketchup

Sprinkle over your crispy onions – this is your Japanese-style omurice with garlic & shichimi togarashi king prawns

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
