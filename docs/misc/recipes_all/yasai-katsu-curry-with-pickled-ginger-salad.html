<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs, then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

Remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and slice into rounds

Combine your cornflour and vegetable stock mix in a bowl with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your cornflour mixture

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and mix it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Coat the aubergine rounds in the cornflour mixture, then press into the seasoned panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Add the coated aubergine rounds to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) and drizzle very generously with vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until crisp, golden and cooked through – this is your yasai katsu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the aubergine is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) half your ginger into lengths

Finely chop (or grate) the remaining ginger

Add the peeled ginger to a small bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside for later – this is your soaked ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s] then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a separate pot with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, ground turmeric and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [510ml] </span>boiled water, chopped creamed coconut, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and soy sauce to the pot

Cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency, then blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the soaked ginger, then add it to a large bowl with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add to the bowl and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your quick-pickled ginger salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Return the curry sauce to a medium heat to reheat

Top the cooked rice with the yasai katsu then spoon over the curry sauce

Serve the quick-pickled ginger salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
