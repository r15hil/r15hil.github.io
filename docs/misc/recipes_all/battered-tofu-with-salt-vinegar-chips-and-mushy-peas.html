<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into chunky chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil to a deep baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 5 min or until the oil is hot

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Combine the chopped shallot with your mayo, the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt in a  bowl, then give everything a good stir – this is your lemon mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once done, drain the softened chunky chips and reserve the pot, give them a shake in the colander until the edges have fluffed up a little

Carefully remove the tray[s] of hot vegetable oil from the oven and add the fluffed chunky chips (do this slowly!)

Season them with salt and turn them a few times until they're fully coated in the oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your Marmite and 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> very cold water in a bowl, stirring continuously until fully combined – this is your Marmite water

Add 60g <span class="text-purple">[90g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour to a separate large bowl with half of your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), a generous pinch of salt and the Marmite water

Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no lumps, then set aside for later – this is your batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu, and cut the block into 2 pieces per person

Pat the tofu pieces dry with kitchen paper

Season the tofu pieces with a pinch of salt and sprinkle both sides with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, dip the seasoned tofu into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated

Add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side until golden and crispy – this is your battered tofu

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person and set aside for garnish

Add your blanched peas to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter

Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your mushy peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the battered tofu with the chunky chips and mushy peas to the side

Sprinkle the chips with the remaining red wine vinegar – these are your salt & vinegar chips

Serve with your ketchup and lemon mayo to the side for dipping, and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
