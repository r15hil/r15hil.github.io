<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your broccoli into small florets

Cut piece[s] of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the broccoli to form sealed parcel[s] for per person

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cornflour (save the rest for later!), your soy sauce and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> water in a bowl and stir it all together

Add your Chinese rice wine and honey and give everything a good mix up – this is your honey sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces and add them to a bowl

Add the remaining cornflour and give everything a good mix up until the basa is fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4<span class="text-danger"> </span>min on each side or until golden – this is your golden basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the basa is golden, transfer it to a plate and set aside for later

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Carefully pour away most of the oil and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the honey sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thick and sticky

Once the sauce has thickened, return the golden basa to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the basa is fully coated – this is your General Tso's basa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the General Tso's basa over the cooked rice with the broccoli to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
