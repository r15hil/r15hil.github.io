<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced tomato paste to the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water and season with a generous pinch of salt

Cover with a lid and cook for an initial 7-10 min or until the sauce has reduced slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your hake fillets into bite-sized pieces

Sprinkle your ground cumin, ground coriander and a large pinch of salt over the chopped hake and gently rub the spices all over the fish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has reduced, add the chopped hake to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your chipotle spiced hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the hake is cooking, cut your lime[s] into quarters

Combine your mayo with a squeeze of lime juice and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the shredded lettuce, sliced spring onion, chipotle spiced hake, grated cheese and lime mayo evenly between the warmed tortillas

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
