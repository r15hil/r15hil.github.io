<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min] </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Cut the lemongrass in half and the tomatoes into wedges, then add these to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

Cut the ginger in half (no need to peel!)

Add the crushed garlic and halved ginger to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add the chopped creamed coconut and 500ml<span class="text-danger"> [1L] </span>boiled water to the dish and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Add the haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and return the dish to the oven for 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through – this is your all-in-one fragrant coconutty haddock curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, tear the coriander over the all-in-one fragrant coconutty haddock curry

Garnish with a lime wedge

Tip: Watch out for the ginger halves and lemongrass, discard them!

Let everyone dig in!</p><br><br>
