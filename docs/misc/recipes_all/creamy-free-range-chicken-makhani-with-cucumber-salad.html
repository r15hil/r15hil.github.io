<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Add your cashew nuts to a bowl, cover with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, then cover with a plate and set aside

Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Go easy!), garam masala, ground turmeric, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Transfer the marinated chicken to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 6-8 min or until the chicken is slightly charred

Once done, set aside – this is your chicken tikka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add most of the chopped onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and tomato paste to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant, then once fragrant, add the softened cashews and a splash of the soaking liquid (reserve the rest for later!) to a food processor and blitz until a paste forms – this is your creamy cashew paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the creamy cashew paste and remaining soaking liquid to the pan with your chicken stock mix and the chicken tikka (and any juices from the tray)

Turn the heat up to high and cook for 7-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your creamy free range chicken makhani</p><br><br>

<p>Add the diced cucumber and the remaining chopped onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy free range chicken makhani over the cooked rice with cucumber salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
