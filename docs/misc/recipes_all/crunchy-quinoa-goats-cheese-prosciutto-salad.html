<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with baking paper

Add the sweet potato rounds and onion wedges to the baking tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until everything's slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a crack of black pepper and a pinch of sugar – this is your sun-dried tomato & balsamic dressing

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Once the quinoa is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and stir through the remaining sun-dried tomato paste and chopped garlic – this is your sun-dried tomato & balsamic quinoa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato and onion have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push the veg to one side

Add the sun-dried tomato & balsamic quinoa to the other side and spread it out evenly

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min or until the veg is completely tender and the quinoa is crunchy – this is your roasted veg & crunchy quinoa</p><br><br>

<p>While everything's in the oven, tear your sliced prosciutto into strips

Crumble your goats' cheese into bite-size pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the shredded lettuce in a bowl topped with the roasted veg & crunchy quinoa

Sprinkle over the crumbled goats' cheese and prosciutto strips and tear over your basil

Drizzle over the balsamic & sun-dried tomato dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
