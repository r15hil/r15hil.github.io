<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts, panko breadcrumbs and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the breadcrumbs are browning, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of sugar, then stir in your creamy single soy– this is your creamy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the breadcrumbs are golden, transfer them to a bowl with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!)

Give everything a good mix up and set aside until serving, reserve the pan – this is your garlic & parsley crumb

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes, remaining garlic and a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the creamy stock and cooked spaghetti to the softened tomatoes and cook for 2-3 min, or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the remaining parsley and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce –this is your creamy tomato spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato spaghetti topped with the garlic & parsley crumb – this is your creamy tomato & garlic bread-style spaghetti

Serve the salad to the side with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
