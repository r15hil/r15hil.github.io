<p><strong>Description:</strong> Gammon is essentially uncooked ham. It's taken from the hind of pork leg and is salt-cured in the same way as bacon. Usually the preserve of Christmas, we thought we'd break the rules and enjoy ours midweek with a honey-mustard glaze.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the honey with half of the&nbsp;mustard, reserving&nbsp;the remaining mustard for step 5

Serve the roasted potatoes, cranberry salad and wholegrain mustard mayo&nbsp;to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
