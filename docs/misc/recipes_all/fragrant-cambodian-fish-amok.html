<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then into batons

Add the cucumber batons to a small bowl with your rice vinegar – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Slice half of your red chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish

Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers (save them for later!) and chop the soft inner core[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, outer lemongrass layers and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving - this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until softened

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and add your fish sauce – this is your coconut stock

Once the shallot has softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped lemongrass, your cornflour, your ground turmeric and the finely chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface and cut in half

Add the coconut stock with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and the juice of half the lime

Cook for 3-5 min or until thickened to a curry sauce-like consistency

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once thickened, sit the chopped basa on top of the sauce and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Once the fish is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and gently stir through the chopped basil – this is your Cambodian-style fish amok</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the outer lemongrass layers from the lemongrass rice and discard, then fluff with a fork

Serve the Cambodian-style fish amok over the lemongrass rice with a lime wedge and the quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
