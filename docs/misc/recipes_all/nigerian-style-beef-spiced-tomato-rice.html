<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Once hot, add the diced beef to the dish with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the beef is browning, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Chop half your pepper[s] into bite-sized chunks

Chop half your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover the dish with a lid and put in the oven for 1 hour or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through – this is your Nigerian-style beef & pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beef has had 40 min, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and diced tomato

Cook for 5-6 min or until softening, then add your ground turmeric, a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for a final 3-4 min – this is your turmeric pepper chutney</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced Nigerian-style beef & pepper with your cooked rice to the side

Top with the turmeric pepper chutney

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
