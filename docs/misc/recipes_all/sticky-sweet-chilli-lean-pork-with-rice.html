<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
