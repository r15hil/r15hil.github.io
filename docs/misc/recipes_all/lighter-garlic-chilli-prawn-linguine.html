<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water, then set it aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim the end[s] from your courgette[s] keeping the stalk[s] intact

Without cutting through the stalk[s], carefully slice the trimmed courgette[s] into thin strips, lengthways (at approx. 5mm intervals)

Then peel the lengths of the sliced courgette[s] until you have a pile of 'courgetti'

Tip: Have a spiraliser? Use this instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened and starting to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the tomatoes have softened, add the sliced garlic and cook for 2-3 min until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Increase the heat to medium-high heat, then drain and add your king prawns and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the prawns are cooked, add the spinach, drained linguine and courgetti to the pan and cook until the spinach has wilted

Remove from the heat and squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix – this is your lighter king prawn, garlic & chilli linguine with spinach

Tip: If it’s looking a little dry add a splash of the starchy pasta water

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lighter king prawn, garlic & chilli linguine with spinach with a lemon wedge to the side

Finish with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
