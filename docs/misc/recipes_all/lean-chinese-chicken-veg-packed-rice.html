<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once the brown rice is cooked, drain and keep it in the sieve, reserving the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken pieces and cook for 2-3 min on each side, or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine the hoisin sauce, cornflour, soy sauce and rice vinegar with 75ml <span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> water – this is your hoisin sauce

Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the hoisin sauce

Cook, covered, for a further 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened - this is your Chinese chicken</p><br><br>

Chop any larger leaves in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the shredded kale and pak choi with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to wilt

Add the chopped ginger, garlic and cooked brown rice and cook for a further 1-2 min or until everything is well combined - this is your veg-packed rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

Slice the Chinese chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced Chinese chicken over the veg-packed rice

Drizzle over any remaining hoisin sauce and garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy</p><br><br>
