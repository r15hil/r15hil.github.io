<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt, then drizzle over your red wine vinegar and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min – these are your salt & vinegar chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and stir through your Dijon mustard – this is your mustard stock

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped garlic and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the mustard stock with your soft cheese and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>milk and cook for 5-8 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from heat and stir through the chopped chives and chopped basa

Season with a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy fish pie mix

Transfer the creamy fish pie mix to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top the fish pie mix with the salt & vinegar chips

Tip: Try to put the crispiest chips at the bottom and balance the rest over the top so that they don’t sink!

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are crispy and the fish is cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pie is almost done, reboil half a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2-3 min or until tender

Once tender, drain the peas and return them to the pot with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy fish & chip pie with the peas to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
