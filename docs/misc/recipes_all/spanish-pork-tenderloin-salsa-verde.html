<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a simple low-calorie Spanish roast. You'll rub pork tenderloin with dried oregano and pan-fry it gently. Instead of gravy, you'll make a salsa verde (green sauce) from fresh parsley, shallot, garlic and olive oil. Served with a sweet and sour stuffed pepper and smoky sweet potato cubes. </p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pork has browned, reduce the heat to medium, add a splash of water, cover with a lid and cook for 8-10 min, turning once half way through


Once cooked, transfer the&nbsp;cooked pork to a chopping board, cover with a tea towel and set aside to rest for 3 min


Tip: resting the meat helps it to relax and keeps it juicy!

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced pork over the salsa verde&nbsp;with the smoky&nbsp;sweet potatoes and sweet and sour roasted pepper to the side&nbsp;
