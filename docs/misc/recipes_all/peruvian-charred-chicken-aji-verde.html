<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine your ground cumin, soy sauce, honey and Dijon mustard with the juice of half your lime[s] and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil in a large bowl

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and add them to the bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Turn the chicken thighs several times until fully coated in the marinade

Add the coated chicken thighs and any remaining marinade to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until dark brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Peruvian-style charred chicken</p><br><br>

Add the chunky chips to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Tear in your coriander leaves, discard the stalks

Add your mayo and juice of the remaining lime

Season with a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your aji verde</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the grated carrot, sliced tomato and sliced spring onion to a bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Stir it all together – this is your carrot salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
