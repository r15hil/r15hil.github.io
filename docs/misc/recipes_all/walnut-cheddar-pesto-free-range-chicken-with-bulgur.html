<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your walnuts and toast for 3-4 min, or until they've darkened in colour slightly

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the walnuts are toasting, chop your basil coarsely (including the stalks)

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Crumble your cheddar cheese into small pieces

Transfer the toasted walnuts to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop the walnuts with a knife, then add to a pestle & mortar!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped basil, chopped garlic and crumbled cheddar to the food processor (or a pestle & mortar), along with your red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper, and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz together to form a coarse purée – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into strips

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side until golden

Tip: Grind a generous amount of pepper onto the chicken for an extra kick of spice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Once the chicken has browned, add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for a further 4 min, or until the tomatoes have warmed through and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork

Stir the fluffed bulgur and half of the walnut & cheddar pesto (reserve the rest for garnish!) through the chicken and tomatoes, until everything is lightly coated in the pan juices and pesto – this is your walnut & cheddar pesto free range chicken with bulgur

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the walnut & cheddar pesto free range chicken with bulgur over the salad

Dot the remaining walnut & cheddar pesto all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
