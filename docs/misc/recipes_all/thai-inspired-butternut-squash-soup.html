<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the garlic and peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop (or grate) the ginger

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely and separate the coriander leaves from the stems

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin, then chop in half

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, coriander stems and half the coriander leaves (save some for garnish!) to the pot and mix it all together

Add the halved lemongrass and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Combine the creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix with 500ml <span class="text-danger">[950ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pot with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime  and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the butternut squash is fork-tender

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium-high heat

Sprinkle the rotis with a little cold water

Once hot, add the rotis to the pan and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the pot from the heat and discard the cooked lemongrass

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Thai-style butternut squash soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style butternut squash soup in bowls with the warmed rotis to the side

Top the soup with the peanuts, remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining coriander leaves

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
