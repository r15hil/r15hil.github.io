<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the mackerel is warming, add the juice of the remaining lemon to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressing

Add the shredded lettuce, half the sliced cucumber (save the rest for later!) and chopped tomato to the bowl and toss until fully coated – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread the roasted garlic mayo on each toasted bread roll half

Top with the cooked potato discs, a lettuce leaf, the remaining sliced cucumber, buttery chive mackerel and your crispy onions

Serve the dressed salad to one side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
