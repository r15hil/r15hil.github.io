<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a large oven-proof dish (or two!)

Add your diced chicken breast to one side of the dish[es]

Coat your gnocchi in a little olive oil and add it to the other side of the dish[es]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Put the dish[es] in the oven for an initial 30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the gnocchi is crispy and golden

Tip: Check your gnocchi after 25 min and give it a stir for even crispiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once everything's been cooking for 30 min, boil half a kettle

Cut your tomato[es] in half

Add the tomato halves, cut-side up, to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt

Drizzle over half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – this is your roasted balsamic tomato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi and chicken are almost done, mix your grated Italian hard cheese and cornflour in a jug

Add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and cracked black pepper – this is your cacio e pepe sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the gnocchi & chicken from the oven, pour over the cacio e pepe sauce and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish[es] to the oven for 8-10 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the cheese has melted – this is your all-in-one chicken breast & gnocchi cacio e pepe</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the all-in-one chicken breast & gnocchi cacio e pepe with the salad to the side topped with the roasted balsamic tomato

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle it over the salad
