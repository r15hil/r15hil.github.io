<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potato wedges are cooking, combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!), 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and panko breadcrumbs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together until the 'Nduja and breadcrumbs are fully incorporated

Divide the mixture evenly and shape them into 3 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the onion softens, grate your cheddar cheese

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half

Once the onion has softened, add your tomato paste, dried oregano and your balsamic vinegar with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are done, transfer them to the thickened sauce and stir together until they’re fully coated (discard the baking paper and save the tray[s]!)

Add your halved ciabatta[s], cut-side up, to the tray[s] and put them in the oven for 1-2 min or until they are starting to crisp

Tip: This will stop them from going soggy when you add the meatballs!</p><br><br>

Top the meatballs with the grated cheese and return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the cheese has melted – this is your spicy pork & 'Nduja meatball ciabatta

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
