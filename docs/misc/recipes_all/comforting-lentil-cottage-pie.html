<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, diced carrot and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your Marmite – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

Season with a grind of black pepper and a pinch of salt, then cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened – this is your lentil mixture

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>
