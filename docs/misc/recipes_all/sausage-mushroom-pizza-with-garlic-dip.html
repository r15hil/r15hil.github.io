<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Meanwhile, finely slice the baby button mushrooms

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage meat (remove the paper if required!), breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

Cook for 3 min or until the sausage meat has browned slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat has browned, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 2 min further until the mushrooms have started to caramelise (no pink meat!)– this is your sausage & mushroom mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the tomato paste to a bowl with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [10 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and add the pizza bases

Divide the tomato sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella and sausage & mushroom mixture

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 13-15 min or until the mozzarella has melted and the pizza bases are crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are cooking, combine the remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with the mayo, dried oregano, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl – this is your garlic & herb dip</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage & mushroom pizzas with the garlic & herb dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
