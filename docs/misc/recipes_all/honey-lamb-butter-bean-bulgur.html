<p><strong>Description:</strong> This super simple lamb dish is inspired by the Greek island of Paros. You'll caramelise the lamb mince, courgette and butter beans with stock and honey so that it crisps up and goes sweet and salty. Served over dill-flecked bulgur wheat, with fresh mint to garnish. Make sure you drizzle it with olive oil at the end.</p>
