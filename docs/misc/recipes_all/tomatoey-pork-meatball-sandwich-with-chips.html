<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the chips are in the oven, peel and finely chop (or grate) 2/3 of your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Peel and dice your shallot[s] finely

Grate your Italian hard cheese finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add most of it to a colander (save a handful for later!) and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with half the diced shallot, half your chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and mix until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide equally into 4 per person and shape into meatballs, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs have lightly browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside (these will finish cooking in the sauce later)

Return the pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the remaining diced shallot, chopped garlic and chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomato has slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add your tomato paste, dried oregano, remaining chicken stock mix and 190ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[320ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the browned meatballs to the pan with a pinch of sugar

Cook, covered, for an initial 9-11 min, then remove the lid and reduce the heat to medium and cook for a final 3-4 min, or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to coat the meatballs

Once everything is cooked, stir through the wilted spinach – these are your tomatoey pork meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the meatballs are almost ready, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] with the chips from the oven and move them to one side, add the ciabatta halves to the other side and return to the oven for 2-3 min or until they’re hot and crusty</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Rub the reserved garlic over the cut side of the toasted ciabatta base, then layer on the reserved spinach

Add the tomatoey pork meatballs and any remaining tomato sauce from the pan to the ciabatta base and top with the grated Italian hard cheese and the toasted ciabatta lid

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the garlic and fresh spinach leaves!</span>

Season to taste and enjoy!</p><br><br>
