<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cut 3 thin slices of lemon per person

Once boiling, add your saffron and lemon slices to the rice

Reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into rough bite-sized pieces

Garnish with any remaining lemon wedges to the side
