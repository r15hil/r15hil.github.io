<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Cut your waxy potatoes in half (skins on)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until almost fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken breast portion[s] with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your flattened chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat the flattened chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them into the beaten egg and finally press them into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5 min on each side (you may need to do this in batches!) or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken escalope

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), chopped parsley, clotted cream and a squeeze of lemon juice (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – this is your garlic butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim your green beans

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add your green beans to the pot and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once done, drain and return them to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cut your remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the crispy chicken escalope with the garlic butter – this is your garlicky free range chicken kiev

Serve the garlicky free range chicken kiev with the tender green beans and potatoes to the side, and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
