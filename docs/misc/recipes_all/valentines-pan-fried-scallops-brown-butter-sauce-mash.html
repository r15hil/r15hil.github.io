<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, add the hazelnuts to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until toasted

Once toasted, set aside to cool slightly

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks, then cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Chop the cooled hazelnuts roughly

Pat the king scallops dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the scallops and cook for 2 min on one side, or until golden brown

Flip the scallops and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your scallops are cooked when they turn opaque</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim the woody ends off the asparagus spears

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Add the trimmed asparagus spears to a separate pot of boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once done, drain and return to the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the scallops are done, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat with 40g <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> butter

Cook for 2-3 min or until the butter starts to brown

Once brown, stir through the chopped parsley, juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and capers – this is your brown butter sauce

Return the scallops to the sauce and cook for 30 secs until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the scallops over the mash with the asparagus spears to the side

Spoon over the brown butter sauce and garnish with the chopped hazelnuts and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
