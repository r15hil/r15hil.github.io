<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s] and your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably with a matching lid), with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook for 7-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes

Cut the peeled potatoes into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and chop into large chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped potatoes and leek to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix everything together</p><br><br>

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix, soft cheese, grated cheddar, 1/3 of your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and your Dijon mustard

Add your Chinese rice wine and mix it all together and cook for 6-7 min – this is your creamy leek & potato mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the pastry into triangles, roughly the size of your palm</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the cheesy leek & potato mixture to an oven-proof dish

Top the mixture with the pastry triangles, leaving some gaps in between and brush with a little milk

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your cheesy leek, potato & mustard pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your asparagus to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a large splash of cold water

Scrunch the foil around the asparagus to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

When the pie is almost ready, put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the asparagus are tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy leek, potato & mustard pie with the steamed asparagus to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
