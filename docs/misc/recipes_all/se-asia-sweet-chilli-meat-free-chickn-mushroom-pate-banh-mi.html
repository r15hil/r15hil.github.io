<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice each warmed baguette in half (without cutting all the way through) and open it out like a book

Spread over the mushroom pâté and top with the sweet chilli meat-free chick'n, carrot ribbons, cucumber slices and mint & coriander leaves – this is your sweet chilli meat-free chick'n & mushroom báhn mì
