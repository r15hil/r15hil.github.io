<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the beef strips and sprinkle over the cornflour

Cook for 1-2 min without stirring to get colour on one side of the beef

After 1-2 min, turn the beef and cook for 1-2 min further or until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned beef to a plate and set aside

Tip: Don't worry if it's not fully cooked yet, it'll go back in the sauce later!

Return the pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the ginger & garlic paste to the pan with the chopped pepper & onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the veg is softening, combine the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), honey, soy sauce, ketchup and rice vinegar in a small bowl – this is your sticky chilli sauce

Meanwhile, add the edamame & jasmine rice to a large, heatproof bowl and put the bowl in the microwave for 2-3 min or until piping hot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the veg has started to soften, return the browned beef to the pan and pour in the sticky sauce

Cook for 1-2 min further until the sauce has thickened slightly and has coated everything nicely – this is your sticky chilli beef</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky chilli beef over the edamame & jasmine rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
