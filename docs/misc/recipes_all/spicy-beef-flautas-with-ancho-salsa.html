<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until the meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy beef filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide the spicy beef filling evenly between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and add them to a baking tray (or two!), seam-side down

Drizzle with olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until beginning to crisp – these are your spicy beef flautas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and bash into a smooth paste

Stir the coriander paste through your soured cream with a squeeze of your lime[s] – this is your coriander crema

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the coriander very finely and mix with the salt and soured cream in a bowl!</p><br><br>

<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash, then chop your lettuce roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the spicy beef flautas with the chopped lettuce and chopped tomato to the side

Drizzle over the coriander crema

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
