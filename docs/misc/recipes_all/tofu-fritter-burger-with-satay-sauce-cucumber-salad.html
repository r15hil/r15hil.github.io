<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, add the peanut butter, half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!), sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>boiled water

Stir until fully combined – this is your satay sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the sliced shallot, sliced cucumber and chopped coriander to a bowl with the juice of the remaining lime and a pinch of sugar

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Grate the tofu

Add the grated tofu to a large bowl with the remaining soy sauce, tamarind paste, cornflour, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour, 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tofu fritter batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add 4 large spoonfuls of the tofu fritter batter to the pan and press them down with the back of a spoon to flatten them into patties (cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!)

Cook for 4-5 min on each side until crispy and golden – these are your tofu fritters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the ciabattas in half

Once the chips are almost done, remove them from the oven and add the sliced ciabattas to the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min until the ciabatta is warmed through and toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread a dollop of satay sauce on each toasted ciabatta base, then stack them up with the tofu fritters and some of the cucumber & shallot salad – these are your tofu fritter burgers

Serve the tofu fritter burgers with the chips and any remaining cucumber & shallot salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
