<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel the potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (save the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle, then whisk your egg[s], 35g <span class="text-purple">[50g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[70g]</span> flour, 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk and a pinch of salt in a jug, then place in the fridge to rest – this is your batter

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a separate pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 22-25 min, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the drained potatoes to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min

Fill 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>holes per person of a muffin tray with a very small drizzle of vegetable oil (about 1 tsp per hole) and put it in the oven for 8 min to heat up

Tip: No muffin tray? Fill a small oven-proof dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to make one giant Yorkshire!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After 8 min, remove the muffin tray from the oven and evenly drizzle the rested batter into the hot oil

Return the tray to the oven for 20 min until puffed up and golden – these are your Yorkshire puddings

Meanwhile, return the carrot[s] to a low heat with a knob of butter, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your carrot mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add your chicken breast portion[s] to the other side of the baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then return the tray to the oven for a further 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your roasties and roasted chicken breast

While the chicken is cooking, crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skin[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add your chicken stock mix and red wine paste to the pan with the crushed garlic, dried thyme and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your thyme gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the halved green beans to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and season with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted chicken breast with the roasties, Yorkshire puddings, carrot mash and cooked green beans to the side

Discard the crushed garlic from the thyme gravy and drizzle all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
