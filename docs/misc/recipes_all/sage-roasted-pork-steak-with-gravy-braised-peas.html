<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water - this is your chicken stock

Add a knob of butter and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the caramelised onions and cook for 1 min

Add the chicken stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until reduced to a gravy-like consistency

Once reduced, add your blanched peas and cook for a final 1 min or until they're warmed through – these are your gravy-braised peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted potato & parsnip and spoon over the gravy-braised peas

Top with the sage-roasted pork steak
