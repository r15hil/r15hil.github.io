<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a high heat

Tear off pieces of your lamb mince, roughly shape into small meatballs (about 6 per person!) and add directly to the pan with a generous pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

Cook for 2 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with your ground turmeric and a pinch of salt

Add 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your turmeric rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saucy lamb keema-style meatballs over the turmeric rice

Top with your nigella seeds
