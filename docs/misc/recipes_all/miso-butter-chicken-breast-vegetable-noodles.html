<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Melt 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter in a small bowl in the microwave for 20 secs (gently heat in a pot if you don't have a microwave!)

Once melted, add your soy sauce, white miso paste, a pinch of sugar and the chopped ginger and garlic and whisk to combine – this is your miso-butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the juice of half your lime[s] and the drained noodles to the pan and give everything a really good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until everything is nicely coated in the sauce – this is your miso-butter chicken breast & vegetable noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the miso-butter chicken breast & vegetable noodles and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
