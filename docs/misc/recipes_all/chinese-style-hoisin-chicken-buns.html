<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot, diced chicken breast and half the chopped ginger (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for an initial 6-7 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out into a rectangle approx. 15cm wide and 30cm long with a rolling pin

Cut the pastry rectangle into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> squares</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the hoisin sauce, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), cornflour and the larger sachet<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>of soy sauce (you’ll use the smaller one later!) and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Remove the pan from the heat and pull any larger pieces of chicken apart using two forks – this is your Chinese-style hoisin filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (skin on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the rest of the five-spice mix for another recipe

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and crispy – these are your five-spice chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dollop a spoonful of the Chinese-style hoisin filling into the centre of each pastry square (reserve the pan)

Brush the edge of each pastry square with a little bit of cold water, then bring the corners of the pastry squares together and gently twist until fully sealed – these are your Chinese-style hoisin buns

Add the Chinese-style hoisin buns to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray and put them in the oven for 15 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Rip the leaves off the spring greens (discard the tough stalks!), wash and pat dry with kitchen paper and set 2<span class="text-danger"> [4]</span> aside

Layer the remaining leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then add the remaining chopped ginger and sliced spring greens with the<span class="text-danger"> </span>whole leaves on top and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until tender – these are your gingery greens and steamed leaves</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, combine the chilli jam and toasted sesame seeds in a small bowl with the smaller soy sauce sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your dipping sauce

Place each steamed leaf on a plate with the Chinese-style hoisin buns on top

Serve the five-spice chips, gingery greens and dipping sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
