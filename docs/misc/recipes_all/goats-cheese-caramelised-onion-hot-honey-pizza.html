<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt

Cook the onion for 8-10 min or until it has softened and caramelised, then stir through half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) and cook for a final 30 secs - this is your caramelised onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Crumble your goats' cheese into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the tomato base between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon

Top with the torn mozzarella, caramelised onion, crumbled goats’ cheese and a generous pinch of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base[s] is crisp – this is your goats' cheese & caramelised onion pizza

Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely</p><br><br>

<p>Add the salad and chopped cucumber to a bowl with the remaining balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Toss to combine – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your honey with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 tsp]</span> warm water in a small bowl

Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a generous pinch of salt and stir together – this is your hot honey</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the goats' cheese & caramelised onion pizza with the dressed salad to the side

Drizzle the hot honey over the pizza[s] and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
