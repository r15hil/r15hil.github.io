<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water and add your saffron, then leave to infuse – this is your saffron stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic with your arborio rice and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the saffron stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the juice of half your lemon[s] to a mixing bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and whisk to combine – this is your lemon dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is ready, remove it from the heat and season with a pinch of salt

Tip: Your risotto should be porridge-like in consistency so if it is looking a little dry, add a splash of water

Stir most of your crab meat (save some for garnish!) and your clotted cream through the risotto – this is your saffron, crab & clotted cream risotto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad in the lemon dressing – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saffron, crab & clotted cream risotto topped with the dressed salad and reserved crab meat with a lemon wedge to the side

Season generously with pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
