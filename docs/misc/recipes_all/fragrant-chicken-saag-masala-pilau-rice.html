<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s] and your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it until it's wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool enough to handle

Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

Reboil the kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the sliced garlic, ground fenugreek, garam masala and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the softened onion and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Increase the heat to high and add the chicken breast strips to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until they are lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add the tomato stock and chopped spinach to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce thickens, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Melt a knob of butter in a pot with a matching lid over a medium heat

Once melted, add the crushed cardamom pods and star anise to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice to the pot and cook for 1 min further, then add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your pilau rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pilau rice is cooking, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Add the pulled chicken back to the curry and give it a good mix up – this is your fragrant chicken saag masala

Stir the chopped coriander through the pilau rice, discard the star anise and cardamom pods</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant chicken saag masala with the pilau rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
