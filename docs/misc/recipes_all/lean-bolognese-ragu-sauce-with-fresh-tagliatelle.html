<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the beef is browning, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dice your tomato[es] roughly

Once starting to brown, add the sliced garlic and diced tomato to the beef and cook for 2-3 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 2-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
