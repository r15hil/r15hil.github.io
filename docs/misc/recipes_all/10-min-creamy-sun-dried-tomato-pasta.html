<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pine nuts and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, transfer them to a bowl and set aside for later</p><br><br>
