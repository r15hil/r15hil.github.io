<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!


Boil half a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the diced chicken and most of the roasted garlic paste (save some for later) with a pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> Knorr chicken stock cube in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water 


Add the dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste to the chicken and cook for 1-2 min


Tip: Add more olive oil if the pan is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil 


Once the pan is hot, add the potatoes to the pan with the smoked paprika and season generously with salt and black pepper 


Cook for 6 min or until crisp and cooked through – these are your paprika potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chicken stock to the chicken pan and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tomato &amp; garlic chicken 


Note: Please ensure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt and black pepper – this is your garlic aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash and drain the seasonal salad, then add it to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining cider vinegar

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato &amp; garlic chicken with the paprika potatoes and dressed salad to the side


Drizzle over the garlic aioli 


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
