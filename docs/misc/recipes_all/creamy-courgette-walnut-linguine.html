Give everything a good mix up and cook for 5-6 min, or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the sauce is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Once thickened, add the drained linguine, half the basil (save some for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy courgette linguine

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy courgette linguine topped with the walnut crumb

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
