<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Cut your cauliflower[s] into small florets (discard the stem and leaves), then add the florets to a baking tray with your ground cumin, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the cauliflower has softened</p><br><br>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to soften

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add your cloves and a pinch of salt, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and ginger paste and cook for 1 min further

Add your ground turmeric and curry powder to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-6 min further or until thickened – this is your korma sauce</p><br><br>

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
