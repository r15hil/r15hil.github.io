<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then slice into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potato to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the potatoes are slightly golden

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free patty[ies] and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking up them up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once browned, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest laster!) and dried oregano to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, then set aside – this is your empanada filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut into 2 rectangles per person and add them to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide the empanada filling into 2 per person and add to the middle of the pastry rectangles

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry, then fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly, then use a fork to crimp along the join and prick air holes all over

Trim the edges of the pastry into a semi-circle shape – these are your meat-free empanadas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the initial 15 min, remove the potato tray[s] from the oven and crush with the base of a mug to flatten them

Add the sliced pepper to the tray with a pinch of salt – these are your smashed potatoes & pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven along with the meat-free empanadas for 18-20 min or until the potatoes are crisp and golden and the pastry is golden and cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice half your green chilli[es] finely, then cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander & parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the remaining chopped garlic and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a bowl with the chopped coriander & parsley, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your chimichurri sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free empanadas with the smashed potatoes & pepper to the side

Top the smashed potatoes with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), then drizzle with some of the chimichurri sauce

Serve the remaining chimichurri sauce to the side for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
