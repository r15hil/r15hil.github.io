<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle, then slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add the sliced potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, preheat the grill to medium-high

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large wide-based oven-proof pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until beginning to soften

Crack your eggs into a large bowl with your vegetable stock mix, chopped parsley, 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and a generous grind of black pepper

Whisk it all together – this is your egg mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), ground smoked paprika and wilted spinach and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan – this is your smoky veg

Lay the tomato rounds around the base of the reserved pan

Layer the sliced potatoes and smoky veg over the top and return to a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pour the egg mixture into the pan, pressing the vegetables down, and cook for 3-4 min or until the egg starts to brown on the bottom

Once brown, put the pan under the grill for 4-6 min or until the egg has set – this is your veg-packed Spanish-style omelette

Tip: Make sure you leave the pan handle outside of the oven and the door open whilst grilling!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the omelette is cooking, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining chopped garlic and mayo together with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic aioli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the veg-packed Spanish-style omelette into quarters and serve with the salad and garlic aioli to the side

Drizzle the salad with your cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
