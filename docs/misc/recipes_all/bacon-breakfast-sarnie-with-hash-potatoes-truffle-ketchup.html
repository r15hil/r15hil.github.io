<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Remove the potatoes from the microwave and add your ground smoked paprika with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Transfer the seasoned potatoes to a baking tray (or two!)

Add the tomato halves (seed-side up!) with a pinch of sugar, a small pinch of salt and pepper and a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your hash potatoes & roasted tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick and with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer the bacon to kitchen paper and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your tomato ketchup and truffle oil (not a fan of truffle? Just add a little!) in a small bowl with a small splash of water and a grind of pepper – this is your truffle ketchup

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Top the ciabatta base with the sliced tomato, bacon and grated cheese – this is your loaded base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the loaded base with a fried egg and a ciabatta lid – this is your bacon breakfast sarnie

Serve the hash potatoes, roasted tomato and truffle ketchup to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
