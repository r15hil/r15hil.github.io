<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ gas 5

Boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on!) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Wash your shredded kale and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a large splash of cold water and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, combine your soft cheese, vegetable stock mix, roasted garlic paste and Chinese rice wine to a jug with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml] </span>boiled water and mix until fully combined – this is your stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are nearly done, add the kale to the pot and cook, covered, for 3 min further or until the potatoes are tender and the kale is wilted

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the pot to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and the finely sliced white parts of the spring onion

Mash together until fully combined and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then keep covered until serving – these are your colcannon potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season on both sides with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the seasoned sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, transfer the cooked sea bass to a plate, reserve the pan</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat and add the stock and cook for 2 min or until the sauce begins to thicken to a gravy-like consistency

Once the sauce has reduced add the green parts of the spring onion stir it all together – this is your creamy pan sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked sea bass with the tenderstem broccoli and colcannon potatoes to the side

Spoon the creamy pan sauce over the cooked sea bass

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
