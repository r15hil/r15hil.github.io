<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions and cook for 3 min on each side

Remove the pot from the heat, then add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water, your chicken stock mix and half your soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!)

Return the pot to a medium-high heat and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your Brussels sprouts into quarters

Add 70ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> milk and your white wine vinegar to a bowl – this is your cheat's buttermilk

Add the chopped sprouts to the cheat's buttermilk, give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate

Tip: Don't worry if the mixture is a little lumpy, it's meant to be!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your dried cranberries roughly

Wash then remove leaves (2 per person!) from your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and set aside Chop the inner core into wedges

Combine 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> cornflour (save the rest for later!) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water – this is your cornflour mixture

Cut the brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board and return the pot with the leftover liquid to a high heat

Add the cornflour mixture and diced cranberries and whisk immediately to avoid any lumps

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce thickens – this is your gravy

Meanwhile, shred the cooked chicken apart using two forks – this is your pulled chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the gravy from the heat and add the pulled chicken, then cover to keep warm until serving

Drain the marinated sprouts from the cheat's buttermilk in a colander over the sink

Return the marinated sprouts to the bowl with the remaining soy sauce, dried sage and remaining cornflour and give it a good mix up to coat the sprouts thoroughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated sprouts and cook for 5-6 or until golden and crisp then transfer to kitchen paper – these are your sage-fried sprouts

Meanwhile, put the brioche halves in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Spoon out 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> of the gravy from the pot and mix it with your mayo – this is your gravy mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed brioche bun with 2 lettuce leaves, the sage-fried sprouts, a drizzle of honey (don’t have a sweet tooth? Go easy!) and a spoonful of pulled chicken – this is your crowd sauced chicken Christmas sarnie

Skewer the crowd sauced chicken Christmas sarnie with a reserved sage-fried sprout

Serve with the chips, lettuce wedges, gravy mayo and any remaining gravy to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
