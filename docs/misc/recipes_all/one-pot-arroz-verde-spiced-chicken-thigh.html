<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach and shake off any excess water

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop 1/3 of your green chilli[es] finely and roughly chop the remainder

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has slightly softened, add your chicken thighs to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the spinach, most of the coriander (save a few leaves for garnish!) and the roughly chopped chilli (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor

Blitz until very finely chopped – this is your arroz verde base

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, add your white long grain rice to the pan with the chopped garlic, ground coriander and ground cumin

Stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the arroz verde base and chicken stock, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for an initial 20-25 min or until the rice and chicken are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice is looking a little dry!

Meanwhile, add your mayo to a bowl with the remaining chopped chilli, a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of pepper

Mix until fully combined – this is your green chilli mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice and chicken are cooked, add your blanched peas to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Gently stir it all together and cook for a final 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your one-pot arroz verde & spiced chicken thigh</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot arroz verde & spiced chicken thigh drizzled with the green chilli mayo

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
