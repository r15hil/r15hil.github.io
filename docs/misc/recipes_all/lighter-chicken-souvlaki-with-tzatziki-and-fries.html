<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Soak your skewers in cold water (this stops them from burning whilst cooking!)

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, dried oregano and a pinch of salt – these are your herby fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your herby fries

Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Add the chopped chicken and half the grated garlic to a large bowl with your cumin seeds, ground smoked paprika, half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Thread the marinated chicken onto the soaked skewers – these are your marinated chicken skewers

Transfer the marinated chicken skewers to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 22-25 min or until the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken souvlaki skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice half your cucumber[s] into discs

Cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into slices

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Add the sliced tomatoes and sliced cucumber to a bowl with the remaining red wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cucumber & tomato salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the grated cucumber to a small bowl with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), most of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and season with a pinch of salt – this is your tzatziki</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken souvlaki skewers with the herby fries, cucumber & tomato salad and tzatziki to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
