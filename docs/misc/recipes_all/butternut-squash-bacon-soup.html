<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel the butternut squash<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and cut in half using a sharp knife

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard

Chop the butternut squash into small, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped butternut squash to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until softened and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the butternut squash is cooking, chop the streaky bacon finely

Heat a large, dry, pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer the bacon to kitchen paper and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 650ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and sliced garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, peel the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Once the onion has softened, add the chicken stock and chopped potato and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the stock is boiling, cook for 10-12 min or until the potato is beginning to break down

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Tear the ciabattas into rough, bite-sized pieces and add them to the tray

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese, pumpkin seeds and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until golden – these are your chilli-cheese croutons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potato has started to break down, add the roasted butternut squash to the pot and blend with a (stick) blender until a smooth soup remains

Tip: Add a splash more water if your soup is looking a little thick!

Taste for seasoning, adding a little more salt and pepper if needed – this is your butternut squash soup</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the butternut squash soup in bowls with a dollop of clotted cream

Top with the crispy bacon and chilli-cheese croutons

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
