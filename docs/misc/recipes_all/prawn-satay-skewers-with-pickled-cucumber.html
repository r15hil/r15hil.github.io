<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!) and combine with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your curry powder and a drizzle of coconut stock with a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl (save the rest of the coconut stock for later!)

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the bowl, mix well and set aside – these are your curried prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a separate pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your smooth peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining coconut stock and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-low heat

Cook for approx. 15-20 min or until it has reduced to the consistency of a thick custard, stirring occasionally – this is your satay sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice and satay sauce are cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sliced cucumber and sliced spring onion to a mixing bowl

Add a large pinch of salt and your rice vinegar

Mix well and set aside to marinate – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Thread the curried prawns onto the soaked skewers

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, cook the prawns for 3 min on each side, turning once, or until cooked through and slightly charred – these are your king prawn skewers</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the king prawn skewers over the brown rice with the quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the satay sauce all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
