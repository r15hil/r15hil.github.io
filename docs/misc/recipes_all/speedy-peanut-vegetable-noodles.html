Reduce the heat to medium, add the grated carrot and give everything a good old mix up until the sauce sticks to the noodles &ndash; these are your nutty sesame &amp; vegetable noodles


Tip: add a splash of starchy noodle water to loosen the mixture if it's looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with the black sesame seeds


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
