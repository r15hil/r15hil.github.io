<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden</p><br><br>

Add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and softened butter to a bowl and mix it all together – this is your harissa butter

Tip: If your butter is not softened then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!</p><br><br>
