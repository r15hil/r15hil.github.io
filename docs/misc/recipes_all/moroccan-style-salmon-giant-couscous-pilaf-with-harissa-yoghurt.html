<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the ground coriander, ground turmeric and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the cooked butternut squash, sultanas, giant couscous and veg stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the giant couscous is tender – this is your Morrocan-style pilaf</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pilaf is cooking, heat a separate large dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add the flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<p>Combine the natural yoghurt and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your harissa yoghurt

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<p>Once the couscous is tender, top the Morrocan-style pilaf with the salmon flakes and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the salmon is warmed through – this is your Morrocan-style salmon & giant couscous pilaf</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Morrocan-style salmon & giant couscous pilaf with a dollop of the harissa yoghurt

Sprinkle over the toasted flaked almonds and chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
