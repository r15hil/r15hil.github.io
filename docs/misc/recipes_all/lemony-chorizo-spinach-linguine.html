<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chorizo is cooking, zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Slice the remaining non-zested lemon into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then add it to the pan along with the juice of the zested lemon (reserve the wedges for garnish)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach is wilted and you are left with a loose sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony chorizo & spinach linguine</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemony chorizo & spinach linguine in shallow bowls and top with the lemon zest and a generous grind of pepper

Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
