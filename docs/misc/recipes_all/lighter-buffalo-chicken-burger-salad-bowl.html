<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rip the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rough, bite-sized pieces, then add it to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy croutons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the salad between your plates, and top with the lighter buffalo chicken
