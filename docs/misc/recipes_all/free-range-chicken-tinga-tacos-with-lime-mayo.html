<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Add your free range chicken thighs to a bowl and sprinkle over your ground cumin, ground coriander and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side, or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste in a bowl – this is your tinga paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the tinga paste and the sliced spring onion to the pan

Add 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and season with a pinch of salt

Cover with a lid and cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine your mayo with the juice of half your lime[s] and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl – this is your lime mayo

Tip: Roll the lime with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as pulling

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with the sauce and stir it all together – this is your free range chicken tinga

Slice the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the shredded lettuce, free range chicken tinga, grated cheese and lime mayo evenly between the warmed tortillas – these are your free range chicken tinga tacos

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
