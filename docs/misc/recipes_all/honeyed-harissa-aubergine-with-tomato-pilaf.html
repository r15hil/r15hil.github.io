<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don’t have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the aubergine half[ves] to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Add your honey and half of your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the middle of each aubergine half, cut side up, then spread it with the back of a spoon until coated

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the aubergine is soft and golden – this is your honeyed harissa aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your ground turmeric, ground cumin and vegetable stock mix with the roasted garlic paste and remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the dish

Add your white long grain rice and sultanas with 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your tomato pilaf</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bash your pistachios in the bag with a rolling pin

When the aubergine is almost done, remove the baking tray[s] from the oven and add the crushed pistachios to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 2-3 min or until the pistachios are toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the tomato pilaf with the honeyed harissa aubergine

Garnish with the toasted pistachios and drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
