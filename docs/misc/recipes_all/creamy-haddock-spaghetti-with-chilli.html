<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for just 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite (it will keep cooking in the sauce later!)

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to soften, add your roasted garlic paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), finely chopped tomatoes, Chinese rice wine and soft cheese to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 30 secs or until starting to thicken slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the sauce and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, add the drained spaghetti and a splash of the starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy haddock spaghetti with cherry tomatoes & chilli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Season the creamy haddock spaghetti with cherry tomatoes & chilli with a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
