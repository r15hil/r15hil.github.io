<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Roast the potatoes


Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 395&deg;F/ Gas 6.


Chop the potatoes (skins&nbsp;on) into small bite-sized pieces.


Strip the rosemary leaves from the stalks.


Crush the garlic (skins on) with the back of a knife.


Add the potatoes, rosemary leaves and crushed garlic to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up.


Put the tray in the oven and cook for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Prepare the steaks


Meanwhile, trim the fat from the rump steaks.


Cover the steaks in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until flat and approx. half a cm in thickness.&nbsp;


Tip: this will make the steaks really tender!

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Combine the chopped capers with the chopped basil leaves, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt&nbsp;&ndash; this is your lemon &amp; caper dressing.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Blanch the broccoli&nbsp;


Add the Tenderstem&nbsp;broccoli&nbsp;to a pot of&nbsp;boiling water&nbsp;with a pinch of&nbsp;salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until tender


Drain and rinse under&nbsp;cold water&nbsp;to cool them down slightly and stir through the&nbsp;lemon &amp; caper dressing.


Set this aside until serving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fry the steaks


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat.


Once hot, add the&nbsp;breaded steaks&nbsp;and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden brown.


Once done, transfer to a cooling rack (you can use the rack from your grill!) to rest and season with a pinch of&nbsp;salt.


Tip: resting on a cooling rack will make sure your crumb stays crisp!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges.


Serve the steak milanese with the rosemary &amp; garlic potatoes and lemon &amp; caper broccoli to the side.


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
