<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until charred and starting to soften

Once charred, transfer to a bowl and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pepper is cooking, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, transfer the basmati rice to a plate to cool and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your yellow mustard seeds and coriander seeds to a pestle & mortar with your ground cumin and roughly bash until you end up with a coarse powder – this is your spice mix

Drain and rinse your black beans

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with your ground turmeric and spice mix and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and chopped tomatoes with your vegetable stock mix, a grind of pepper and a generous pinch of salt and sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 7-8 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your green chilli[es] finely into rounds and add them to a bowl with your white wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt, then set aside – this is your quick-pickled green chilli

Once the sauce has thickened, add the charred pepper to the pan with half your cultured coconut (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your black bean curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-low heat with a small knob of butter, the remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until melted and fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooled basmati rice to the pot with the chopped coriander and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1 minute further or until warmed through – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the black bean curry with the coriander rice to the side

Dollop the remaining cultured coconut over the curry and top with the quick-pickled green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
