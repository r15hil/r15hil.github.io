<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat

Once hot, add the salmon fillets (skin-side down), season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – this is your pan-fried salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
