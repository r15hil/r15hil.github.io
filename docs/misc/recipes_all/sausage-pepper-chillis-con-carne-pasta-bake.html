<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> starchy pasta water

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!</p><br><br>

<p>Once the sausage meat has started to brown, add 3/4 of the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!), the diced pepper and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once slightly softened, add your ground cumin, ground paprika and ground coriander with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the drained black beans with your chopped tomatoes and chicken stock mix

Once boiling, add the drained farfalle to the pan with the reserved starchy pasta water and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish and top with the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy sausage & pepper chilli con carne pasta bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy sausage & pepper chilli con carne pasta bake with the chopped coriander and reserved diced onion sprinkled over the top

Season with a grind of black pepper
