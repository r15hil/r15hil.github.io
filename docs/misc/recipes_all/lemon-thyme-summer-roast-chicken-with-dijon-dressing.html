<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Top, tail, peel and slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into long batons

Slice 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> thin rounds from the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the carrot batons to an oven-proof dish with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and top with the thyme

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Season the chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and pepper

Lay the seasoned chicken breasts over the carrots and thyme, then top with the lemon rounds

Add the garlic cloves (no need to peel!) and the chicken stock to the dish, then put the dish in the oven for 30-35 minutes or until the carrots are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop the waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the blanched peas and rocket to a colander and pour cold water all over them to refresh them

Pat them dry with kitchen paper

Combine the Dijon mustard, the juice of the remaining lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and set aside to rest – this is your lemon & thyme summer roast chicken

Mix up the carrots and thyme, then discard the thyme stalks from the dish

Peel and mash the cooked garlic (with a fork), then add the mashed garlic and chicken juices from the dish, reserving the carrots and lemon rounds, into the bowl with the Dijon lemon mixture and whisk to combine – this is your Dijon dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Crush the drained potatoes lightly with a potato masher (or a fork!)

Once lightly crushed, stir in the refreshed peas and rocket – this is your potato & pea salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemon & thyme summer roast chicken with the carrots, lemon rounds and potato & pea salad to the side

Drizzle the Dijon dressing all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
