<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layers of your lemongrass and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, outer lemongrass layers and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Score the skin of the sea bass fillet[s] 3 or 4 times on the diagonal (be careful not to slice all the way through)

Season both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped lemongrass and tomato wedges to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your sambal oelek (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tamarind paste, ginger paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>sugar with a splash of water

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened - this is your hot & sour sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is done, remove the pot from the heat and add your mangetout and sugar snap peas (don't mix!) and put the lid back on (this steams the vegetables!)

Set aside for 3-4 min or until the vegetables are hot and tender but with a slight crunch

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked sea bass with the lemongrass rice, mangetout and sugar snap peas to the side

Spoon the hot & sour sauce over the sea bass

Garnish with the chopped coriander and your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
