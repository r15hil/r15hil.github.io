<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) into your waxy potatoes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – these are your hasselback potatoes

Tip: Place chopsticks either side of the potatoes to stop you cutting all the way through!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the hasselback potatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray and drizzle each with olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 35-40 min or until they're tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a microplane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the zested lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Mix your panko breadcrumbs, chopped parsley and lemon zest with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your herby breadcrumb mixture

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your salmon fillet[s], skin side down, to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Spread your Dijon mustard evenly all over the salmon with the back of a spoon

Tip: Not a fan of mustard? Just spread a thin layer!

Top the mustard salmon with the herby breadcrumb mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven for 14-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through and the crumb is crisp and golden – this is your herb-crusted salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and cook on a high heat for 1 min or until they're tender

Once cooked, drain and return the peas to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Crush the refreshed peas roughly with a potato masher

Stir your soft cheese, the juice of half the lemon[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) and a pinch of salt through the crushed peas

Give everything a good mix up, then warm through over a medium heat for 2 min – these are your creamy crushed peas

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herb-crusted salmon over the creamy crushed peas with the hasselback potatoes to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
