<p><strong>Description:</strong> Minestrone is a thick soup packed with veg, enjoyed all over Italy. In this verde (green) version, you'll be transported to Tuscany by a native ingredient – cavolo nero, also known as Tuscan kale. Softened leeks bring a buttery sweetness to the soup, which is finished off with a bright lemon & basil salsa.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat 


Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely


Once the pan is hot, add the sliced leeks with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Rip the leaves off the cavolo nero, discard the tough inner stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up &amp; slice into thin strips


Dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>Knorr vegetable stock cube<span style="color:#e86754;"> </span>and the green tomato chutney in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water – this is your soup base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the leeks have softened, add 2/3 chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant


Once fragrant, add the sliced cavolo nero and give everything a good mix up


Add the soup base and macaroni and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until the cavolo nero has wilted and the macaroni is cooked with a slight bite – this is your Tuscan minestrone</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the ciabatta roll<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 6 slices


Add the ciabatta slices to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper


Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the ciabatta slices are cooking, strip the basil leaves from their stalks and chop them roughly, discarding the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grind the chopped basil and remaining chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt in a pestle &amp; mortar to form a smooth paste


Add the juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (use half if you don't love the taste of lemon!) and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and mix well – this is your lemon &amp; basil salsa


Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, blitz in a food processor!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Using a peeler, create shavings of the Italian hard cheese


Tip: Grate any leftover cheese and sprinkle this into the soup</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Tuscan minestrone and drizzle with the lemon &amp; basil salsa 


Garnish with the cheese shavings


Buon appetito!</p><br><br>
