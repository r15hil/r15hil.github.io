<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Add the pepper halves, cut-side down, to the other side and press down with your hand to flatten it

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the chips and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the chips are golden and the pepper has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chips and pepper are cooking, combine your maple syrup with your Marmite, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your fiery Marmite glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to a separate bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add your meat-free chick'n and give everything a good mix up until they’re nicely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and warmed through – this is your crispy meat-free chick'n

Tip: Add more oil to the pan if it is looking a little dry

Meanwhile, slice your red chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the crispy meat-free chick'n to a plate covered with kitchen paper and carefully pour away any excess oil

Return the pan to a low heat, add the fiery Marmite glaze and cook for 30 secs or until starting to thicken

Return the crispy meat-free chick'n to the pan and give everything a good mix up or until coated in the glaze – this is your fiery Marmite-glazed meat-free chick'n</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Fill the toasted brioche bun[s] with a dollop of mayo, a roasted pepper half, the fiery Marmite-glazed meat-free chick'n and the salad

Serve the chips to the side and garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – these are your chilli fries

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
