<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the paneer and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Once the paneer is golden, transfer it to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a big pinch of salt, 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-8 min or until soft and starting to caramelise

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Heat a pot with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the crushed cardamom and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to the softened onion and cook for a further 5-8 min or until starting to brown, stirring occasionally

While the vegetables are browning, dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the tomatoes into wedges

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and curry powder to the pan and stir until the vegetables are coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 min, then return the paneer cubes to the pan with the tomato wedges and vegetable stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 5-10 min or until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your paneer jalfrezi

Meanwhile, add the plain naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Taste the paneer jalfrezi for seasoning, adding some pepper if you like it hot

Fluff the cooked basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter – this is your buttery cardamom rice

Serve the paneer jalfrezi with the buttery cardamom rice and warmed naan to the side (discarding the cardamom pods!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
