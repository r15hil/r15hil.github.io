<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and pepper strips and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Once softened, add half your ground cumin and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Once fragrant, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and drained chickpeas with the vegetable stock and your chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 8-9 min or until thickened and slightly reduced</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pods</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the cardamom seeds to a food processor with the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), white wine vinegar, the remaining ground cumin and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Add half the remaining chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), season with a pinch of pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your chilli zhoug</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, crack your egg[s] over the tomato sauce and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the eggs are cooked through – these are your one-pan poached eggs with harissa chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining chopped coriander with a generous knob of butter and the remaining chopped garlic and put in the microwave for 15-20 secs or until starting to melt – this is your garlic herb butter

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Spread the garlic herb butter over the toasted ciabatta – this is your garlic herb ciabatta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pan poached eggs with harissa chickpeas with the garlic herb ciabatta to the side

Dollop over your chilli zhoug and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
