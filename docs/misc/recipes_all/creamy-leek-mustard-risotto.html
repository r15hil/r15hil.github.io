<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-6 min or until the leek has slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and slice the remaining leek into rounds and wash thoroughly to remove any grit, then shake off any excess water

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the sliced leek has slightly softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the risotto has been cooking for 5-8 min, add the leek rounds to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until slightly charred and tender – these are your roasted leek rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, stir through your soft cheese, wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!), half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy leek & mustard risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy leek & mustard risotto topped with the roasted leek rounds

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
