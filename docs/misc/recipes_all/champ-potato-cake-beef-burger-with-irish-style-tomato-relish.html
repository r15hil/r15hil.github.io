<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Combine your pork & beef mince (remove the paper if required!) in a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] and sultanas finely

Add the chopped tomato and chopped sultanas to a pot with your tomato paste, white wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt and sugar and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your Irish-style tomato relish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the relish is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat, then once hot, add the pork & beef patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on one side or until browned

Once browned, turn the heat down to medium-high and flip the pork & beef patty[ies], then top with half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the cheese has melted and the patty is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy pork & beef patty

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fries have had an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top with the sliced spring onion and remaining grated cheese

Put the tray[s] back in the oven for a further 5-6 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your champ-inspired loaded fries

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread some of the Irish-style tomato relish over a toasted brioche base, then top with a cheesy pork & beef patty and a toasted brioche lid – this is your Irish-style pork & beef burger

Serve with the champ-inspired loaded fries, salad and remaining Irish-style tomato relish to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
