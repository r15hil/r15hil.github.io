<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your lean beef mince, grated onion, panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef meatballs and cook for 4 min, turning occasionally, or until they’re browned all over

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 70ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

Add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the meatballs and sauce to an oven-proof dish (or individual dishes)

Top with the torn mozzarella and put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until melted and bubbling – these are your cheesy lean beef meatballs

Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half, then add to a baking tray and put in the oven for 1-2 min or until slightly toasted

Once slightly toasted, spread each slice with butter and top with the remaining garlic, then return to the oven for a further 3-4 min

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper, then tear into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy lean beef meatballs with the garlic ciabatta and torn lettuce to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
