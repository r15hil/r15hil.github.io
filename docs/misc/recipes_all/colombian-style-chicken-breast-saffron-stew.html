<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock mix and saffron in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water – this is your saffron stock

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: add another drizzle of oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and pepper have softened, add the ground cumin, ground turmeric and garlic with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Add the browned chicken, chopped waxy potatoes, chopped tomato and saffron stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the potatoes and chicken are cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks, then return it to the pan

Add most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!), season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Colombian-style chicken breast & saffron stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Colombian-style chicken breast & saffron stew with the basmati rice to the side and garnish with the remaining coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
