<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Top, tail and slice the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into medium rounds and peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the leek is softening, roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Strip the thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Drain and rinse the butter beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until slightly thickened – this is your creamy veg mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the creamy veg mixture to an oven-proof dish

Carefully top with the softened potato discs (beware, they will be hot!)

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is bubbling and the potatoes are golden and cooked through – this is your plant-based winter squash & leek hotpot

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the hotpot has been cooking for 10 min, boil half a kettle

Chop the Tenderstem broccoli in half

Add the halved Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the plant-based winter squash & leek hotpot with the Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
