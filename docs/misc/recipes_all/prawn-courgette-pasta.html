<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 1-2 tbsp of olive oil to a large pan (preferably non-stick) on a medium heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the courgette pieces (not the ribbons) to the oregano and cook for 3-5 min, until softened, stirring often


Meanwhile, return to the pasta pot and once nearly finished cooking, submerge the ribbons for 30 sec-1 min, until just softened


Drain both, and reserve the pasta water for step 7</p><br><br>

Once melted, add the prawns and cook for 2 min or until pink and cooked through


Season to taste with salt and plenty of pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the pasta and courgette ribbons to the pan and mix well


Tip: If the pasta becomes too dry, add a few splashes of the reserved pasta water


Check for seasoning and serve
