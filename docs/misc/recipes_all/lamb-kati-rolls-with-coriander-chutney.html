<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add your lamb mince

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the lamb is cooking, add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt (if you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything finely)

Grind to a fine paste, then add your mayo with the juice of 1/4 of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s]

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir it all together – this is your coriander chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lamb is done, squeeze in the juice of 1/4 of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced lamb mince

Wash your lettuce, then dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed tortillas with the shredded lettuce, spiced lamb mince and tomato salad

Drizzle the coriander chutney all over and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
