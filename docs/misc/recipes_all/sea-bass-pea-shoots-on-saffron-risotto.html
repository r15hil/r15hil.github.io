<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the risotto is almost cooked, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your sea bass skin dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch with salt

Once hot, add your sea bass fillet[s], skin side down and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once your risotto has absorbed all the stock, remove the cooked risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheddar cheese and a generous knob of butter

Add the juice of half your lemon[s]

Season very generously with pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon and saffron risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
