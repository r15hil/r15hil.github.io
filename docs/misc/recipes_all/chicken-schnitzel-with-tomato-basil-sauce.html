<h4>Step 1</h4>

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your breaded chicken</p><br><br>

<p>While the chicken is cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to break down

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs, then add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> water with a pinch of pepper and sugar and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened – this is your tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your Dijon mustard and your white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your mustard dressing

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through the chopped basil and a knob of butter – this is your tomato & basil sauce

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the breaded chicken over the tomato & basil sauce with the crispy potatoes and shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the mustard dressing over the shredded lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
