<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add them to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the wedges are cooking, slice your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice the halves into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your red wine vinegar, yellow mustard seeds, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar, a splash of boiled water and a pinch of salt to a bowl and stir until dissolved

Add the cucumber wedges to the bowl and give everything a good mix up, then set aside – these are your quick-pickled cucumber wedges

Tip: Give the cucumber the occasional shake while pickling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a separate baking tray with tin foil

Add your meat-free patty[ies] to one side of the lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your vegan mayo, ketchup and mustard ketchup in a small bowl – this is your special sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free patty[ies] have cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice – this is your cheezy meat-free patty

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese flavour slice has melted and the plant-based brioche is warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the quick-pickled cucumber wedges and discard the liquid</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the special sauce on the brioche base, then top with a cheezy meat-free patty, a sprinkling of your crispy onions and a brioche lid – this is your American plant-based cheezeburger

Serve the potato wedges and quick-pickled cucumber wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
