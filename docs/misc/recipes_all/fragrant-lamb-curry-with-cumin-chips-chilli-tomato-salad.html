Add the chips to the baking tray (or two!) with your cumin seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

<p>Once the lamb has slightly browned, add your curry powder, garam masala, half the chopped tomato, half the diced onion (save the rest for later!) and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has started to soften</p><br><br>
