<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized chunks

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry, then boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, roughly chop your black olives

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper, chopped tomatoes and half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 3-4 min

Add your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook, covered for 15 min or until reduced to a stew-like consistency – this is your Provençal-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Grind the chopped black olives, remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a smooth paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your black olive tapenade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your hake to a tin foil-lined tray (or two!)

Divide and spread the black olive tapenade over the hake fillet[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the hake is cooked through – this is your black olive tapenade baked hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Season with salt and pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the black olive tapenade baked hake with the mash and Provençal-style sauce to the side

Add a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
