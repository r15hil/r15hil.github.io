<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Once the rice is cooked, transfer the pak choi to the same pot, without stirring


Tip: if the rice needs a little longer, then just wait until it's finished cooking before adding the pak choi


Cover the cooked rice and pak choi with a lid&nbsp;to keep warm until serving&nbsp;

<h4>Step 8</h4>
