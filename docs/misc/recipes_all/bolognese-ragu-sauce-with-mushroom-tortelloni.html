<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Once hot, add the beef mince to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the beef is browning, dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Once starting to brown, add the sliced garlic and diced tomato to the beef and cook for 2-3 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Tip: Use a ladle to spoon the starchy water from the cooking pasta!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tortelloni to the bolognese ragù and give everything a gentle mix up

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bolognese ragù tortelloni topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
