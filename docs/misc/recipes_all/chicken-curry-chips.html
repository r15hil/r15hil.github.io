<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, increase the heat to high, then add your diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min further or until the chicken is coated in all of the spices and is beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock and a pinch of salt to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once thickened, add a knob of butter and mix until fully combined – this is your chicken curry</p><br><br>

<p>While the curry is cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Combine the sliced onion and shredded lettuce in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken curry with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
