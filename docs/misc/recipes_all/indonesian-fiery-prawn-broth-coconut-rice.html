<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and coconut stock to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

Chop your lime leaf[ves] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot, ginger, garlic, chopped lime leaf[ves] and ground turmeric to a food processor with the chopped red chilli and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>cold water

Blitz into a paste – this is your fiery sambal

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the fiery sambal is cooking, dissolve your tamarind paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and your soy sauce and stir it all together – this is your tamarind stock

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Drain your king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the tamarind stock to the pan with the fiery sambal and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then add the king prawns to the pan along with the blanched edamame beans

Cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the edamame beans are tender with a bite – this is your Indonesian-style fiery king prawn broth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indonesian-style fiery king prawn broth with the coconut rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
