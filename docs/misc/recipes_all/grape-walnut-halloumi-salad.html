<p><strong>Description:</strong> Boiling halloumi removes some of its saltiness and alters the texture so it becomes pliable: with a rolling pin, you can flatten and roll it into halloumi steak, which you pan-fry until golden. Itâ€™s the only way to roll! Served with a grape and walnut bulgur for contrast. </p>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the drained bulgur wheat with a fork and stir through the grapes, celery, spring onion and walnuts


Serve the halloumi steaks over the bulgur and drizzle the Dijon dressing over


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
