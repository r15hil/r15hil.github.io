<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Meanwhile, zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, half the lime zest (you'll use the rest later!), chopped garlic, your chicken breast strips and a generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix and set aside – this is your marinated chicken

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and a pinch of salt in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 1 min on each side or until lightly browned

Once browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 8-10 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking,

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with the juice of half your lime[s], your mayo and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lime slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Finely dice your tomato[es] and cut the remaining lime[s] into wedges

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with the remaining lime zest, a squeeze of lime juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your tomato lime salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up so the chicken is evenly coated in the sauce – this is your chipotle pulled chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chipotle pulled chicken with the cooked rice, lime slaw and tomato lime salsa to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
