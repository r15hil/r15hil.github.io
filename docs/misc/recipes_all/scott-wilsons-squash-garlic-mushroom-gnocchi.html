<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ Gas 6

Add the butternut squash cubes to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt, a drizzle of olive oil and a splash of water

Tip: The water helps to cook the squash quicker!

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened, then transfer the softened onion to a plate and reserve the pan

Add the sliced mushroom and chopped garlic to the reserved pan and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the softened onion to the pan with the spinach and cook for 1-2 min or until wilted – these are your spinach & garlic mushrooms

Once the squash is tender, add it to a blender (or pan if using a stick blender) with the veg stock mix, 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water, 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk and half of the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Blitz until smooth – this is your squash sauce</p><br><br>
