<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced cucumber and carrot ribbons in a bowl with half of the Vietnamese-style marinade and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – this is your crunchy salad

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated pork along with any remaining Vietnamese-style marinade from the bowl and cook for 7-8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Vietnamese-style pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky rice topped with the Vietnamese-style pork and the crunchy salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Garnish with the chopped mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
