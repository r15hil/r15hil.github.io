<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips and cook for 1 min on each side or until lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Crumble your chestnut mushrooms directly into the pan with the chicken and cook for 4-5 min or until golden, stirring occasionally

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your soft cheese and grated garlic with 60ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> cold water, your wholegrain mustard (not sure about mustard? Try using less!) and chicken stock mix – this is your mustard sauce

Add the mustard sauce to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy mustard chicken

Tip: If it looks a little dry, add a splash of water!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl

Crush the cooked potatoes lightly with a fork, tear the wilted spinach over the top and give everything a good mix up – these are your spinach crushed potatoes

Tip: Just crush them gently, or they'll turn to mash!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy mustard chicken with the spinach crushed potatoes to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
