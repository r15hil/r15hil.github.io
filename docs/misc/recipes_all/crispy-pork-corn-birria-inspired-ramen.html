<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up into very small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pork is beginning to brown, add half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and crispy – this is your crispy pork</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add your tomato paste with your ground coriander and remaining ground smoked paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are tender – this is your corn birria-inspired ramen</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the corn birria-inspired ramen topped with the crispy pork, grated cheddar and sliced spring onion – this is your crispy pork & corn birria-inspired ramen

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
