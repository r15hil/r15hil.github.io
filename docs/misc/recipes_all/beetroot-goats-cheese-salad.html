<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your puy-style lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the puy-style lentils to a pot with plenty of cold water, bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped beetroot and your butternut squash cubes to a tray (or two!), drizzle everything with olive oil and a season with a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then drizzle half of your honey (you'll use the rest later!) over the butternut squash cubes

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until everything is tender and golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your walnuts finely (or bash them in the bag with a rolling pin!)

Chop your chives finely

Mix the chopped walnuts and chives together on the chopping board</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press your goats' cheese rounds into the chopped walnuts and chives

Tip: Apply a good amount of pressure so that the mix sticks to the cheese

Cover the coated goats' cheese with cling film and put it in the fridge until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining honey, balsamic vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your honey-balsamic dressing

Use the remaining time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, add the roasted butternut squash cubes and beetroot to the cooled lentils

Add half the honey-balsamic dressing (save the rest for later!) and mix it all up – these are your dressed vegetables

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the salad to a bowl

Break the coated goats' cheese into rough pieces and serve over the salad, along with the dressed vegetables

Drizzle over the remaining honey-balsamic dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
