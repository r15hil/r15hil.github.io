<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Drain and rinse your butter beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has softened, add your cracked black pepper and orzo to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the orzo in the oil

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut your lemon[s] into 1 slice per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the halved broccoli to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once tender, add the remaining chopped garlic and lemon zest to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant – this is your garlic & lemon broccoli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the orzo is cooked through, add the drained butter beans with your soft cheese, most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your butter bean & orzo cacio e pepe</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the butter bean & orzo cacio e pepe with the garlic & lemon broccoli to the side

Garnish with a lemon slice and top the orzo with the toasted pine nuts, remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
