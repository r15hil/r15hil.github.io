<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Chop your smoked streaky bacon in half (use scissors for speed!)

Once hot, add the halved bacon to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the bacon is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your baked beans to the pot with your ground smoked paprika, BBQ sauce, pomegranate molasses and a generous grind of black pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to medium</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the bacon is golden and crisp, add it to the pot and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened – these are your bacon & smoky Boston-style beans</p><br><br>
