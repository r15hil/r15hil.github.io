<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-9 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>
