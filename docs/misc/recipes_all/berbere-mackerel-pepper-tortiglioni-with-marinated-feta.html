<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a small pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove the skin from your smoked mackerel fillet and discard, then tear the mackerel into rough pieces

Once fragrant, add the mackerel pieces and chopped tomatoes to the pan with your vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the mackerel is warmed through – this is your berbere mackerel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Crumble your feta

Add the chopped coriander and crumbled feta to a small bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and crack of black pepper – this is your marinated feta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained tortiglioni to the berbere mackerel sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your berbere mackerel & pepper tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash of reserved starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the berbere mackerel & pepper tortiglioni in bowls and top with the marinated feta

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
