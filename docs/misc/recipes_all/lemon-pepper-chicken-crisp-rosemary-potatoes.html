<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


Add them to a pot of salted boiled water, bring to the boil&nbsp;over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until just cooked (known as parboiling)&nbsp;


Meanwhile, lay a sheet of tin&nbsp;foil onto a baking tray&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place your hand flat over the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> on a chopping board


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces


Add the sliced chicken to the foil&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the honey, Dijon mustard, chopped&nbsp;garlic, zest and juice of the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, 1-2 tsp pepper (freshly ground is best!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil &ndash;&nbsp;this is your lemon marinade&nbsp;


Spoon the lemon marinade over the chicken and scrunch the edges of the foil around the chicken (to stop it spilling out), leaving the parcel open


Put the tray in the oven for 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium-high heat


Once the butter has melted, add the potatoes with the chopped&nbsp;rosemary and a big pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until they're just starting to crisp &ndash; these are your&nbsp;saut&eacute;ed potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had an initial 15 min, add the saut&eacute;ed&nbsp;potatoes to the same tray and return the tray to the oven for 5 min, or until the chicken is cooked through


Meanwhile, wash and dry the baby&nbsp;leaf salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked lemon pepper&nbsp;chicken with the saut&eacute;ed potatoes and baby leaf&nbsp;salad to the side


Spoon the remaining lemon marinade&nbsp;over the chicken&nbsp;and salad


Enjoy!&nbsp;</p><br><br>
