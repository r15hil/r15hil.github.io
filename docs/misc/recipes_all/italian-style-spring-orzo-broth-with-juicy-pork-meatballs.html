<h4>Step 1</h4>

<p>Add the shredded spring greens and pork meatballs to the pot

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are cooked through, remove the pot from the heat and stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a knob of butter – this is your Italian-style spring orzo broth with juicy pork meatballs

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Italian-style spring orzo broth with juicy pork meatballs in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, chopped parsley and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
