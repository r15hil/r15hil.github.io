<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Combine the pork mince and egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a bowl with the panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!) and shape into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> meatballs – these are your pork meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork meatballs to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate (these will finish cooking in the broth later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the shredded spring greens and pork meatballs to the pot

Cook for 12-15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the orzo is cooked with a slight bite

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are cooked through, remove the pot from the heat and stir through half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a knob of butter – this is your Italian-style spring orzo broth with juicy pork meatballs

Meanwhile, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Italian-style spring orzo broth with juicy pork meatballs in bowls

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, chopped parsley and a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
