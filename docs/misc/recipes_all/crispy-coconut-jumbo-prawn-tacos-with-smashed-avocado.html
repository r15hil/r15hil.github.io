<h4>Step 1</h4>

Add a pinch of salt and sugar to a bowl with a splash of boiled water and stir everything together until dissolved

Once dissolved, add your cider vinegar and sliced green chilli and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a bowl

Crack your egg[s] into a separate bowl and beat with a fork

Combine your panko breadcrumbs and chopped coconut flakes in another bowl – these are your coconut breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Coat the jumbo prawns in the flour, tap off any excess, then add into the beaten egg and finally press into the coconut breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your breaded jumbo prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the breaded jumbo prawns and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your crispy coconut jumbo prawns

Tip: Do the prawns in batches if you need to so you don't overcrowd the pan!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the prawns are cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Cut your lime[s] into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To make your tacos, pile the warmed tortillas with your smashed avocado, the chopped lettuce, diced tomato and the crispy coconut jumbo prawns

Top with the quick-pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
