<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of peri-peri spice mix (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your peri-peri chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the capers finely

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped capers and mayo in a small bowl with half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli tartare sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the cornflour and 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour to a large bowl with the remaining peri-peri spice mix and a generous pinch of salt

Add 80ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> very cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>When the chips are almost done, pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and cut each fillet in half

Sprinkle both sides of the basa with flour, then tap off any excess

Dip the floured basa into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your peri-peri battered fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the blanched peas, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a splash of cold water to a pot over a medium heat

Once warm, add a large knob of butter and a pinch of salt and mash the peas roughly

Remove the pot from the heat and stir through the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon – these are your chilli mushy peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the peri-peri battered fish with the peri-peri chips, chilli mushy peas and a dollop of chilli tartare sauce to the side

Garnish with a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
