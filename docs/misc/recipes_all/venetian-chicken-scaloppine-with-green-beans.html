<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are roasting, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Once the pan is hot, add your lemon half[ves] (cut-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until caramelised, then set aside for later, reserving the pan

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and approx. 1cm in thickness</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a clean tray or plate and season generously with salt and pepper

Dip the flattened chicken into the seasoned flour until both sides are well coated and shake off any excess flour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wipe out the reserved pan with kitchen paper, then return to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Venetian-style chicken scaloppine

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once done, drain and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add your clotted cream to the pan

Squeeze in the juice of half your caramelised lemon and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your lemon sauce

Cut the remaining caramelised lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Venetian-style chicken scaloppine with the crispy roast potatoes and green beans to the side

Drizzle the lemon sauce all over the chicken

Garnish with a caramelised lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
