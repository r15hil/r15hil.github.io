<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your dried oregano, half your ground paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, peel and chop your red onion[s] in half

Chop half the chopped onion<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Slice the remaining chopped onion finely and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

Slice your tomato[es] into wedges

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your halloumi into thick strips

Add the halloumi strips to a bowl with the onion petals, ground cumin, the remaining ground paprika and a drizzle of olive oil

Mix it all together until the halloumi and onion are well coated – these are your spiced halloumi strips & onion petals</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non stick) over a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the spiced halloumi strips & onion petals

Cook for 4-5 min, turning the halloumi halfway, or until it is golden on all sides and the onion has slightly softened – this is your halloumi doner</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the halloumi is cooking, combine your red chilli relish and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fries are almost done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top the fries with your wholemeal pitta[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the warmed pitta with the halloumi doner and some of the shredded lettuce, sliced onion and tomato wedges

Drizzle over the sweet chilli sauce, garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander

Serve the smoky fries and remaining shredded lettuce, onion slices and tomato wedges to the side and drizzle with a little olive oil and enjoy!</p><br><br>
