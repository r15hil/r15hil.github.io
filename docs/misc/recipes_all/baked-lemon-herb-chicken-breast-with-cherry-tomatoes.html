<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add them to a large oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic cloves by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Pat your chicken breast portion[s] dry with kitchen paper and season them with a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your seasoned chicken and crushed garlic to the dish with your cherry tomatoes, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, leaving the chicken at the top and put the dish in the oven for an initial 10-15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your dried basil and dried oregano – this is your herby stock

Slice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] into slices and set them aside for later

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the dish to the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baked lemon & herb chicken with cherry tomatoes

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, add a few knobs of butter to the potatoes and leave to melt

Tear your parsley and dill all over the baked lemon & herb chicken with cherry tomatoes

Drizzle the shredded lettuce with some olive oil and serve it alongside
