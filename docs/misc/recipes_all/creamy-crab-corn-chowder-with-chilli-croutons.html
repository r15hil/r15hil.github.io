<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Once the leek has slightly softened, add the chopped potato, sliced garlic and 2/3 of the drained sweetcorn (you'll use the rest later!)

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chowder base is cooking, tear your bread roll[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into small bite-sized pieces and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray with the remaining drained sweetcorn and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until crispy and golden – this is your chilli croutons & sweetcorn

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

Mix everything together until fully combined – this is your creamy crab & corn chowder</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy crab & corn chowder topped with the chilli croutons, caramelised sweetcorn and remaining crab meat

Season with a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
