<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Peel and grate your garlic

Cut your orange[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the grated ginger, grated garlic, soy sauce and the juice of the orange[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in a small bowl – this is your zingy ginger & orange dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once browned, add 1/3 of the zingy ginger & orange dressing (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and coated in a sticky sauce – this is your zingy ginger & orange chicken

Add your toasted sesame oil and cider vinegar to the remaining zingy ginger & orange dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Chop the root off your lettuce and discard, then separate the leaves, give them a wash and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber into discs, then slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the blanched edamame beans and cucumber matchsticks to the brown rice with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your brown rice salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the zingy ginger & orange chicken over the brown rice salad with the lettuce leaves and carrot ribbons to the side

Drizzle the reserved zingy ginger & orange dressing all over

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
