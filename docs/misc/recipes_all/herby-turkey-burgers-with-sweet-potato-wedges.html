<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the sweet potatoes into wedges

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the turkey mince, panko breadcrumbs, grated onion, dried oregano and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper
