<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and dice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>shallot[s]

Slice the remaining shallot finely

Add the diced shallot to a large bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy – this is your crispy shallot

Once crispy, transfer to a small bowl or plate and set aside (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Once browned, add your red Thai curry paste with a couple of splashes of cold water and cook, covered, for a further 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s] and roughly chop your peanuts

Add the grated carrots, chopped coriander and chopped peanuts to the quick-pickled shallot and mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled Asian-style slaw

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray with the fries from the oven and add the brioche halves

Return the tray to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai-style chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, add a little sriracha mayo to the warmed brioche base and top with the Thai-style chicken, crispy shallot, some quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and a warmed brioche lid

Serve with the crispy fries, remaining quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and remaining sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
