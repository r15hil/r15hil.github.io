<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the chicken strips to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and sprinkle over your curry powder, turn the chicken strips into the curry powder several times until they’re all nicely coated

Put the tray in the oven for 15-16 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a separate baking tray and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 1-2 min!)

Cut your cheddar cheese in half on a diagonal so that you're left with two triangles

Slice each cheddar triangle into 4 so that you're left with 4 slices per person

Slice the ciabatta[s] into 4<span class="text-danger"> </span>slices per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the tortillas are warmed through, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a chopping board

Add the ciabatta slices to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put them in the oven for 3-4 min or until crisp and lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your dressing

Slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Add the pulled chicken to a large bowl with your mayo, half your mango chutney (save the rest for later!), your sultanas and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your speedy coronation chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Fill the warmed tortillas with a small handful of salad (you'll use the rest later!) and some speedy coronation chicken – these are your coronation chicken wraps

Tip: Wrap them up using tin foil or baking paper to take them on your picnic!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread each toasted ciabatta slice with some butter, then top with a cheddar slice and a small dollop of the remaining mango chutney

Sprinkle over your nigella seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and some sliced spring onion – these are your cheesy nibbles

Tip: Taking this on a picnic? Pack everything up separately and build them when you're there!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coronation chicken wraps with the cheesy nibbles and remaining salad to the side

Top the salad with the tomato wedges and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
