<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a medium heat with a knob of butter, half your rosemary leaves (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!</p><br><br>

Put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your hearty lean beef, carrot & mustard pie</p><br><br>

Once the pie is almost done, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 3-4 min or until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hearty lean beef, carrot & mustard pie with the tender spring greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
