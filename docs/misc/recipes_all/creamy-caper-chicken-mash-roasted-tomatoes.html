Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy caper chicken & green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy caper chicken & green beans with the mash to the side

Pour the remaining creamy caper sauce over the chicken and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
