<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways (including the stalks)

Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin, then rub the flesh with a large drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Add the aubergine half[ves] to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!), cut side up and put in the oven for an initial 20 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the aubergine is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your basmati rice, chopped creamed coconut and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped pineapple, chopped shallot, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander in a bowl

<p>Combine your ginger & garlic paste and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>reserved pineapple juice in a separate bowl

Add your ground allspice, dried thyme, vegetable stock mix, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your spiced glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and spoon the spiced glaze over the softened aubergine

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until caramelised – this is your Caribbean-style aubergine

While the aubergine is cooking, drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, return it to a medium heat with the drained black beans and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans are warmed through – this is your coconut rice & beans

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Caribbean-style aubergine with the coconut rice & beans and pineapple salsa to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
