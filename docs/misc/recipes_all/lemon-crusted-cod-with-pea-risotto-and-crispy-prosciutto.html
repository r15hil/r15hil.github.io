<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Once the shallot is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the risotto is cooking, add your sliced prosciutto to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-7 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your panko breadcrumbs with the chopped parsley, lemon zest, remaining chopped garlic, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your lemon breadcrumbs

Add your cod fillet[s] to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and top with the lemon breadcrumbs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until cooked through – this is your lemon crusted cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate any remaining Italian hard cheese

Once cooked, stir your blanched peas through the risotto with the grated Italian hard cheese, the juice of half the lemon[s], a knob of butter, and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your pea risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pea risotto topped with the lemon crusted cod

Garnish with the Italian hard cheese shavings, crispy prosciutto, a lemon wedge and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
