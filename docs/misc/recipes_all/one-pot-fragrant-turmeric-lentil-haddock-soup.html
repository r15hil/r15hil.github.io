<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5 min <span class="text-danger">[10 min]</span> to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the tomatoes roughly

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped tomato, chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the dish

Add the ground turmeric, black mustard seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), red lentils and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock mix, creamed coconut and 750ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L] </span>boiled water to the dish and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until the lentils are tender – this is your turmeric & lentil soup

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the turmeric & lentil soup is ready, remove the dish from the oven and add the haddock bites and a pinch of salt

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Cover with the lid and return the dish to the oven for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your one-pot fragrant turmeric & lentil haddock soup

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the baby kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby kale to a baking tray with the cumin seeds, a pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Massage the kale with clean hands so that the kale is evenly covered in oil

Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until it's crispy – this is your crispy cumin kale</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot fragrant turmeric & lentil haddock soup in bowls and top with the crispy cumin kale

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
