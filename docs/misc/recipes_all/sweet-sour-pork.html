<p><strong>Description:</strong> Sweet n’ sour is a gratifying Friday night favourite, usually consumed after dialling for a takeaway. Our sweet n’ sour is quick and fresh, yet still emulates an authentic Chinese. The natural juice from the pineapple is the 'sweet' element, so no need to add sugar, while sharp rice vinegar is the 'sour'.</p>
