<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cornflour to the bowl and toss to coat them evenly


Add the chips to a baking tray, skin-side down (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Put the tray in the oven&nbsp;for 30-35 min or until the chips are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chickpeas (and remaining liquid) to a food processor with the garlic, parsley, breadcrumbs, tahini, cumin, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Blitz until smooth, scraping down the sides of the mixer midway - this is your falafel batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the falafel batter to the pan, one large spoonful at a time, making 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> even portions (work in batches if your pan isn't big enough)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cook your falafel for 8-10 min turning half-way through (you may need more oil at this point)


Tip: gently press with a spatula after turning to flatten out and help cook evenly


Cook&nbsp;until golden brown on each side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel, top and tail the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Continue to peel lengths off the carrot until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Peel the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> the same way, discarding the seedy inner core


Mix the ribbons&nbsp;together</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the falafel and the sweet potatoes with&nbsp;the ribbon salad to the side


Top your salad with the yoghurt and garnish with nigella seeds


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
