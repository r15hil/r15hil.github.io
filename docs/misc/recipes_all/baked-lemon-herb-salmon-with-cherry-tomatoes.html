<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add them to a large oven-proof dish (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife (but keep the skin on!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the crushed garlic to the dish[es] with your cherry tomatoes, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the dish[es] in the oven for an initial 40 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your dried basil and dried oregano – this is your herby stock

Slice half your lemon[s] into rounds and set aside for later

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 40 min, remove the dish[es] from the oven and pour the herby stock all over the potatoes and tomatoes

Top with your salmon fillet[s] (skin side up!)

Squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon and top the salmon with the reserved sliced lemon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the dish[es] to the oven for 14-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through – this is your baked lemon & herb salmon with cherry tomatoes

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, add a few knobs of butter to the potatoes and leave to melt

Tear your parsley & dill all over the baked lemon & herb salmon with cherry tomatoes (watch out for the garlic skins!)

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle with some olive oil
