<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your arborio rice and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry

Add your vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!) and set aside for garnish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s]

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Add a knob of butter and the grated cheese to the pan and stir to combine – this is your lemony risotto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, drain your king prawns then add to the pan with the remaining garlic, chopped courgette and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your garlic king prawns & courgette

Once cooked, remove from the heat and stir through most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic king prawns & courgette over the lemony risotto

Garnish with a lemon wedge, the lemon zest and reserved chopped parsley

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
