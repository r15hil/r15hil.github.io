<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the sausages in half

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are cooked through, carefully slice them in half (they will be very hot!) and scoop the flesh out into a large bowl, leaving a little around the edges of the skin

Combine the potato flesh with the sliced spring onion, half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a knob of butter and mash it all together with a fork – this is your cheesy chipotle filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the potato skins to a baking tray and divide the cheesy chipotle filling between them, then top with the remaining cheese and drizzle with some olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until golden brown – these are your cheesy potato skins

Wash the lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, increase the heat to medium-high then add the smoked paprika, ground cumin and tomato paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water and the baked beans and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened – these are your bangers & beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bangers & beans with the cheesy potato skins and lamb's lettuce to the side

Dollop over the natural yoghurt and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Drizzle some olive oil over the lamb's lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
