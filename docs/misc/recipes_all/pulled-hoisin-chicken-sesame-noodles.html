<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a pinch of both salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until they're browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut a few rounds from your red chilli[es] (set them aside for garnish!), then cut the remaining red chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Once the chicken has browned, add a splash of water and cook, covered for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your wholewheat noodles to a large pot, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles, and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spring green[s], then rip the leaves off, discard the tough stalks, and layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and shred the chicken apart with two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Once pulled, return the pan to a medium heat and add the chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), hoisin sauce, half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>water and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken is coated in a sticky sauce – this is your pulled hoisin chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until starting to wilt

Add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 2 min or until completely wilted, then stir in the cooked noodles, toasted sesame oil and remaining soy sauce – these are your sesame noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pulled hoisin chicken over the sesame noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds, reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
