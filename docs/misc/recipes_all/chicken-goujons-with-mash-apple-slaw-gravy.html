<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the air fryer to 200°C, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a small bowl, then add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate with your ground paprika

Chop your chicken breast strips in half, lengthways, then season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Coat the chicken strips in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Add the breaded chicken strips to the air fryer basket and spray generously with olive oil, then cook for 10-12 min, turning halfway (air fryer cooking times may vary), or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken goujons

Tip: Air fryers work best when the food is spaced out in a single layer. You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a large heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While everything is cooking top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your apple[s] (skin on) into matchsticks

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your mayo to a large bowl with your cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your slaw dressing

Add the grated carrot, apple matchsticks and shredded lettuce to the slaw dressing and toss together – this is your apple slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> flour, your chicken stock mix and a pinch of pepper in a measuring jug

Gradually stir in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water (this is to ensure there's no lumps!) and your Marmite – this is your gravy mix

Put the gravy mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring thoroughly halfway – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are cooked, add a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken goujons with the mash, apple slaw and gravy to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
