Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chips have been cooking for 15 min, add your meat-free patty[ies] to a separate tray (use tin foil to avoid mess)

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half, then reassemble</p><br><br>

Top the patty[ies] with a cheese flavour slice and add the sliced brioche bun[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheeze has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl of dressing and gently mix together</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed brioche bun with some olive & basil tapenade and a cheezy meat-free burger patty – this is your Italian-style plant-based burger

Serve the chips, dressed salad and any remaining olive & basil tapenade to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
