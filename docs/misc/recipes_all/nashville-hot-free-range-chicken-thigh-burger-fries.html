<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add 80ml<span class="text-purple"> [120ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [160ml]</span> milk to a bowl with half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add your free range chicken thighs to the marinade, give everything a good mix up, then set aside for later (this will help to tenderise your chicken!) – this is your marinated free range chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the cucumber discs and cucumber batons to a bowl with the remaining cider vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp] </span>flour to a plate, season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your flour mix

Add the marinated free range chicken thighs to the flour mix, then press firmly into the mixture, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – this is your coated chicken

Discard any remaining marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated free range chicken and cook for 9-10 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy fried free range chicken

Reserve the pan and the remaining cooking oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your sriracha and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small heatproof bowl with a pinch of salt

Carefully pour the remaining cooking oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up – this is your chilli oil

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread your mayo on the warmed brioche base, then top with the quick-pickled cucumber discs and crispy fried free range chicken, then drizzle the chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the top

Top with the warmed brioche bun lid and serve the fries and quick-pickled cucumber batons to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
