<h4>Step 1</h4>

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your breaded free range chicken

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to break down

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs, then add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> water with a pinch of pepper and sugar and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened – this is your tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your Dijon mustard and white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your mustard dressing

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through the chopped basil and a knob of butter – this is your tomato & basil sauce

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the breaded free range chicken over the tomato & basil sauce with the crispy potatoes and salad to the side

Drizzle the mustard dressing over the salad
