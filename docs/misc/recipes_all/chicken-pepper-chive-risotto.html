<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to a tin foil lined-baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Transfer the browned chicken to the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min until the pepper has roasted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water, then add your tomato paste, Chinese rice wine and chilli relish – this is your sweet tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min until softened but not browned

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your arborio rice, chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min further

Add 1/3 of the sweet tomato stock and stir continuously until absorbed

Continue to add the remaining sweet tomato stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken and half of the roasted pepper into the risotto (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up

Once the rice is cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in half of your grated cheese and half of the chopped chives, then season with a grind of pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the chicken, pepper & chive risotto with the reserved roasted pepper and the remaining grated cheese

Garnish with the chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
