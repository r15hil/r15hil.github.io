<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much of the water out of the cooled spinach as you can, then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the conchiglie to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once golden, add the chopped courgette core to the pan and cook for 2 min further or until softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained conchiglie and courgette ribbons to the pan with the bacon lardons and the mint & basil pesto

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your mint & basil pesto, courgette & bacon conchiglie

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mint & basil pesto, courgette & bacon conchiglie and sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the remaining chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil
