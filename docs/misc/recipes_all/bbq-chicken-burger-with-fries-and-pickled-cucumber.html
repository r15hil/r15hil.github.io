<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and cut your potatoes into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the fries are cooking, cut your cucumber into batons

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the butterflied chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min on each side until golden, then turn the heat down to medium and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, coat the chicken with your BBQ sauce – this is your BBQ chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread your mayo on the toasted brioche base then top with the BBQ chicken, shredded lettuce, and a toasted brioche lid

Serve the BBQ chicken burger with the fries and quick-pickled cucumber to the side
