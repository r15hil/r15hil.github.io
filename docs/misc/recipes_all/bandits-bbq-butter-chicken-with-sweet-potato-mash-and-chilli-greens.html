<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your chicken escalope</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chicken escalope[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Divide the BBQ butter evenly between each piece of chicken, then top with the smokey breadcrumbs and reserve the bowl

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through and golden (no pink meat!) – this is your BBQ butter chicken</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the chicken is in the oven, add the chopped sweet potato to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your trimmed green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until tender

Return the potatoes to a low heat with the remaining butter and a splash of milk

Season with a generous pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the BBQ butter chicken with the green beans and sweet potato mash to the side

Drizzle the green chilli dressing over the green beans and garnish with the chilli rounds – these are your chilli greens
