<p><strong>Description:</strong> ''I have fond memories of a tiny breakfast spot I chanced upon in Chiang Mai where they served their khao tom with juicy handmade meatballs, and I've been doing them the same since then. This dish is light, soothing and takes minutes to prepare'' - Chef Shu Han Lee</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate)


Bash the lemongrass stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with a rolling pin, cut it <span class="text-danger">[them]</span> down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once combined, pick up the mixture and slam it down forcefully back into the bowl (this gets rid of any air pockets and brings the mixture together so it holds its shape when cooking)


Repeat until the mixture comes together and becomes sticky and dense</p><br><br>

Boil a kettle for the next step</p><br><br>

Once boiling, add the rice and outer lemongrass leaves, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 min or until the rice is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is tender, add the shaoxing wine, fish sauce, a big pinch of sugar and 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> more boiled water&nbsp;


Carefully drop the meatballs into the stock, then cover and cook for approx. 5-8 min or until the meatballs are cooked through


&nbsp;


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide&nbsp;the meatballs, rice and broth between bowls (remove the lemongrass!)
