<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Some of this recipe can be prepped ahead (if you like!)

Make steps 2-6 the night before and finish the rest in the morning! Let the dish cool completely (within 2 hours max), then cover and store in the fridge ready until morning and enjoy within 24 hours

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs

Once done, drain and refill the pot with ice-cold water and the cooked egg[s] then set them aside to cool</p><br><br>

<p>Reboil the kettle

Chop your tomato[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can – this is your blanched spinach</p><br><br>

<p>Add the juice of half the lime[s] to a small bowl with your red chilli relish, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/1 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli sauce

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, spread over a knob of butter and slice into triangles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Layer the chopped tomato, smashed avocado and blanched spinach

Top with the egg quarters and drizzle over the sweet chilli sauce

Sprinkle over your black sesame seeds, crispy onions and smoked salt

Garnish with a lime wedge and serve your buttered toasted ciabatta to the side

Time to start your day!</p><br><br>
