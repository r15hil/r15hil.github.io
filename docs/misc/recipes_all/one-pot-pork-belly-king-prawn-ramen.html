<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then season with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the pork belly (fat-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly golden

Once golden, flip and cook for 2 min on the other side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add the sliced spring onion to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar then give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled spring onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pork belly is lightly golden, add your white miso paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ginger & garlic paste to the dish

Add your soy sauce, chicken stock mix, toasted sesame oil and 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1.1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 55 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 55 min, remove the dish from the oven, then drain your king prawns and add them to the dish with the grated carrot, spinach and fine egg noodles

Tip: Nestle the noodles into the sauce for even cooking!

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the noodles are tender and the prawns and pork belly are cooked through – this is your one-pot pork belly & king prawn ramen</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, slice the cooked pork belly as thinly as you can on a clean board

To serve, top the one-pot pork belly & king prawn ramen with the sliced pork belly and garnish with the quick-pickled spring onion
