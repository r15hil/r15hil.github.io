<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the halved potatoes to a baking tray with your ground turmeric, half the garam masala (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once softened, add your vegetable stock mix, remaining garam masala, 3/4 of your curry powder (save the rest for later!), creamy single soy and grated cheeze to the pot and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your curried cheeze sauce</p><br><br>
