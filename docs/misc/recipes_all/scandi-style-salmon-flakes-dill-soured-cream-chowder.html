<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the sliced leek and sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and Dijon mustard in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy veg stock

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the leek and shallot have softened, add the chopped garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped potatoes and creamy veg stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce to heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, reboil a kettle

Tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until crisp and golden – these are your croutons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add your salmon flakes, capers, most of the chopped dill (save some for garnish!) and chopped spinach to the pan

Add half your soured cream (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your Scandi-style salmon & dill chowder</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Scandi-style salmon & dill chowder and top with the croutons

Dollop over the remaining soured cream and garnish with the remaining chopped dill

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
