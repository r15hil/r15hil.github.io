<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once fragrant, add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later) and cook for a further 3-4 min or until caramelised – these are your balsamic onions

<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest

Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the steak is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted and charred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread a dollop of horseradish mayo on the toasted ciabatta base, then top with a handful of salad, sliced steak and balsamic onions

Top with a toasted lid and serve with the chips and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining balsamic vinegar over the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
