<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, take your steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato and half the dried oregano to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) half the garlic, then finely slice the remaining garlic

Wash, the spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Bash the fennel seeds in their bag with a rolling pin until lightly crushed

Add a large knob of butter to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Once the butter has melted, add the crushed fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) and the remaining dried oregano to the bowl with the chopped shallot, panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your fennel stuffing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After the potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the stuffing-topped pork loin steaks to the tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to the oven for a final 13-15 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your roast pork loin with fennel stuffing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the steaks are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and shredded spring greens to the pan with the chopped tomatoes and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until the greens are wilted and the tomato is broken down – these are your spring greens all'aglio

Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock mix and red wine paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter

Once melted, add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and bring to the boil, then cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your red wine gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roast pork loin with fennel stuffing with the spring greens all'aglio and crispy potatoes to the side

Drizzle the red wine gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
