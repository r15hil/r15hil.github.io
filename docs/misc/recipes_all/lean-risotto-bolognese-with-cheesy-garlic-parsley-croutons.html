<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once softened, add your lean beef mince to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomatoes, dried oregano and beef stock and cook for 25-30 min, stirring frequently, until all of the stock has been absorbed, the rice is cooked and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lean beef risotto bolognese</p><br><br>
