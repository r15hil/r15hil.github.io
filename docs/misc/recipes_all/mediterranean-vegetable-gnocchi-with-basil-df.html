<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Cut the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways then slice finely

Once the pan is hot, add the sliced courgette with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Once the courgette has slightly softened, add the roasted garlic paste, dried oregano and the halved tomatoes

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the tomatoes have started to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi and reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water</p><br><br>

<p>Once the tomatoes have slightly softened, add the tomato frito and half <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> the black olives with a generous pinch of black pepper and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining olives for another recipe!
