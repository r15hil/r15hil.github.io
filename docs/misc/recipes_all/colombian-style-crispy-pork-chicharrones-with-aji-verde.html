<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side, horizontally in lines, approx. an inch thick by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Cut the scored pork in half, lengthways

Season with a very generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the fat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 4 min or until golden and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side

Once done, transfer the pork to a tin foil-lined baking tray (reserve the pan!) and put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until cooked through – this is your pork chicharron</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop as finely as you can

Chop your coriander very finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the sliced spring onion with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped coriander and white wine vinegar in a bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your aji verde</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the pork has 15 min left, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the onion wedges and cook for 6-7 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the tomato wedges with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, sugar and pepper

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[80ml] </span>boiled water and cook for 6-7 min or until softened but not completely broken down – this is your hogao-style tomato</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork chicharron over the cooked rice with the hogao-style tomato to the side

Add the aji verde to a small pot for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
