<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml] </span>cold water, your ground coriander and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked through once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
