<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and cut into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] and cut into bite-sized pieces, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper, aubergine and courgette with a large pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until the vegetables are starting to brown slightly and caramelise

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, melt 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whisk 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk gradually into the roux and cook for 5 min until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Once the sauce has thickened, remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir through half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) – this is your cheese sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have caramelised, add the chopped garlic, tomato paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, chopped tomatoes and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a pasta sauce consistency – this is your vegetable sauce

Chop your basil stalks (save the leaves for garnish!) and add them to the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Layer some of the vegetable sauce over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with half of your lasagne sheets

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Finally top with the cheese sauce, making sure all of the lasagne is covered

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese directly over the cheese sauce and put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the lasagne is cooked – this is your Mediterranean-style vegetable lasagne</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Allow the Mediterranean-style vegetable lasagne to cool slightly before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Tear the basil leaves

Serve the Mediterranean-style vegetable lasagne and garnish with the torn basil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
