<p><strong>Description:</strong> Paneer is a mild Indian cheese, similar in texture to halloumi, but without the saltiness. This fragrant curry combines slow cooked red pepper, red onion, ginger, garlic and Indian spices to create an unusual but sweet curry, tempered with coconut cream and fresh coriander. Served with lemongrass steamed basmati rice.</p>
