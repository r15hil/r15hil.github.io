<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to medium-high, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and slice through the thickest part of the chicken, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breast portion[s] to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of olive oil and your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your BBQ chicken

Mix it all together until fully coated and put it under the grill for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through and caramelised (no pink meat!)

While the chicken is grilling, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, drained sweetcorn, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), cornflour, egg[s] and<span class="text-danger"> </span>1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to a bowl and mix everything together

Crumble in your feta, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir to combine – this is your fritter mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 2 per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 4 min on one side then 2 min on the other until golden and cooked through – these are your spicy sweetcorn fritters</p><br><br>

<p>While the fritters are cooking, chop your chives finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine most of the chopped chives (save some for garnish!) with the mayo

Add a little splash of cold water to loosen and season with a crack of black pepper – this is your chive mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the tomato wedges and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the chicken in half, then layer a spicy sweetcorn fritter with a piece of BBQ chicken breast then a dollop of chive mayo and repeat the process again until you have a stack

Serve the BBQ chicken breast & spicy sweetcorn fritters stack with the dressed salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
