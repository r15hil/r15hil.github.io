<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your vegan mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl with half your honey and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)– this is your sweet & spicy mayo</p><br><br>

Add the chopped fable mushrooms and mix until fully combined

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until crisped and cooked through

Once cooked through, season with a generous pinch of salt – these are your popcorn Fable mushrooms</p><br><br>

Chop the lettuce into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the popcorn Fable mushrooms with the fries and sweet & spicy mayo to the side

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side, drizzle over the dressing and top with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
