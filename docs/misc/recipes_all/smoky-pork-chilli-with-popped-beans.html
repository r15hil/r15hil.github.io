<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240°C /220°C (fan) / gas 9 and boil a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, drain and rinse your red kidney beans (reserve the kidney bean liquid!)

Add half of the drained kidney beans (you'll use the rest later) to a baking tray (or two!)

Drizzle them with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the skins have burst and are crispy – these are your popped beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the kidney beans are in the oven, dissolve your beef stock mix in 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Add your ground cinnamon to the onion and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, increase the heat to high, then add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 2 min, then add the beef stock and a large pinch of sugar

Reduce the heat to medium-high, then cook for 10 min or until slightly thickened in consistency

Add the remaining kidney beans with the reserved kidney bean liquid and cook for a further 5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a chilli-like consistency and the meat has cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky pork chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chilli is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese

Once the rice is cooked, mix through the sliced spring onion and chopped coriander and season with a pinch of salt – this is your herby rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky pork chilli over the herby rice

Garnish with the popped beans and grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
