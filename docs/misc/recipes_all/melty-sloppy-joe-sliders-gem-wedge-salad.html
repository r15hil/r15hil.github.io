<p><strong>Description:</strong> An American institution, Sloppy Joes are a family favourite across the States. They're called sloppy for a reason (so napkins at the ready!), and are made even more delicious by melty mozzarella. These sliders are great to tear and share, but keep your eyes peeled for anyone trying to steal one of yours!</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once browned, top the brioche bottoms with the beef mixture (pile them high!) and torn mozzarella


Return the tray to the oven for 5-7 min or until the mozzarella is starting to melt


Once the mozzarella has started to melt, top with the brioche tops and return to the oven for 2-3 min further – these are your melty sloppy joe sliders</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, white wine vinegar and dried oregano in a small bowl – this is your creamy dressing


Cut the little gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways – these are your gem wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the melty sloppy joe sliders with gem wedges to the side


Drizzle the creamy dressing over the gem wedges


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
