<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)

Top, tail, peel then chop your parsnip[s] into bite-sized pieces

Crush your garlic (skins on) open by squashing them with the side of a knife</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel your potato[es] and chop into small cubes

Peel and chop half your apple[s] into small cubes (save the rest for later!)

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potato, chopped apple and thyme leaves (save some for garnish!) to a sheet of tin foil (or two!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water and scrunch it up to form a sealed parcel[s] and add it to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until everything is tender but not coloured – these are your softened vegetables

Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces and grate the cheddar cheese

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the sliced ciabatta to a separate baking tray and spread one side with butter and your cranberry sauce

Top with the torn mozzarella and grated cheese and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once all of the vegetables are tender, boil a kettle

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water

Remove the skins and roots from your onion and garlic and discard, then add them to a food processor with your vegetable stock and all of the softened vegetables

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>milk and whizz until smooth – this is your parsnip soup</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the parsnip soup to a pot over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Whilst the soup is warming, put the ciabatta in the oven for 5 min or until the ciabatta is crusty and the cheese has melted

Once done, sandwich the ciabatta together, then slice in half – these are your cheesy cranberry toasties

Whilst the toasties are in the oven, chop the remaining apple into matchsticks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the parsnip soup in bowls with the cheesy cranberry toasties to the side for dipping

Garnish the soup with the apple matchsticks, reserved thyme leaves, a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
