<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and half of your black sesame seeds (save the rest for later!)

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain your king prawns

Add the king prawns to the flour and mix them up until nicely coated (tap off any excess)

Add the floured prawns to the beaten egg, then add them to the sesame panko mix, pressing down firmly to coat them all over – these are your breaded prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the breaded prawns and cook for 2-3 min on each side, or until cooked through, golden and crispy – these are your crispy sesame prawns

Tip: Add a drizzle of extra oil if your pan is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the chilli mayo over the toasted brioche halves, top with the crispy sesame prawns and cucumber matchsticks – this is your Asian-style prawn burger

Serve with the sesame fries, any remaining chilli mayo and cucumber matchsticks to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
