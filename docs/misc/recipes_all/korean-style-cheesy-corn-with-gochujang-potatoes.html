<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 8-10 min, then drain and return to the pot with half your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mix it all together

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the diced pepper and grated cheese to a bowl with the chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the drained sweetcorn and half your mayo (you'll use the rest later) – this is your cheesy corn mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have steam dried, crush them lightly with a fork and then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Tip: You only want the potatoes lightly crushed, not mashed!

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until crispy – these are your gochujang potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
