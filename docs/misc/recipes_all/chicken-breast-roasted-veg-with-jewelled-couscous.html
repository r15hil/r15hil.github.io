<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper, red onion quarters, chopped courgette and chopped carrot to a large baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the veg is tender and starting to colour – this is your chunky roast veg

Peel and grate (or very finely chop) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast, chopped garlic, half your ras el hanout (you'll use the rest later!), and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Chop your dried cranberries finely

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water with your ground turmeric and remaining ras el hanout – this is your spiced stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped cranberries and couscous to a bowl with the spiced stock and give everything a good mix up

Cover the bowl, then set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat, then once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!)

Once toasted, chop the toasted almonds roughly (be careful they may be hot!)

Fluff the spiced couscous with a fork, then add your cider vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your jewelled couscous</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the chunky roast veg, spiced chicken breast and half the toasted almonds to the jewelled couscous and give everything a good mix – this is your chicken breast & roasted veg with jewelled couscous

Serve the chicken breast & roasted veg with jewelled couscous topped with the remaining toasted almonds and enjoy!</p><br><br>
