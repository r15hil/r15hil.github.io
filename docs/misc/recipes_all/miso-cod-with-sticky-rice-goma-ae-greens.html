<p><strong>Description:</strong> Miso is so much more than soup. You’ll use it to add delicious umami-rich flavour to caramelised grilled cod fillets. Drizzle homemade sesame dressing (known in Japan as ‘goma-ae’) over greens and a sprinkle of Japanese spice blend ‘shichimi togarashi’ for a peppery kick.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Pre-heat the grill to medium-high


Add the mirin, Chinese rice wine, soy sauce and rice vinegar to a bowl with the miso paste and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar 


Give everything a good mix up until the miso and sugar have dissolved – this is your miso marinade


Once dissolved, add the cod fillets to the bowl and set aside, turning over occasionally in the marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully


Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min


After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving - this is your sticky rice


Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with tin foil


Add the marinated cod fillets (save some marinade for later!) then put the tray under the grill and cook an initial 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise


Once caramelised, pour over the remaining marinade and return to the grill for 4-5 min further or until the marinade is golden and the fish is cooked through - this is your miso cod</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the cod is cooking, chop the green beans in half


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the halved green beans with a splash of water and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, add the spinach and cook for a further 2 min, covered, or until wilted 


Meanwhile, add the sesame seeds and the shichimi togarashi to a pestle &amp; mortar and crush until coarsely ground


Add the toasted sesame oil with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy sesame dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the green beans are cooked and the spinach is wilted, remove from the heat, then add the spicy sesame dressing and stir it all together – these are your goma-ae greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the miso cod (with any remaining marinade!) with the sticky rice and goma-ae greens to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
