<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan or wok (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 6 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>
