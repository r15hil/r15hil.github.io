<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Spread half the tomato sauce over the chicken breasts

Top with the grated cheese and torn mozzarella

Dollop the remaining tomato sauce over the top

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and all of the cheese has melted – this is your chicken parmigiana</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, tear the basil into a pestle & mortar (save a little for garnish) and grind to a paste

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!

Stir the mayo through the basil paste – this is your basil mayo</p><br><br>

Slice the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half

Add the halved ciabatta to a toaster (or the oven) for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once toasted, spread the ciabatta with the basil mayo and top with the chicken parmigiana and remaining torn basil

Serve the open chicken parmigiana sarnie with the fries and baby leaf salad to the side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper to the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
