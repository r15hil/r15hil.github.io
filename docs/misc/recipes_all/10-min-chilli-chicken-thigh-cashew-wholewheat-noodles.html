<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 3-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the noodles are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and diced chicken thigh and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the chopped spring onion and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After an initial 3-5 min, add the halved Tenderstem broccoli to the pot with the noodles and cook for 2 min further or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the noodles and Tenderstem and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>
