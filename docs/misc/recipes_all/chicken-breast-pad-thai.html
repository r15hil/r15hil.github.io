<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the chopped pepper to the pan[s]

Cook for a further 6-7 min or until the pepper is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
