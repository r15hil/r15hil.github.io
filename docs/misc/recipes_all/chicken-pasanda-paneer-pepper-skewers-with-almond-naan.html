<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Take a couple of knobs of butter out of the fridge to soften

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Soak the skewers in water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the paneer cubes to a large bowl with the chopped pepper, half the ginger & garlic paste (save the rest for later!) and a grind of black pepper – this is your marinated paneer & pepper

Thread the marinated paneer & pepper onto the soaked skewers and transfer them to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 13-15 min or until the paneer is slightly charred – these are your paneer & pepper skewers

Chop the chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chicken, the curry powder and the remaining ginger & garlic paste and cook for 2 min further or until fragrant

Add the chicken stock mix with half the ground almonds (you'll use the rest later!), 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water and a pinch of sugar and cook for 10-12 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the chicken is cooked through, add the cultured coconut – this is your creamy chicken pasanda</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining ground almonds and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with the softened butter and a pinch of salt – this is your almond butter mix

Spread the almond butter mix equally over the garlic & coriander naans, then transfer them to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until golden – these are your almond naans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the remaining sliced onion to a small bowl with half the rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar – this is your pink quick-pickled onion

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Add the chopped herbs to a small bowl with a drizzle of vegetable oil and the remaining rice vinegar – this is your herb chutney</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken pasanda over the basmati rice with the almond naans to the side

Serve the paneer & pepper skewers to the side and garnish with the pink quick-pickled onion and herb chutney

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
