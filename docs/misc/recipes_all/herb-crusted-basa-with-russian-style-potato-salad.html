<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg, then fill a bowl with very cold water, add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<p>Combine the chopped parsley with your panko breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – these are your parsley breadcrumbs

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over the parsley breadcrumbs then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your herb-crusted basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
