<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 4

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, cut the Tenderstem broccoli in half

Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> piece<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Lay the halved Tenderstem in the middle with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water and a pinch of salt and add to a baking tray

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the Tenderstem to form a sealed parcel

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon into thin slices (reserve for garnish!) and juice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon into a bowl

Add the honey, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> of the cornflour, half of the soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water to the bowl

Give it a good mix up - this is your lemon sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining cornflour with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour, 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> of the five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper in a large bowl

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining five-spice mix for another recipe!

Pour in the remaining soy sauce and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix until a thick batter remains

Slice the baby corn in half lengthways, then add to the batter along with the green beans and mix until evenly coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated veg (spread them out as much as possible) and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden – this is your crispy veg

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use two pans!

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the veg is cooking, wash, trim, then slice the spring onions finely

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, de-seed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Stir the sliced spring onions and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the cooked rice – this is your chilli rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the lemon sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce is thick and sticky</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy veg with the chilli rice and roasted Tenderstem to the side

Drizzle the lemon sauce over the crispy veg and garnish with the reserved lemon slices and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
