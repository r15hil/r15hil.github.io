<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Combine your beef mince, ground coriander and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape them into 6 koftas per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the koftas to one side of a baking tray (use baking paper to avoid mess!)

Add the onion wedges to the other side and drizzle with a little vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the koftas are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion is slightly charred – these are your spiced koftas and roasted onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the koftas are cooking, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Chop your tomato[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your cider vinegar in a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your natural yoghurt and harissa paste (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small bowl with a pinch of salt

Stir once or twice to swirl the harissa through the yoghurt – this is your harissa-marbled yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the koftas are almost done, add your tortillas to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the dressed salad evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with 2 spiced koftas and the roasted onion

Drizzle over the harissa-marbled yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
