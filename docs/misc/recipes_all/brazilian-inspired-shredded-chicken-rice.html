<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Transfer the browned chicken to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and reserve the pan

Boil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your arborio rice, chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further, stirring to coat the grains

Add the beef stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked with a slight bite – this is your spiced beef rice</p><br><br>

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
