<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Tear your chestnut mushrooms into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the torn mushrooms and halved Tenderstem and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, combine your peanut butter and soy sauce in a bowl with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of half the lime[s]

Add your toasted sesame oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water – this is your peanut sauce
