<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut narrow slices (about 1cm in width) into the butternut squash halves, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – this is your hasselback butternut squash

Transfer the hasselback butternut squash to a baking tray, cut side up and drizzle with vegetable oil

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 30 min or until the squash is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar cheese into a bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy breadcrumb mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add to a tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are in the oven, boil half a kettle

Peel and chop the red onions roughly

Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly into bite-sized pieces

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the squash has had an initial 30 min, remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb mix over the squash halves until they're totally covered

Return the tray to the oven for 10-15 min further, or until the breadcrumb mixture is starting to turn golden and the squash is tender – this is your cheesy baked squash

While the squash is in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped red onion, chopped courgette and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 4-5 min further or until all the veg has fully softened

Add the vegetable stock, season generously with salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your Mediterranean veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy baked squash over the Mediterranean veg with the roast potatoes to the side

Tear the basil over the Mediterranean veg

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
