<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to a baking tray, drizzle them with vegetable oil, then season with half of your smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a large pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25 min until crisp – these are your paprika wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potato wedges are cooking, trim, then finely chop your spring onion[s], separating the whites and greens

Combine your lean pork mince with the remaining smoked paprika and chopped spring onion whites in a bowl and season very generously with salt and pepper

Divide and shape into 1 patty per person and refrigerate until step 6 (this helps them hold their shape whilst cooking) – these are your paprika lean pork patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the pan is hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted

Once toasted, set aside until serving and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel your red onions, then slice into thin rings

Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the red onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onions have started to caramelise

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar, mayo, remaining sliced spring onion, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your salad dressing

Thinly slice your apple[s] (skin on), then add to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the paprika lean pork patties and cook, covered, for 6-7 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your gem lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and mix it all together – this is your apple salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, sandwich the paprika lean pork patties, caramelised onion rings and some apple salad between your toasted brioche halves – these are your paprika lean pork burgers

Serve the paprika wedges and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
