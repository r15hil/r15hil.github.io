<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once tender, add the drained linguine to the pan with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until the pasta is fully coated – this is your mushroom & asparagus linguine

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom & asparagus linguine with the salad to the side and season with a good grind of pepper

Add a small squeeze of lemon juice over the salad

Garnish with the toasted walnuts and a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
