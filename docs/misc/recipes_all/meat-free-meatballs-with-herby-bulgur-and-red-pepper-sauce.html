<h4>Step 1</h4>

Chop your chopped dates roughly, then add them to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside to soak</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Drain the soaked chopped dates, then add them to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Divide and shape the mixture into 5 meatballs per person, then refrigerate – these are your meat-free mince meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Lightly cover a baking tray (or two!) with olive oil (use kitchen paper to help you spread the oil out evenly!), then add the meat-free mince meatballs and put the tray[s] in the oven for 14-15 min or until they're cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once tender, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic to the softened pepper with your tomato paste and harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Cook for 2 min or until fragrant, then add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 6 min or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and a sauce has formed – this is your pepper sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While everything is cooking, pick your mint leaves from the stems and discard the stems

Chop the mint leaves finely (save some leaves for garnish!)

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped herbs to the drained bulgur wheat with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herby bulgur</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herby bulgur topped with a dollop of the pepper sauce and your natural yoghurt

Sprinkle your ground sumac over the yoghurt and top with the meat-free mince meatballs

Garnish with the reserved mint leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
