<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Drain any excess oil from the pan and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your shredded spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice

Add the shredded spring greens and sliced carrot to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, a splash of cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the vegetables to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray, put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until tender – these are your buttery vegetables</p><br><br>

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your roasted garlic mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lamb meatballs on top of the roasted garlic mash with the buttery vegetables to the side

Spoon over the balsamic onion gravy
