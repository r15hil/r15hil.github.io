<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] skin side up and cook for 4 min then, turn and top with the lemon rounds, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 4 min

Combine the chopped garlic and the juice of the remaining lemon[s] in a bowl with a large knob of butter

Season with salt and pepper – this is your lemon butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<p>Serve the lemon butter salmon with the tomato & spinach pesto rice to the side

Spoon over any excess lemon butter

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
