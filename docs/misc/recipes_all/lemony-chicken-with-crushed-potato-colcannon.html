<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the garlic,

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways and wash to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Add the whites of the sliced leek (save the greens for later!) with the sliced garlic and a pinch of a salt and cook for 4-5 min until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-10 min or until fork-tender, then drain in a sieve and set aside, reserving the pot for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, transfer everything from the pan to a plate and set aside for later

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Once the chicken is golden, return the leek & garlic mix to the pan and add the chicken stock

Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and chop into small pieces

Wash the shredded spring greens, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Chop the green beans into small pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add a knob of butter

Once hot, add the remaining leek with the spring greens, chopped green beans and a splash of water and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once tender, add the cooked potatoes with a large splash of milk

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and crush the potatoes gently with a potato masher – this is your crushed potato colcannon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to rest for 2 min before slicing

Return the sauce to a medium heat and add the chopped basil, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and a generous knob of butter and cook for 1-2 min further or until thickened – this is your lemony basil sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the crushed potato colcannon with the sliced chicken and lemony basil sauce to the side

Garnish with a grind of black pepper and a lemon wedge
