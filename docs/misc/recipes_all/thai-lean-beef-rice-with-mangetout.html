<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and sprinkle in your beef stock mix

Cook for 3-4 min or until the lean beef mince is browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<p>Add your mangetout to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your red Thai curry paste, ginger paste and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] into 2 wedges per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your tomato paste, a pinch of sugar and a small splash of water to the pan and mix until everything is combined

Squeeze your pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains then add to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir through half of the chopped basil and the juice of half the lime wedges (save the rest for garnish!)

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice is piping hot and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Thai-style lean beef mince rice with mangetout

Note: Please make sure you cook your beef thoroughly as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style lean beef mince rice with mangetout and garnish with the reserved chopped basil, a lime wedge and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
