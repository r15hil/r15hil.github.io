<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs with a large pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side until browned

Once browned, transfer them to a tin foil-lined baking tray (save the pan!) and put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, return the pan to a medium-high heat

Add the pepper strips and sliced onion with a big pinch of salt and sugar

Cook for 5 min, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 min further or until softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and your garlic, then finely chop (or grate) both

Bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the soft inner core[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml] </span>cold water and the outer lemongrass layers to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped lemongrass core, curry powder and most of your nigella seeds (save the rest for garnish!) to the onion pan and cook for 2 min

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the cooked chicken to the pan with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, the softened creamed coconut and the chicken stock mix

Mix well and cook, covered for a further 5 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, shred the cooked chicken apart in the pan using two forks and give everything a good mix – this is your shredded chicken thigh, pepper & lemongrass curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir half of the chopped coriander through the shredded chicken thigh, pepper & lemongrass curry and serve with the lemongrass rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and nigella seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
