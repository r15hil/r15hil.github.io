<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onions are cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!), ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 4-6 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Increase the heat to high, add the tomato stock and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your smoky meat-free mince filling

Grease an oven-proof dish with a little olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once thickened, divide the smoky meat-free mince filling between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and arrange them into the greased oven-proof dish

Top with the grated cheese and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until the tortillas are beginning to crisp and the cheese has melted – these are your smoky meat-free mince enchiladas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the enchiladas are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then stir it all together – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky meat-free mince enchiladas topped with the tomato salsa

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
