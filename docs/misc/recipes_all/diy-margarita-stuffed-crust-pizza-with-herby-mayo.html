<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine your tomato paste, half your dried oregano and 3/4 of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix and a pinch of salt to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 ball per person

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Roll out each dough ball into a circle disc the size of a dinner plate with a rolling pin – these are your pizza bases

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Dot a quarter of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>torn mozzarella (save the rest for later!) evenly around the edge of each pizza base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Roll the edge of the dough over the mozzarella and press to seal, forming a thick crust – these are your stuffed crust pizza bases</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and slide the stuffed crust pizza bases<span class="text-danger"> </span>onto the tray[s]

Add the tomato sauce onto each pizza and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon (be careful of the hot tray!)

Top them evenly with the remaining torn mozzarella and put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – these are your pizzas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are cooking, grate your Italian hard cheese

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a large bowl with your balsamic vinegar, half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and a small drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressed salad

Add your mayo to a small bowl with the remaining oregano, remaining grated garlic and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water – this is your herby mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese over the pizza and pick over your basil leaves, discarding the stems – this is your margherita stuffed crust pizza

Serve the margherita stuffed crust pizza with the herby mayo and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
