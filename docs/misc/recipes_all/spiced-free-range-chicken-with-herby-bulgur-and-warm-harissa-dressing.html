<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Top, tail then slice your courgette[s] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the pepper strips and courgette rounds to a baking tray (or two!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – this is your roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the veg is cooking, add your bulgur wheat and diced apricots to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to a separate plate with your ras el hanout and rub until fully coated – this is your spiced chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped parsley and mint (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked bulgur wheat and give it a good mix up

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and return the pan and any remaining juices to a low heat

Add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the pan and mix it all together

Squeeze in the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your warm harissa dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the free range spiced chicken finely and serve with the bulgur, roasted veg and shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the warm harissa dressing all over

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds and a lemon wedge, then sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
