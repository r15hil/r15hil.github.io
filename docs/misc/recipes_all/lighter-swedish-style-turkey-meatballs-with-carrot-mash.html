<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and slice the carrots finely

Add the chopped potato and sliced carrot to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam-dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the turkey mince with half the chicken stock mix (you'll use the rest later) and a generous pinch of pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined, then shape into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24]</span> meatballs

Reboil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min, turning occasionally, until they are browned on most sides

Meanwhile, combine the remaining chicken stock mix, Dijon mustard, soy sauce and redcurrant jelly in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Add the dried cranberries to a bowl and cover them with boiled water

Transfer the browned meatballs to a plate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a small knob of butter, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir until sandy

Whisk the stock into the flour

Cook for 2-3 min until the stock has thickened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce thickens, chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to the thickened sauce, return the browned meatballs to the pan

Cook, covered, for 6 min further or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – these are your Swedish-style turkey meatballs & gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Return the pot of drained potatoes and carrots to a low heat and add a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your carrot mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Drain the cranberries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Swedish-style turkey meatballs & gravy with the carrot mash and refreshed peas to the side

Garnish with the cranberries and remaining chopped dill

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
