<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] roughly

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger and peel and roughly chop your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly (like it hot? Keep the seeds in!)

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped onion, chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), your curry powder and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your spicy madras paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into large bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the spicy madras paste and the tomato wedges to the chicken and cook for 3-4 min further

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Add half of the chopped coriander to the sauce (save some for garnish!) and stir it all together – this is your hot chicken madras</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, cut your cucumber in half lengthways

Scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, then dice the cucumber

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Combine the diced cucumber and chopped mint in a small bowl with your cultured coconut and a pinch of salt – this is your cooling raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hot chicken madras over the basmati rice and dollop the cooling raita on top

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
