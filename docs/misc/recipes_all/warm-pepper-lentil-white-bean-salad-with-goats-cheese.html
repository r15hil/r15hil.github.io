<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Drain and rinse your green lentils and cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced peppers to the pan along with your roasted garlic paste and cook for 2-3 min or until the peppers are beginning to soften

Once soft, add the drained lentils & cannellini beans and cook for 1 min further or until everything is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of half your lemon wedge[s] with your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl – this is your zesty dressing

Add the zesty dressing to the pan with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your warm pepper, lentil & white bean salad

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warm pepper, lentil & white bean salad with the halved cherry tomatoes and salad over the top

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley, a lemon wedge and an extra drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over your goats' cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
