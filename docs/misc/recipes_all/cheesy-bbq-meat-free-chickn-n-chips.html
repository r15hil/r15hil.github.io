<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a grind of black pepper

Add your meat-free chick'n to the plate and turn them several times in the spices until they’re nicely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned meat-free chick'n to a tin foil-lined baking tray and scrunch the edges of the foil up a little around it

Tip: This will help to keep the sauce around your meat-free chick'n!

Drizzle your smoky BBQ sauce all over and put the tray in the oven for an initial 5 min</p><br><br>

<p>While everything's cooking, combine your white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

After 5 min, remove the meat-free chick'n tray from the oven and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Once everything is almost ready, add the salad, chopped tomato and cucumber rounds to the bowl of dressing and give everything a gentle mix</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy BBQ meat-free chick'n with the chips and salad to the side
