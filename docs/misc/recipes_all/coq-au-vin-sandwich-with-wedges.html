<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges and add the wedges to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of sugar

Cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once caramelised, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Add your red wine paste, half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce begins to thicken to a gravy-like consistency

Set aside to reheat later – this is your red wine gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened

Add the flattened chicken to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour, the remaining chicken stock mix and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to a separate bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour

Add the coated chicken to the bowl with the cornflour mix and give it a good mix up – this is your floured chicken

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the floured chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the sliced ciabatta

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges and wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add your roasted garlic paste and mayo to a bowl – this is your roast garlic aioli

Once everything is nearly ready, return the pot with the gravy to a medium heat and cook until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your sandwich, top each warmed ciabatta base with the roast garlic aioli, the fried chicken and some of the red wine gravy and then top with a warmed ciabatta lid

Serve the wedges and salad to the side with the tomato wedges and a little drizzle of olive oil

Pour the remaining gravy into a little pot, ready for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
