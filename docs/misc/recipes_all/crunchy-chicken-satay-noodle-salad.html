<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s], then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash, then cut your lettuce into thin wedges, lengthways, and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until they've softened slightly

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

Drain the soaked noodles and return to the large bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced chicken over the noodle salad

Drizzle the satay dressing over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
