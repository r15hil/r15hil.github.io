<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, until starting to brown and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your rice noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until tender with a slight bit

Once done, drain, stir through a drizzle of vegetable oil and set aside

Tip: The oil will stop the noodles from sticking together!</p><br><br>

<p>Add half your Marmite to a small bowl with your red chilli relish, peanut butter, soy sauce and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water and mix until combined – this is your Marmite satay sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pork mince has started to brown, cook for a further 4 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add your ginger & garlic paste and remaining Marmite to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until caramelised

Wash your spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pork has caramelised, add the spinach to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and cook, covered for 2 min until the spinach has started to wilt

Meanwhile, slice your spring onion[s] finely

Crush your peanuts with a rolling pin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has wilted, add the cooked rice noodles and Marmite satay sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are coated – these are your Marmite & peanut butter pork noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Marmite & peanut butter pork noodles in a bowl

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion and crushed peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
