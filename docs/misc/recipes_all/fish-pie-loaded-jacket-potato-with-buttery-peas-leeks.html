<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potato is in the microwave, chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potato[es] is cooked through, carefully slice in half (it will be very hot!) and scoop the potato flesh out into a bowl, leaving a little around the edges of the skin

Combine the potato flesh with your soft cheese, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash it all together – this is your creamy mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk your reserved poaching milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add the poached basa and chopped parsley to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper and gently stir until fully coated – this is your fish pie filling</p><br><br>

<p>Add your sliced leek to the middle of a large piece of tin foil with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>butter and a splash of cold water and mix everything together

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the leek to form a sealed parcel[s] and add it to a separate baking tray
