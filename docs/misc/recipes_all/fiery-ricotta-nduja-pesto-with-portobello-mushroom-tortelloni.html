<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic and 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, or until fragrant

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and add your soft cheese with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water and mix it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tortelloni to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy ‘Nduja & red pepper sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni

Tip: Add an extra splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy ‘Nduja & red pepper sauce with portobello mushroom tortelloni with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
