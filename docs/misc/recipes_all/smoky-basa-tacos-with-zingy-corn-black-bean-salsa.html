<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Add your ground smoked paprika and ground coriander to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add your basa fillet[s] to the spice blend and turn several times until fully coated in all the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] finely

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter), then cut into wedges

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the drained black beans to a bowl with the chopped tomato, sliced shallot, lime zest, a drizzle of olive oil and the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime wedges (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy black bean & tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Combine your mayo with your chipotle paste (can't handle heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your chipotle mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Tear the smoky basa into 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>pieces per person

Divide the shredded lettuce between the warmed tortillas and top with the smoky basa pieces, zingy black bean & tomato salsa and chipotle mayo – these are your smoky basa tacos with zingy black bean & tomato salsa

Garnish with the remaining lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
