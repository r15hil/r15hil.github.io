<p><strong>Description:</strong> Although this rich, spicy tomato and egg dish is said to have its origins in North Africa, it's now just as well known for its popularity as a breakfast option across Israel. The crispy 'feta-dillas' with gooey centres make excellent soldiers. Verdict: a quick, wholesome dish that delivers bundles of flavour!</p>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a pan over a medium-high heat


Add a feta-dilla sandwich to the pan and cook&nbsp;for 2-4 min or until slightly brown and crispy


Carefully flip the feta-dilla with a spatula&nbsp;(you might need to use your hand&nbsp;for extra&nbsp;support!) and cook for another 2-4 min on the other side


Place them in the oven to keep warm while you repeat the process with the remaining&nbsp;feta-dillas&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, use a spoon to make 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> grooves in the tomato-bean mix


Crack an egg into each groove and season with salt and pepper


Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-5 <span class="text-highlight">min</span> or until the eggs are cooked&nbsp;to your liking &ndash; this is your Shakshuka


Tip: if you like your eggs runny, cook for 1-2 min and then turn the heat off but leave the lid on until ready to serve&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the crispy feta-dillas into triangles


Sprinkle the remaining parsley over the Shakshuka


Place&nbsp;the pan&nbsp;and feta-dillas in the middle of the table and dig in!


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
