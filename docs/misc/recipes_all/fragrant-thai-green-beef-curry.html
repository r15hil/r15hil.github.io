<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Chop the coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Add the ginger, garlic, half of the red chilli (save the rest for later) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry paste</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min

Once the shallot has softened, add the beef strips and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
