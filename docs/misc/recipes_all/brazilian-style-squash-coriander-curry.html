<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your coriander seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the coriander seeds to a pestle & mortar and crush roughly

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, peanut butter and chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[460ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Increase the heat to medium, add your cherry tomatoes and coconut stock and cook for 7-9 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish!)

Add the roasted butternut squash and chopped coriander to the pan and cook for 1 min further – this is your Brazilian-style squash & coriander curry

Add the juice of half your lime[s] to the curry

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Brazilian-style squash & coriander curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
