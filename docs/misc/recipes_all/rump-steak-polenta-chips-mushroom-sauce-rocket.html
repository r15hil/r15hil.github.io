<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Get prepared and cook your polenta 


Boil a kettle 


Line a <span class="text-highlight">small</span> <span class="text-highlight">oven-proof dish</span> or tupperware (approx 15x15cm) with cling film<span class="text-highlight"> and set it to one side</span>.


Add 400ml<span class="text-danger"> [800ml]</span> boiled water to a pot with the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and bring to the boil over a high heat.


Once dissolved, gradually whisk the polenta into the boiling stock. Continue to whisk for 2-3 minutes or until a thick porridge consistency is achieved.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Finish your polenta chip prep


Once the polenta has thickened, add the grated Italian hard cheese and a large knob of butter and whisk until fully combined.


Pour the polenta into the baking dish and quickly smooth the surface with an oiled spatula.


Put the dish in the fridge for 20 minutes or until the polenta is set.


Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 210°C/ 190°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 6.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Make your balsamic dressing


Peel and chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely. 


Add the chopped shallot, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>  sugar with a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a small bowl.


Whisk thoroughly with a fork until fully combined.


Use the next 10 minutes to set the table, wash up or simply chill.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Finishing preparing your polenta chips


Once set, turn the polenta out onto a chopping board and, using a sharp knife, slice it very carefully into 1.5-2cm thick chips.


Gently add the polenta chips to an oiled baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt.


Put the tray in the oven for 35 minutes or until the polenta chips are brown and crispy.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Get prepared for the last few steps


Re-boil a kettle. 


Tear the chestnut mushrooms into small bite-sized pieces.


Slice the baby plum tomatoes in half.


Chop the chives finely and set aside.


Pat the rump steaks dry with a kitchen towel, rub them with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cook your steaks


Heat a large, wide-<span class="text-highlight">based pan (preferably non-stick) over</span> a high heat and once very hot, add the steaks. 


For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. For medium, cook for 3-4 minutes on each side. For rare, cook for 2 minutes max on each side.


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">To get a lovely caramelisation, don’t move the</span> steaks around too much in the pan – this will stop them from browning.


Once cooked, transfer the steaks to a chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest in a warm place.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Make your mushroom sauce


Whilst your steaks are resting, return the pan to a medium heat (no need to clean it!) with a splash of water to loosen any meat juices in the pan.


Add the mushrooms with a knob of butter and cook for 4-5 minutes or until crisp, then add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 minute.


Add the Chinese rice wine, soy sauce, soft cheese and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 2-3 minutes or until thickened. Then add the chives, a generous grind of pepper and any steak juices and cook for 1 minute further – this is your mushroom sauce.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Toss the rocket and baby plum tomatoes with the <span class="text-highlight">balsamic</span> dressing and serve to the side in separate bowls.


Season the rested steak with salt and pepper.


Serve the steak over the mushroom sauce with the polenta chips to the side.


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
