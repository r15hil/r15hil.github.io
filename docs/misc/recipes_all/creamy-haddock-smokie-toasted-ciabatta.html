<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Melt 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter in a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk and your double cream into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 3-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Once the potatoes are tender, add the chopped haddock bites, cooked potatoes and chopped tomato to the béchamel sauce

Add a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your haddock filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the haddock filling to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with the grated cheese and a grind of pepper

Put the dish[es] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until bubbling and golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your haddock smokie

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Once the haddock smokie is ready, remove the dish[es] from the oven and top with your smoked sea salt flakes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the haddock smokie with the toasted ciabatta to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
