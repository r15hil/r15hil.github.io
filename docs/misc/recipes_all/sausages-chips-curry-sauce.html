<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your Marmite and 60ml <span class="text-purple">[90ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> very cold water in a small bowl, stirring continuously until fully combined – this is your Marmite stock

Soak your skewer[s] in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g] </span><span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour and 3/4 of your cornflour (save the rest for later!) to a large bowl with your red wine vinegar and the Marmite stock

Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no lumps, then set aside – this is your batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Pat your hot dog sausage[s] dry with kitchen paper and sprinkle all over with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

Thread the floured hot dog sausage[s] onto your soaked skewer[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, dip the floured sausage[s] into the batter and turn several times until fully coated, then add the coated sausage[s] to the pan and cook for 15-17 min, turning occasionally, or until cooked through, golden and crispy (no pink meat!) – this is your battered sausage

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Once everything is almost ready, combine the remaining cornflour and soy sauce in a small bowl with your ginger & garlic paste, ground turmeric, curry powder and a pinch of sugar

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up, then put the bowl in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring halfway – this is your curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter

Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your mushy peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the skewer[s] from the battered sausage[s] and serve with the chips and mushy peas to the side

Serve the curry sauce in a pot to the side for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
