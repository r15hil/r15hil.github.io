<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped sweet potato to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is cooked and golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the sweet potato is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[800ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cooked chicken breast</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and chopped ginger and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Rinse your red lentils, then add them to the pan with the vegetable stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the lentils are cooked and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander roughly including the stalks, keeping the stalks separate from the leaves

Chop your lime[s] in half

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the lentils are cooked, add the shredded kale to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 3-5 min or until the kale has wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the kale has wilted, add your peanut butter with the chopped coriander stalks (save the chopped leaves for garnish!) and the juice of half the lime[s] and stir it all together – this is your satay kale curry

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted sweet potato over the satay kale curry

Finish with a dollop of natural yoghurt

Garnish with the chopped coriander leaves, roasted peanuts and a lime wedge

Serve the cooked chicken breast to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
