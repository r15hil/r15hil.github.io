<p><strong>Description:</strong> Pesto is our go-to sauce for fresh fast food. It takes mere minutes to make, and transforms pasta in an instant. This pesto is made from rocket, which has an earthy bitterness that's offset by the sweetness of walnuts and saltiness of garlic and cheese.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a dry wide based pan (large enough to fit the cooked pasta in) on a medium low heat

When hot, add the walnuts and toast for 3-5 min, moving them about the pan occasionally so they colour evenly

Once toasted, remove them from the heat and reserve the pan for step 7</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pasta with the remaining rocket and Parmesan shavings over the top and an extra drizzle of olive oil (if desired)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
