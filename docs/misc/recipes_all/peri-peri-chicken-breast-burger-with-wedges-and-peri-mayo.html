<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced onion to a small bowl with your red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and a splash of boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Season the flattened chicken with half your peri-peri seasoning (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken breast</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the outer leaves and set aside, then shred the inner core</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining peri-peri seasoning (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your mayo in a small bowl – this is your peri mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the wedges are nearly done, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved brioche, cut side up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min further or until toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the quick-pickled onion and reserve the pickling liquid

Add half the quick-pickled onion (you'll use the rest later!) and the reserved pickling liquid to a bowl with the shredded lettuce and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your pickled onion salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, top the toasted brioche base with a lettuce leaf, the sliced tomato, the remaining quick-pickled onion, peri peri chicken breast, some of the peri mayo and top with a toasted brioche lid – this is your peri peri chicken burger

Serve the wedges, pickled onion salad and any remaining peri mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
