<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat your grill to a high heat

Add your basmati rice, nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your nigella rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the rice from the heat and keep covered until serving

Cut your basa fillet[s] in half lengthways, and then chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) with your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a generous pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl

Add the chopped basa pieces and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your coated basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil and drizzle with olive oil (to prevent the fish from sticking!)

Add the coated basa to the baking tray[s] and place under the grill for 6-7 min or until the fish is cooked through and starting to char – this is your tandoori basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways

Scrape the inner seeds out of the cucumber using a teaspoon and set aside for later, then dice the rest

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Dice your tomato[es]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the diced cucumber, chopped shallot and diced tomato with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your kachumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the cucumber seeds, remaining natural yoghurt and mint sauce in a bowl

Season with a large pinch of salt – this is your mint raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tandoori basa over the nigella rice with the kachumber salad and mint raita to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
