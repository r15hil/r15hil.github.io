<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and once hot, roughly crumble your chestnut mushrooms directly into the pan

Cook over a high heat for 3-5 min or until starting to brown and caramelise – these are your caramelised mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the caramelised mushrooms to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put in the oven to keep warm

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly and chop your chives finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced spring onion and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan with a knob of butter

Cook for 30 secs or until softened

Add your arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the butter

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until it's evaporated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once evaporated, reduce the heat to medium, add your vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice and chicken are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheese and clotted cream

Remove the caramelised mushrooms from the oven and add half to the pan (save the other half for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy chicken breast, mushroom & chive risotto

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if your risotto is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken breast, mushroom & chive risotto topped with the remaining caramelised mushrooms

Garnish with a sprinkle of the remaining chopped chives and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
