<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chips to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-8 min or until part-cooked

Meanwhile, add the shredded red cabbage to a large bowl with half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up

Set aside until serving – this is your pickled red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chips have dried, add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to the chips and season with a generous pinch of salt then give everything a good mix up

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 8 min, add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return the tray to the oven for 2-4 min or until the bread is lightly toasted and the burgers are cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Build your burger by topping the base with some pickled red cabbage, a vegan patty, some chunky chips, a drizzle of the Belgian Hellmann's mayo and the lid

Serve with the remaining chunky chips, pickled cabbage and Belgian Hellmann's mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
