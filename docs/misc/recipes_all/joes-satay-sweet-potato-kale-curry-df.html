<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, separate the coriander leaves from the stalks, then chop the coriander stalks roughly (save the leaves for garnish!)

Chop the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Wash the shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the lentils are cooked, add the shredded kale to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 3-5 min or until the kale has wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the kale has wilted, add the peanut butter with the chopped coriander stalks and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and stir it all together – this is your satay kale curry

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Finish with a dollop of coconut yoghurt

Garnish with the coriander leaves, roasted peanuts and a lime wedge
