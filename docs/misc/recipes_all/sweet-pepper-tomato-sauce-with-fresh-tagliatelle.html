<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet pepper & tomato tagliatelle topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Garnish with the chopped basil and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
