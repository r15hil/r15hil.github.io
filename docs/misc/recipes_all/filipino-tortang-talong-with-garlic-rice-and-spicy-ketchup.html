<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and add the cut aubergine, flesh side down

Drizzle with vegetable oil and put the tray[s] into the oven for 25-30 min or until the aubergine is cooked through and soft</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your sriracha (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato ketchup and half of your tamari soy sauce with a splash of cold water and a pinch of sugar – this is your spicy ketchup</p><br><br>

<p>Crack your egg[s] into a large bowl with your vegetable stock mix and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once your aubergine has had an initial 15 min, add the chopped garlic with a drizzle of vegetable oil to a medium pot with a lid and fry for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add your white long grain rice with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat then reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove from the heat, add your mangetout to the same pot (over the rice) and put the lid back on for 3 min or until the mangetout are hot and tender but with a slight crunch – this is your garlic rice & mangetout</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once your aubergine is cooked through and softened, flatten with a plate by pressing down firmly on top of the roasted aubergine

Drizzle the remaining tamari soy sauce on the flattened aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your flattened aubergine, skin-side down and then pour in your egg mixture

Cook, covered for 3-4 min or until the egg has cooked through – this is your Filipino tortang talong

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Filipino tortang talong with the garlic rice & mangetout to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and the sliced spring onion

Drizzle over the spicy ketchup

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
