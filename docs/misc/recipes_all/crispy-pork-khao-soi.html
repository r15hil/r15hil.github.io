<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced red pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min

Add 3/4 of the sliced red onion (save the rest for later!) and cook further for 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the Thai red curry paste and cook for a further 1-2 min – this is your khao soi base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly

Combine the chopped coconut cream with 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water, fish sauce, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime, and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>of sugar

Stir it all together until everything has dissolved – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock to the khao soi base and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, season with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-8 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your khao soi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pork mince to the pan, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-10 min or until golden and crisp - this is your crispy pork

Meanwhile, pick the coriander leaves from their stalks, discard the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the fine egg noodles to a pot, cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until tender, then drain

Once drained, add the cooked noodles to the khao soi

Add the remaining sliced red onion to a bowl and squeeze over the juice from the remaining lime</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Bash the roasted peanuts with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

Serve the khao soi in bowls, topped with the crispy pork, sliced red onion, coriander leaves and crushed peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
