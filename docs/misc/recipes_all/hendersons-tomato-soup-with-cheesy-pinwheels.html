<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Grate your Italian hard cheese finely

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Spread your tomato paste evenly over the pastry with the back of a spoon, leaving a 1cm border around the edge

Sprinkle your dried thyme and half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) all over with a pinch of salt and top with the torn mozzarella</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Roll the pastry sheet up to form a log shape, as tightly as possible

Cut into 3 slices per person, approx. 1 inch thick – these are your pinwheel slices

Add the pinwheel slices to the lined baking tray[s], filling side up, and put in the oven for 15-17 min or until golden, oozy and cooked through – these are your cheesy pinwheels</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have slightly softened, add the stock, finely chopped tomatoes and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar to the pot with a generous pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 11-12 min or until slightly thickened

Once slightly thickened, remove the pot from the heat and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your tomato soup</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato soup topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, a generous grind of black pepper and drizzle over your Henderson's Relish – this is your Henderson's tomato soup

Tip: Not a fan of Henderson's? Just add a little!

Serve the cheesy pinwheels to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
