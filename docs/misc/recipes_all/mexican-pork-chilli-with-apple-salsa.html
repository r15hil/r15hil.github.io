<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the diced red onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt, then cook for 5 min or until softened and starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining diced red onion to a medium-sized bowl with a pinch of salt and the red wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Stir the ground allspice into the softened onion and cook for 1 min

Add the pork mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, dissolve the beef stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mince has browned, stir in the tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add the beef stock and reduce the heat to medium-low

Cook for 10-15 min or until thick and reduced to a chilli-like consistency – this is your Mexican-style pork chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the diced apple to the quick-pickled red onion with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper – this is your apple salsa

Fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style pork chilli over the fluffed bulgur with the apple salsa to the side

Top with the grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
