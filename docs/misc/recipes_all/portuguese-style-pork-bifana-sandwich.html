<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your pork loin steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until caramelised

Once done, transfer the caramelised onions to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic, ground paprika, white wine vinegar, bay leaf[ves] and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your spicy marinade</p><br><br>

Slice the pork loin steaks finely

Add the sliced pork to the spicy marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are almost cooked, add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until they're hot and crusty

Once done, carefully cut them in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated pork and any remaining marinade from the bowl and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs further, stirring until the pork is coated in the sauce – this is your Portuguese-style spicy pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the sweet mustard mayo over the warmed ciabattas and top with the Portuguese-style spicy pork and caramelised onions - this is your Portuguese-style spicy pork bifana sandwich

Serve the chips and salad to the side

Tip: Don't forget to remove the bay leaf[ves]!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
