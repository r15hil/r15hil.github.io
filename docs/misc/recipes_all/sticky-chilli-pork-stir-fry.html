<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5-6 min or until browned and crisped, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>
