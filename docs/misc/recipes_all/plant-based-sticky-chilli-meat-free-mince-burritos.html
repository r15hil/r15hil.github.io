<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mince is cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free mince is browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your agave and cook for 2-3 min or until the meat-free mince becomes crispy and sticky – this is your sticky chilli meat-free mince</p><br><br>

Drizzle over the lime mayo, then roll your burritos up tightly

Garnish with a lime wedge
