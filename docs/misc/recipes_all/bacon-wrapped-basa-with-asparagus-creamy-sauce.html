<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 8-10 min or until just tender, then drain, reserving the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cooked potatoes to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 5 min

Meanwhile, wrap your basa fillet[s] in your smoked streaky bacon – this is your bacon wrapped basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 5 min, transfer the bacon wrapped basa to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15-20 min further or until the bacon is crispy and the fish is cooked through – this is your bacon wrapped basa and roasted potatoes

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, reboil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your garlic

Chop your dill & chive mix finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chicken stock, soft cheese and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up, then cook for 3-4 min or until slightly reduced

Once reduced, add the juice of half your lemon[s] and the chopped dill & chives – this is your creamy lemon & herb sauce

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim your green beans

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Add the trimmed green beans and asparagus to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bacon wrapped basa with the roasted potatoes and the cooked green beans & asparagus to the side

Drizzle the creamy lemon & herb sauce over everything

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
