<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a separate pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion and cabbage have softened, add half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot, cook for a further 30 secs then set aside to cool

Combine your mayo and Dijon mustard in a separate bowl – this is your mustard mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your pork sausage[s] to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sausage[s] is cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min, stirring occasionally, or until golden and crisp

Once golden, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 30 secs or until fragrant – these are your sauteed potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the remaining cider vinegar to the cooled cabbage with a grind of black pepper and half the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your sauerkraut

Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun

Remove the tray with the sausage[s] from the oven

Add the cut hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the tray, then return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each warmed hot dog bun with some mustard mayo, a sausage and some sauerkraut

Serve the sauteed potatoes to the side with the remaining sauerkraut and remaining mustard mayo

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
