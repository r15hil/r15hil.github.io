<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the burgers have 2 min left, top with the grated cheddar and put back into the oven until the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy patties</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble the burgers, spread each brioche slice with the Dijon mustard

Layer up your burger with the sliced beetroot and onion, a cheesy patty and fried egg, and a handful of the reserved lamb's lettuce

Top with the brioche lid, then skewer the burger

Serve with the sweet potato fries, salad and remaining mayonnaise

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
