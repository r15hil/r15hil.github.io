Season the chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper


Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 3 min, turning halfway until just golden, then&nbsp;transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had 15 min oven-time, remove the dish from the oven and place the mozzarella slices over each piece of chicken


Sprinkle the remaining oregano over the mozzarella slices


Put the dish back into the oven for 5 min or until the mozzarella has melted and the chicken is cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the melty mozzarella chicken with the crispy potatoes and green beans to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
