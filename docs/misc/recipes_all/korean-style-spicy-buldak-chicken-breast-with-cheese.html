<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate into petals

Peel and finely chop your garlic and peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop your ginger

Add the onion petals, garlic and ginger to a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)

Tip: Keep the pan off the heat for now!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken breast to the pan with your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), soy sauce, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the pan to a high heat and once hot, cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant and the chicken is starting to brown

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened

Tip: If the sauce is a little thin, remove the lid and cook over a high heat for 2-3 min further until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, pre-heat the grill to medium-high

Trim and cut your green beans in half

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your toasted sesame oil and halved green beans and cook for 6-7 min or until tender

Once done, sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the green beans are cooking, drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper

Tear the mozzarella over the cooked chicken and put the pan under the grill for 4-5 min or until golden and melted – this is your Korean-style spicy buldak chicken breast with cheese

Tip: Watch out for your hot pan handle! If your pan isn't oven-proof, transfer it to an oven-proof dish instead

Trim, then finely slice the spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Korean-style spicy buldak chicken breast with cheese in a bowl with the sesame green beans and sticky rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
