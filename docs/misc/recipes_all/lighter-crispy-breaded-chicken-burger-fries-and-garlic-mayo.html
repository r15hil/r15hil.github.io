<h4>Step 1</h4>

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is nearly cooked, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the warmed brioche buns with the garlic mayo, then add the shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and crispy breaded chicken

Serve the fries, diced tomato and remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the dressing over the salad
