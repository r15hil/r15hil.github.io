<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into wedges

Add the sweet potato wedges to a tray (or two!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sweet potato wedges are cooking, cut your lemon[s] in half

Combine the juice of half your lemon[s] with your wholegrain mustard, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your mustard dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat 

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg

Once done, drain and refill the pot with ice cold water, add the cooked egg[s] then set them aside to cool

Tip: Use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, add the shredded kale with a pinch of salt, then return the pan to the heat and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to soften

Tip: Cover the pan with a lid to help the kale wilt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the kale is starting to soften, add the spinach with the chopped garlic and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the kale is tender and the spinach is starting to wilt – these are your garlic greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato wedges have had 15 min, remove them from the oven and push to one side of the tray[s]

Add your pumpkin seeds to the other side of the tray[s] and drizzle over your tamari soy sauce

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-7 min until the sweet potato is cooked through and golden and the seeds are toasted – these are your tamari-roasted seeds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel the cooled boiled egg[s] and cut them in half

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet potato wedges with the garlic greens, sliced avocado, boiled egg halves and lemon wedge to the side

Drizzle over the mustard dressing and sprinkle with the tamari-roasted seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
