<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and sliced pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min or until the pepper has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant, then add the drained black beans, sweetcorn and vegetable stock

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!) and add to a baking tray – this is your bean parcel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add a knob of butter and a splash of milk to the potatoes and mash until smooth, then stir through the sliced spring onion and a pinch of salt – this is your spring onion mash

Top the pie filling with the spring onion mash and grated cheeze, put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through and the top has lightly browned – this is your cheezy plant-based Mexican-Style pie

Add the bean parcel to the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheezy plant-based Mexican-Style pie with the green beans to the side

Tip: Drizzle over any remaining juices from the foil parcel!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
