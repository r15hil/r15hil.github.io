<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced onion, chicken breast strips and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Cook for 3-4 min on each side or until the chicken is golden

Once golden, add your curry powder, chicken stock mix and a couple of splashes of water and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the puff pastry into 1 rectangle per person and add the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with the onion, season generously with salt and pepper then give it a good mix up – this is your pulled curry chicken

Divide the pulled curry chicken between the pastry, covering only one half of the rectangle[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together then use a fork to crimp along the join and prick air holes all over

Brush the pastry with a little milk and top with half your nigella seeds (you'll use the rest later!), then put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-20 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your chicken curry pasty[ies]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your mango chutney, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo in a small bowl – this is your mango-sriracha dip</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, drizzle a little olive oil over the salad and sprinkle over the remaining nigella seeds

Serve the chicken curry pasty with the chips, salad and mango-sriracha dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
