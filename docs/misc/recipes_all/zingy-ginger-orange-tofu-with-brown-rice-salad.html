<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Peel and grate your garlic

Cut your orange[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the grated ginger, grated garlic, soy sauce and the juice of the orange[s] in a bowl — this is your zingy ginger & orange dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu, pat it dry with kitchen paper and cut into strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the tofu strips and 1/3 of the zingy ginger & orange dressing (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp – this is your zingy ginger & orange tofu</p><br><br>

<p>Add your toasted sesame oil and cider vinegar to the remaining zingy ginger & orange dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the tofu is cooking, top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Chop the root[s] off your lettuce and discard

Separate the leaves, then wash and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber into discs, then slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Add your blanched edamame beans and cucumber matchsticks to the brown rice with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up — this is your edamame brown rice salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the zingy ginger & orange tofu over the edamame brown rice salad with the lettuce leaves and carrot ribbons to the side

Drizzle the reserved zingy ginger & orange dressing all over

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
