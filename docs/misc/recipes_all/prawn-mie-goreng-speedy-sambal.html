<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the carrot strips and cook for 2 min

Add the shredded kale and cook for 1 min further, then add a very small splash of cold water and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables are tender, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with 2/3 of the speedy sambal (save the rest for later!)

Add your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil and cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the cooked noodles and add them to the pan with the prawns and vegetables

Gently stir everything together for 1-2 min or until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce – this is your king prawn mie goreng</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the king prawn mie goreng with the remaining speedy sambal drizzled all over the top

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
