<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste with your curry powder and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

Pat your cod fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the drained lentils to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until everything is combined

Chop<span class="text-danger"> </span>your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the coconut stock to the pan along with your spinach and cook for 3-4 min or until all the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened – these are your curried lentils</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your ground turmeric and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cod fillet[s] to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your turmeric cod

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the cod is cooking, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with your nigella seeds, your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled carrot</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried lentils with the turmeric cod over the top

Top with the quick-pickled carrot

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
