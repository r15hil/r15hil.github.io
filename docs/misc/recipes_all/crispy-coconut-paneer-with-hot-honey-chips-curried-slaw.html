<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your spiced chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, add your coconut flakes to a food processor and grind to a fine powder

Tip: No food processor? Bash the coconut flakes in a pestle & mortar into a fine powder!

Combine the ground coconut and cornflour on a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Season the cubed paneer with a pinch of salt, then drizzle with a little vegetable oil and press them into the ground coconut mix firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your coated paneer</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated paneer and cook for 5-6 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the paneer is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt, rice vinegar and remaining curry powder in a large bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar and mix it all together – this is your curried dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your mooli slaw mix and chopped coriander to the curried dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your curried slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the paneer is golden, remove the pan from the heat and add your honey and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your crispy coconut paneer</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy coconut paneer with the curried slaw and spiced chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
