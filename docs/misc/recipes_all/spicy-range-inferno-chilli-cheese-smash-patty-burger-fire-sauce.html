<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Wash then remove 1 outer leaf per person from your lettuce and set aside, then cut the inner core into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Cook for 1-2 min or until the butter starts to brown

Once the butter has begun to brown, add a little drizzle of vegetable oil, half your chilli flakes (you'll use the rest later!) and your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until very fragrant – this is your chilli brown butter

Once fragrant, transfer the chilli brown butter to a small heatproof bowl and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Divide your beef mince into 2 pieces per person, shape into meatballs and transfer them to a clean chopping board with a handful of flour, then cover the meatballs with a sheet of baking paper and roll them out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your patties

Set aside the baking paper and top the patties with the sliced chilli, the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then recover with the reserved baking paper and roll until the chilli is pressed into the patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties (chilli-side down!)

Press them down very firmly with a spatula and cook for 3-4 min on one side, pressing down continuously, until slightly charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once slightly charred, flip the patties over and top with grated cheese and cook, covered, for a final 4-5 min or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chilli smash patties

Meanwhile, combine the chilli brown butter with your mayo, half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your fire sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray[s] with the wedges from the oven and place the brioche halves (cut side up!) on top of the wedges

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build the burger, top the warmed brioche base with an outer lettuce leaf, 2 chilli cheese smash patties, a generous dollop of the fire sauce and a warmed brioche lid – this is your inferno chilli cheese smash patty burger

Serve the lettuce wedges and drizzle over the remaining vinegar and a little drizzle of olive oil with the potato wedges and any remaining fire sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
