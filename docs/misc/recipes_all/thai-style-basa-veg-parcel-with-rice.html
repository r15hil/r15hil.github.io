<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slightly scrunch the edges of the paper around the filling and then add the Thai curry stock evenly between each parcel

Scrunch the edges of the baking paper together around the fish to form a sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 17 min or until the fish is cooked through and the veg has softened – this is your Thai-style basa & veg

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style basa & veg with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
