<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat
