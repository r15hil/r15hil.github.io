<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked


Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed</p><br><br>
