<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and give it a good mix up – this is your creamy stock

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a very small drizzle of olive oil

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the creamy stock to the pan with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your creamy tomato sauce

Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your gnocchi (this will cook in the oven later!)

Transfer the contents of the pan to an oven-proof dish and top with the torn mozzarella</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your creamy tomato gnocchi bake

Put the tray with the Tenderstem broccoli parcel[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once the Tenderstem broccoli is done, mix through your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your chilli Tenderstem

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the chilli!</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato gnocchi bake with the chilli Tenderstem to the side

Tip: For a bit of extra indulgence, add a knob of butter to the Tenderstem!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
