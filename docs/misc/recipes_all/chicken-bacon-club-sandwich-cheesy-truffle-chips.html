<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are in the oven, chop your smoked streaky bacon in half

Add your chicken breast portion[s] and chopped bacon to a separate baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the bacon is crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken and bacon are cooking, slice your tomato[es] finely

Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper, then tear off 2 outer leaves per person and chop them in half

Chop the remaining lettuce into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) with your mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your mustard mayo

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and roughly shred using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are golden, sprinkle the grated cheese over the top and return to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted

Once done, drizzle the cheesy chips with most of your truffle oil (save some for dipping) – these are your cheesy truffle chips

Slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, fill the warmed ciabatta with some mustard mayo, halved lettuce leaves, sliced tomato, pulled chicken, smashed avocado and crispy bacon – this is your chicken & bacon club sandwich

Using a serrated knife, slice the sandwich in half into triangles then skewer together

Serve the chicken & bacon club sandwich with the cheesy truffle chips, lettuce wedges and remaining truffle oil to the side for dipping and enjoy!</p><br><br>
