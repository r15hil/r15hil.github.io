<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your basa fillet[s] in half lengthways

Slice each half into 3 pieces (roughly the size and shape of fish fingers) so that you are left with 6 fish fingers per person

Add your curry powder and a pinch of salt to a plate with the fish fingers and coat them in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a separate plate

Crack your egg[s] into a bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat the fish fingers in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the beaten egg, finally press them firmly into the breadcrumbs until evenly coated

Add the breaded fish fingers to a plate and pop them in the fridge until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain, set aside and reserve the pot for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your mango chutney in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion[s] with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the sliced garlic, drained potatoes, your ground turmeric, garam masala and nigella seeds and cook for 7-8 min or until crisp and golden – these are your masala potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Rub a little vegetable oil onto a baking tray (this stops the fish from sticking!)

Add the breaded fish fingers to the oiled tray

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the fish is golden, crispy and cooked through – these are your Indian-spiced fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your blanched peas to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until tender

Once tender, drain the peas and return them to the pot over a low heat

Add a knob of butter and cook for 1 min further or until melted – these are your buttery peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indian-spiced fish fingers with the masala potatoes, buttery peas and mango mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
