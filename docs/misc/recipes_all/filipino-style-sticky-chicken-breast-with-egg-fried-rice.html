<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then transfer the cooked rice to a plate, reserving the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cut the remaining brown onion into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine 2/3 of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and your rice vinegar in a bowl with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar<span class="text-danger"> </span>and 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water – this is your Filipino-style tocino sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the onion wedges and cornflour to the pan with half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up until the cornflour has been absorbed by any juices

Add the Filipino-style tocino sauce and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Filipino-style sticky chicken breast</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add the remaining chopped garlic and remaining soy sauce to the pan with the cooked rice and blanched peas

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once warmed through, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>onto the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your garlic & egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Filipino-style sticky chicken breast over the garlic & egg fried rice

Spoon any remaining Filipino-style tocino sauce from the pan over the top of the chicken

Garnish with the chopped spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
