<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your cauliflower[s] into 1 steak per person, approx. 3cm thick (use the middle part as it's larger!), reserve the remaining cauliflower and discard the leaves

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), cut into large chunks, then crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife, discard the skin</p><br><br>

Scrunch the foil around the cauliflower to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped pepper[s], peeled garlic and a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pepper is slightly charred</p><br><br>

Add your tomato paste, red wine vinegar, half your dried thyme (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Once the pepper is slightly charred, remove the tray[s] from the oven and transfer the roasted pepper and garlic to the food processor – this is your romesco mix</p><br><br>
