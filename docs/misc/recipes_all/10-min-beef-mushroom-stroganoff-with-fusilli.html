<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork & beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the mince is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mince has browned, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with most of your ground smoked paprika (save a little for garnish!) and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and Dijon mustard in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water – this is your mustard stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the mustard stock and soft cheese to the pan with the drained spaghetti, 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 2 min until the pasta is well coated in sauce and the pork & beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky pork, beef & mushroom spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky pork, beef & mushroom spaghetti in bowls

Sprinkle over the remaining ground smoked paprika and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
