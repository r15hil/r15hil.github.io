<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Grate your cheddar flavour block[s]

Break your lasagne sheets in the bag into bite-sized pieces

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<p>After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and give it a good stir

Top with the grated cheeze

Return the dish to the oven and cook, uncovered, for a final 25 min or until the pasta is tender – this is your one-pot plant-based butternut squash & spinach lasagne</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lasagne is almost done, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Add your balsamic vinegar to a large bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the shredded lettuce to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad

Pick your basil leaves from their stems, discard the stems</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot plant-based butternut squash & spinach lasagne with the dressed salad to the side

Garnish the lasagne with the basil leaves
