<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes then chop them into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your soft cheese in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> boiled water – this is your soft cheese mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have been cooking for 10 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add your smoked basa fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter, then once melted, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the soft cheese mixture with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a grind of black pepper

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy lemon sauce

Tip: If your sauce is too lemony, add a pinch of salt to temper the acidity</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes and peas to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash together – this is your pea mash

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa over the creamy lemon sauce with the pea mash to the side

Garnish with a handful of salad and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
