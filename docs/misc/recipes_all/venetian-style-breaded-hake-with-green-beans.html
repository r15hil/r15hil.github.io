<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add your chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are roasting, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Cut your lemon[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add the lemon halves (cut-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until caramelised, then set aside for later, reserving the pan

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dust a clean tray or plate with a generous sprinkling of flour and season with a big pinch of salt and pepper

Dip your hake fillet[s] into the seasoned flour until both sides are well coated and shake off any excess flour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wipe out the reserved pan with kitchen paper, then return to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated hake fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Venetian-style breaded hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat

Once boiling, trim, then add your green beans and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, add your clotted cream to the pan

Squeeze in the juice of half your caramelised lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your lemon sauce

Cut the remaining caramelised lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Venetian-style breaded hake with the crispy roast potatoes and green beans to the side

Drizzle the lemon sauce all over the fish

Garnish with a caramelised lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
