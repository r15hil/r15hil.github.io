<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the onion wedges and pepper strips to a large, deep baking tray (or two!) along with your cherry tomatoes, most of your ras el hanout (save some for later) and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, boil a half kettle

Combine your honey with half of your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a wide, shallow bowl – this is your harissa-honey marinade

Add your Greek cheese (keep it whole!) to the bowl and carefully coat in the harissa-honey marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Dissolve your tomato paste, vegetable stock mix and remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and pour in the tomato stock

Add the drained chickpeas

Give everything a good mix up and make a space in the middle of the tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the harissa-honey Greek cheese to the space in the tray[s], along with any remaining marinade

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 20-25 min, or until the vegetables are cooked through and the Greek cheese is soft – this is your spiced chickpea tray bake with harissa-honey Greek cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While everything's cooking, chop your wholemeal pitta[s] into bite-sized triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, the remaining ras el hanout and your toasted sesame seeds

Give it a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy – these are your seeded pitta triangles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced chickpea tray bake with harissa-honey Greek cheese with the seeded pitta triangles to the side

Tip: Use the pitta triangles to scoop everything up!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
