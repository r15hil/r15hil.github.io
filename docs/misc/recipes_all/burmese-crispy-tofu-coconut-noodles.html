<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the drained tofu into large bite-sized pieces

Combine the tofu pieces with 2/3 of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) in a large bowl and mix it all together – this is your marinated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your gram flour and ground smoked paprika in a separate bowl with your ground turmeric, half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your gram flour mix

Reserve 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> of gram flour mix, then add the remaining gram flour mix with the marinated tofu and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-8 min or until the tofu is crispy and golden – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and the reserved gram flour mix and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and the remaining soy sauce to the pot with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt

Whisk everything together until there are no lumps – this is your coconut broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your fine egg noodles and mooli slaw mix to the coconut broth, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are tender

Once tender, add the juice of half your lime[s] and stir it all together – these are your Burmese-style coconut noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Burmese-style coconut noodles in a bowl and top with the crispy tofu and chopped coriander

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
