<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the torn tofu and half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with your umami seasoning and cornflour

Give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan, reserve the bowl and cook for 10-12 min or until golden – this is your umami tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, combine your carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix with your mayo and half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a small pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved bowl clean

Combine your peanut butter with your remaining soy sauce and remaining rice vinegar in a bowl until smooth

Add the smashed cucumber and give everything a good mix up – this is your peanutty smashed cucumber</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked rice in bowls and layer over the peanutty smashed cucumber, creamy slaw and umami tofu

Drizzle your red chilli relish over the tofu – this is your sticky sweet chilli tofu bowl and peanutty smashed cucumber

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
