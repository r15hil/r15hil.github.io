<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add your cashew nuts to a large baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until the cashews are lightly toasted, then transfer to a plate and reserve the tray for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim and chop your spring onion[s] finely

Chop your parsley finely, keeping the stems and leaves separate

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) then chop into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to a large bowl with the chopped spring onion, diced apricots, chopped parsley stems, half of your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands, then divide the mixture and shape into 3 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the meat-free meatballs to one side of your reserved baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add the chopped pepper to the other side, then put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through and the pepper has softened – these are your harissa meat-free meatballs and roasted pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a large heatproof bowl

Add your couscous, cover and set aside until all the liquid has been absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your natural yoghurt to a separate bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your seasoned yoghurt

Chop the toasted cashews coarsely (only once they are cool enough to handle!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork, season with a grind of black pepper and mix most of the chopped parsley leaves through (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Once done, add the roasted pepper to the couscous and give it a good mix up</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa meat-free meatballs over the roasted pepper couscous with the seasoned yoghurt dotted over

Garnish with the toasted chopped cashews and reserved parsley leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
