<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper, then add them to a bowl with your curry powder and a pinch of salt

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Give everything a good mix up until the haddock is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place the coated haddock on a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and drizzle with vegetable oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the haddock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, flake the cooked haddock roughly with a fork and reserve the tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Run the drained sweet potato under cold running water until cool enough to handle, then return to the pot and mash until smooth

Add the flaked haddock to the crushed sweet potato with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then mix gently

Divide the mix and shape into 2 fish cakes per person, then press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the coated fish cakes to the reserved tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil (line the tray[s] with fresh tin foil)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – these are your curried haddock fish cakes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add the grated carrot, sliced radishes and sliced spring onion to a bowl with half your white wine vinegar, half your nigella seeds (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt – this is your tangy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Mix your mayo, mango chutney, remaining white wine vinegar, remaining nigella seeds and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried haddock fish cakes with the tangy slaw to the side

Drizzle some of the mango mayo over the fish cakes and serve the rest to the side for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
