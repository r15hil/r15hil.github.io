<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Chop your chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Crush your hazelnuts roughly in the bag with a rolling pin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat, then once hot, add the crushed hazelnuts and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly coloured, then transfer to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Grate your Italian hard cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil, add the sliced leek with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened, then add the chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min further

Meanwhile, strip your thyme leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Add your Chinese rice wine with half the thyme leaves (save the rest for later!) and the chopped mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have started to soften, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min or until the grains are fully coated in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper, then slice your flat white mushroom[s] into wedges and add to the tray

Sprinkle over the remaining thyme leaves, drizzle with olive oil and season generously with salt and black pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 5-6 min or until the flat white mushroom wedges are cooked through – these are your thyme-roasted flat white mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper, add 1/4 of the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) to the tray, and form into a long rectangular shape

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until the cheese has completely melted and is starting to brown

Once melted, remove the tray from the oven and set aside to cool

Once cooled, snap into 1 equal sized piece per person – these are your cheese tuiles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat

Stir in half your truffle oil (save the rest for later!), the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a large knob of butter – this is your truffled mushroom risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the truffled mushroom risotto topped with the thyme-roasted flat white mushrooms and crushed hazelnuts

Drizzle with the remaining truffle oil and top with a cheese tuile

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
