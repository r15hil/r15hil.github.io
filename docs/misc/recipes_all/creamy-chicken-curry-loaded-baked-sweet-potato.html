<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Pierce your sweet potato[es] with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 5-7 min or until slightly softened

Transfer the softened sweet potato to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and curry powder to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min

While the onion is softening, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste and stir it all together – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the curry has thickened, add the wilted spinach and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your creamy chicken curry

Once the potato is cooked, add your cashew nuts to the tray and return it to the oven for a further 2-3 min or until the cashews are golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted cashew nuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
