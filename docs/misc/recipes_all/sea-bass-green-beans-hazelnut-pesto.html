Once boiling, cook for an initial 10 min

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for for 3 min or until they are blistered - these are your blistered tomatoes

Once the tomatoes are blistered transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan with some kitchen paper and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Pat your sea bass dry and season on both sides with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the seasoned sea bass fillet[s], skin side down with the crushed garlic and cook for 5 min, then flip the sea bass and cook for 1 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
