<p><strong>Description:</strong> Pork Pibil is a traditional Mexican slow-roasted pork dish flavoured with citrus fruit and allspice. Our (slightly) quicker version roasts pork belly in both the juice and zest of an orange before serving it in smashed black bean, pickled shallot and cheddar cheese tacos. Mmm... Mexcellent!</p>

Combine the ground cumin, allspice and cayenne pepper (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the orange zest&nbsp;

Transfer the pork belly, fat side up,&nbsp;into the parcel and put it in the oven for 40-45 min
