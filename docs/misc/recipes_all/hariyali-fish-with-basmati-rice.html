<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it roughly

Combine the chopped tomato[es] and shredded lettuce in a large bowl and set aside for serving – this is your salad

In a separate bowl, combine the juice of the remaining lemon with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your zingy lemon dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your basa fillet[s] into strips

Season the chopped basa with a generous pinch of salt

Add the seasoned basa to a bowl with the Hariyali-style marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated basa to the pan (along with any remaining hariyali marinade from the bowl!) and cook for 8-9 min or until cooked through, turning once halfway – this is your Hariyali-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Hariyali-style basa with any cooked Hariyali-style marinade from the pan over the basmati rice with the salad to the side

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and drizzle the salad with the zingy lemon dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
