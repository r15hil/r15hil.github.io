<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a full kettle

Trim, then cut your green beans in half

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then roughly chop the softer inner core[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and the tough outer lemongrass layers to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the chopped green beans

Cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice and beans are cooking, peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green skins</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your cardamom seeds, soft innner core of the lemongrass and chopped shallot to a food processor with your crushed garlic and ginger paste

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your ground cinnamon (not a fan of cinnamon? Only add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and blitz until smooth – this is your rendang paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

Once browned, add the rendang paste and your lime leaf[ves] and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the chicken is browned and the paste is fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water with your chicken stock mix and fish sauce– this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken thighs are browned, add the coconut stock and cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce is thickened – this is your Indonesian-style chicken breast rendang</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the green bean rice with a fork

Serve the Indonesian-style chicken breast rendang over the green bean rice and garnish with your remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
