<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and grate your Italian hard cheese

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 75ml<span class="text-purple"> [100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a small knob of butter to a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the lemon zest and half the chopped garlic (you’ll use the rest later!), then heat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds until melted and stir it all together – this is your spicy lemon garlic drizzle

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt and rinse under cold running water until it's cool, then once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once your chicken is golden, add the remaining chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with the chicken stock and a small knob of butter and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pulled chicken to the pan with the chopped spinach, drained tortiglioni, your soft cheese and half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!), then add a splash of starchy pasta water and a pinch of salt and pepper (add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken & tomato tortiglioni

Cut the zested lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken & tomato tortiglioni topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and the spicy lemon garlic drizzle

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the spicy lemon garlic drizzle and just sprinkle over some grated cheese!</span>

Garnish with a lemon wedge and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
