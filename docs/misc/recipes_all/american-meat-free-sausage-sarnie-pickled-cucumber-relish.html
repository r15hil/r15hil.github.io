<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free sausages to the other side of the tray[s]

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use two trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are crispy and the sausages are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways then scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon and discard

Dice half the deseeded cucumber very finely (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]</p><br><br>
