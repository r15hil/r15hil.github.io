<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet to let it air

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Slice your sweet pointed pepper[s] into rings

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the onion wedges and sliced pepper and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your arborio rice, ground smoked paprika, saffron and half your roasted garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) to the dish and stir everything together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chicken stock mix and tomato paste with 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until most of the water has absorbed and the rice and chicken is cooked (no pink meat!) – this is your one pot chicken breast paella</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining roasted garlic paste (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and mayo in a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your roasted garlic aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one pot chicken breast paella drizzled with the roasted garlic aioli

To garnish, chop your parsley roughly over the paella with scissors
