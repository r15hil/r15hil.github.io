Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably nonstick) with a matching lid on a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil and a large knob of butter (optional)


When hot, add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8 min or until softened and brown at the edges, stirring occasionally</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the paste to the onions with the turmeric, ground cumin and cinnamon, and cook for 2 min on a medium heat, stirring as you go to coat the onions evenly


Tip: add a drizzle of oil if the spices look too dry


Add the tomato paste and cook for a further 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomatoes to the onion pan


Tip: for a smoother sauce, strain and mash as much of the chopped tomatoes through a sieve into the pan first, before adding the remnants


Stir well and cook for 1-2 min, or until a thick sauce is achieved, then lower the heat to medium-low</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the chicken into 3cm cubes


Stir the yoghurt&nbsp;into the pan until evenly distributed


Add the chicken to the pan and stir well, then add a lid and cook for 20 min on a medium-low heat (the sauce should be gently boiling) or until the chicken is tender and nearly cooked through</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, add the rice, 375ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> water and a pinch of&nbsp;salt &nbsp;to a pot with a lid on a high heat and bring to the boil


Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cover for 15-20 min or until the water is absorbed


Check to prevent over-cooking and once done, fluff with a fork and set aside covered until serving</p><br><br>

<p>Once the chicken has had 20 min, remove the lid, add the ground almonds and stir well


Cook for another 5 min (without the lid) on a medium-low heat, or until the chicken is cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Check the curry for seasoning - adding salt and pepper to your taste


Serve the curry over the fluffed, hot rice</p><br><br>
