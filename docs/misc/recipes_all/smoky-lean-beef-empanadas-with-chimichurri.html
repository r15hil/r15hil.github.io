<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

One hot, add the chopped shallot and lean beef mince to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the mince is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl using a slotted spoon (leave as much oil behind as possible!) and add the smoked paprika, ground cumin, cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt – this is your smoky lean beef mixture

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut into 4<span class="text-danger"> [8] </span>rectangles and add them to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Divide the smoky lean beef mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and add to the middle of the pastry rectangles

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Tip: This helps to seal the pastry!

Fold the pastry over the smoky lean beef mixture so that both short sides of the rectangle are touching

Press the pastry together with your fingers to seal in the beef with as little air trapped inside as possible

Tip: Don't worry if they look messy, they'll be tidied up later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Trim the edges of the pastry into a semi-circle shape

Use a fork to crimp the edges of the pastry and prick air holes in the top – these are your lean beef empanadas

Put the lean beef empanadas in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown – these are your smoky lean beef empanadas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the empanadas are cooking, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the chopped chilli, parsley and garlic with the dried oregano, red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your chimichurri</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop into wedges

Combine half of the chimichurri (save the rest for garnish!) with the mayo in a small bowl – this is your chimichurri mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky lean beef empanadas with the lettuce wedges, chips and chimichurri mayo to the side

Dollop the reserved chimichurri over the baby leaf salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
