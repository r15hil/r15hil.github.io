<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chunky chips to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-8 min or until part-cooked

Meanwhile, add the shredded red cabbage to a large bowl with half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up

Set aside until serving – this is your pickled red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once done, drain and lay the chips flat on a baking tray to steam dry

Tip: For extra crispy chips, carefully shake them around in the colander to fluff up the edges a little before baking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chips have dried, add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil to the chips and season with a generous pinch of salt then give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy, turning once halfway through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the chips are cooking, combine the mayo with the tomato paste, dried oregano, ground paprika and remaining cider vinegar

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Belgian Hellmann's mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut the brioche buns in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once done, set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Season the beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, then shape into patties

Return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the patties and cook them for 5-6 min on each side or until they're cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Build your burger by topping the base with some pickled red cabbage, a beef patty, some chunky chips, a drizzle of the Belgian Hellmann's mayo and the lid

Serve with the remaining chunky chips, pickled cabbage and Belgian Hellmann's mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
