<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the shallot is softening, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once softened, add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes are beginning to soften, add your tomato paste and 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min, breaking the 'Nduja up in the pan as you go

Add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the sauce

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the risotto is cooking, zest of half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half lengthways

When the risotto is almost ready, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli and cook for 10-12 min or until slightly charred and tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is ready, stir through your soft cheese, half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of half your lemon[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1-2 min – this is your spicy 'Nduja risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy 'Nduja risotto in bowls and top with the pan-fried Tenderstem

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and lemon zest over the Tenderstem broccoli – this is your zesty Tenderstem broccoli

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
