<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with your cumin seeds, ground turmeric, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your spiced chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and a squeeze of lemon juice in a large bowl with your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the bowl along with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your harissa slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until they're warm and crusty, then carefully slice them in half before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, along with a squeeze of lemon juice, the chopped parsley and mint, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herby pulled chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed ciabattas with the herby pulled chicken and some of the harissa slaw – this is your herby pulled chicken sandwich

Serve the spiced chips and remaining harissa slaw to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
