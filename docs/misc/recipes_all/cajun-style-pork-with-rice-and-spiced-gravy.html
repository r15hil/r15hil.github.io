<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the vegetables are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your ground smoked paprika and dried oregano in a bowl with your ground coriander and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your smoky spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>cold water to the pan with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned steak and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy Cajun-style pork

Once done, transfer the cooked steak to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 2 min, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add a small knob of butter with your cornflour and cook for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms

Add in your chicken stock mix with the remaining smoky spice mix, 125ml <span class="text-purple">[190ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of sugar

Cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your spiced gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the spicy Cajun-style pork finely

Serve the sliced spicy Cajun-style pork with the rice to the side

Pour over the spiced gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
