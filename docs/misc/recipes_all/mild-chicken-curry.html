<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a pot with a lid over a medium heat

Once hot, add your basmati rice with a pinch of ground turmeric (save the rest for later!)

Cook for 30 secs or until the grains are coated in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml]</span> cold water and your sultanas and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sultana rice</p><br><br>
