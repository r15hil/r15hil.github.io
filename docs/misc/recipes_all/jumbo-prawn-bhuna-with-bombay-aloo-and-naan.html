<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion, black mustard seeds  with the ground turmeric and ground cumin, chopped potatoes, 1/3 of the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, then cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until almost tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the red onion wedges and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Meanwhile, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Once the onion wedges have softened, add the chopped ginger with the remaining garlic and the chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs

Add the garam masala, halved cherry tomatoes and tomato paste and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a little more vegetable oil if the pan is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the remaining stock and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency

Drain the jumbo prawns

Add the drained jumbo prawns to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your jumbo prawn bhuna

Tip: Once the jumbo prawns are cooked through, season to taste!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are almost cooked through, remove the lid and continue to cook for 2-3 min or until all the water has evaporated and the potatoes are tender – this is your Bombay aloo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the water is evaporating, add the mini garlic & coriander naans to a baking tray (alternatively, just pop them in the toaster)

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naan once it's out of the oven</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the jumbo prawn bhuna with the Bombay aloo and hot mini garlic & coriander naans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
