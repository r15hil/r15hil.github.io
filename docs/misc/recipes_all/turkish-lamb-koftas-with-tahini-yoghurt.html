<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until they're fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and set aside to steam dry in the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add half of your white wine vinegar to a large bowl (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and stir until dissolved

Add your shredded red cabbage to the bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside until later to pickle slightly – this is your quick-pickled cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your brown onion[s] and cut in half

Grate half your onion[s] and slice the remaining onion finely

Add your grated onion, panko breadcrumbs, baharat, lamb mince and a generous pinch of salt to a large bowl – this is your lamb mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Knead the lamb mix thoroughly with clean hands for 2-3 min (this helps the mixture hold together when cooking) then shape into 3 koftas per person

Tip: Oil your hands slightly to stop the mixture sticking when shaping!

Add the koftas to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until  cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Turkish-style lamb koftas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic, natural yoghurt, tahini paste and the remaining white wine vinegar to a bowl

Add a splash of cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tahini yoghurt

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste cook for 1 min

Add the drained potatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt, then crush the potatoes lightly and cook for 5-6 min or until they're starting to crisp

Once the potatoes are crisp, remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped parsley</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Turkish-style lamb koftas over the tahini yoghurt with the crushed potatoes and quick-pickled cabbage to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
