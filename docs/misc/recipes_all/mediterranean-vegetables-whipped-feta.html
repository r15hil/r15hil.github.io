<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the courgette discs, chopped pepper, cherry tomatoes and drained chickpeas to a baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over the grated garlic

Squeeze over the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until the veg is lightly charred and juicy – these are your Mediterranean-style vegetables</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the veg is in the oven, combine your natural yoghurt and goats' cheese and whisk together until fairly smooth

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your naan[s] in half on the diagonal, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot – these are your chilli naans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Serve the Mediterranean-style vegetables with the whipped goats' cheese and chilli naans to the side

Sprinkle over the chopped parsley and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
