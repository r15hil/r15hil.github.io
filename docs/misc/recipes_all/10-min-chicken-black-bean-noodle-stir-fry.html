<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!


Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the medium egg noodles to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with boiled water until fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>
