<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the grated courgette to the middle of a clean tea towel (or kitchen paper) and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the grated courgette to a bowl with most of the sliced spring onion (save a little for garnish!), the grated Italian hard cheese, cornflour, 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your fritter mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (save the pan for the next step!) – these are your cheesy courgette fritters

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the cheesy courgette fritters to an oven-proof dish and put them in the oven to keep warm

Return the fritter pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack the remaining eggs into the pan

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Layer the cheesy courgette fritters on top of one another

Top the fritters with a fried egg and serve the crispy bacon and roasted cherry tomatoes to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion and a grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
