<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 3-4 min or until the potato is fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>finely

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potato has softened, mash with a fork

Add the ground smoked paprika and crab meat to the mashed potato with half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the chopped shallot (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your crab filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> rectangles and add them to a baking paper-lined tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the crab filling to the middle of each pastry rectangle, then brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Tip: This helps to seal the pastry!

Fold the pastry over the empanada filling so that both short sides of the rectangle are touching

Press the pastry together with your fingers to seal in the crab filling with as little air trapped inside as possible</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim the edges of the pastry into a semi-circle shape

Use a fork to crimp the edges of the pastry – these are your crab empanadas

Put the crab empanadas in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – these are your smoky crab empanadas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the chopped tomato, remaining chopped shallot and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl with the chopped coriander, half the white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa

Add the remaining white wine vinegar and baby leaf salad to a large bowl with 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and mix it all together – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky crab empanadas with the tomato salsa over the top and the dressed salad to one side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
