<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and onion wedges and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken is starting to brown and the onion is starting to soften

Meanwhile cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely, set some aside for garnish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely, then chop the leaves finely and set aside for garnish

Cut your lime[s] in half

Crush the roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the chopped coriander stalks to the pan

Add your cultured coconut and the juice of half the lime[s] to the pan — this is your Thai-style free range chicken & coconut curry

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style free range chicken & coconut curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped peanuts, chopped coriander leaves, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
