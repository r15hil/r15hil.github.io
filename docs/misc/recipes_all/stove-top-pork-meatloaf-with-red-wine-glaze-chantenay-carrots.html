<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain over a large bowl (save the water for later!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and slice 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> brown onion<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely and grate the remaining onion

Peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Combine the red wine paste, tomato paste and honey in a small bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water – this is your red wine glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the pork mince and grated onion in a medium bowl with the dried thyme, panko breadcrumbs, half the grated garlic and half the beef stock mix

Season with a grind of pepper and using clean hands give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your pork mixture

Shape the pork mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>mini<span class="text-danger"> </span>loaves

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatloaves to the pan and cook for 2-3 min, turning occasionally until browned on all sides

Once browned, turn the heat down to low, add 80ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water to the pan and drizzle the red wine glaze over the meatloaves (reserve the bowl) and cook, covered for 20-22 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash then chop the cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 16-17 min or until golden and crispy, turning occasionally for even colouring</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>knobs of butter

Once melted, add the sliced onion and remaining garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add the Chantenay carrots (no need to top or peel!) with 120ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>reserved potato water and cook, covered for an initial 8-9 min or until tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the carrots have had an initial 8-9 min, add the chopped cavolo nero and cook, covered for a final 2-3 min or until wilted – these are your Chantenay carrots & greens

Add the cornflour and soy sauce to the reserved small bowl with the remaining beef stock mix and gradually stir in 130ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water (this is to ensure there's no lumps!) – this is your gravy mix

Put the gravy mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring half way – this is your gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork meatloaves with the crispy potatoes and Chantenay carrots & greens to the side

Add any remaining red wine glaze from the pan to the gravy and give everything a good mix up – this is your red wine gravy

Drizzle the red wine gravy all over everything

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
