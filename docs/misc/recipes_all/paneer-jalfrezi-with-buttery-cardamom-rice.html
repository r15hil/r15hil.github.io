<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the paneer cubes and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once golden, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Return the pan to a medium heat with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a small pinch of salt, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-8 min or until soft and starting to caramelise

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Heat a pot with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the crushed cardamom and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to the softened onion and cook for a further 5-8 min or until starting to brown, stirring occasionally

While the vegetables are browning, dissolve your vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and curry powder to the pan and stir until the vegetables are coated</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/519.step-7-x200.jpg' alt='Step 7 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste and stir for 1 min, then return the golden paneer to the pan with the tomato wedges and vegetable stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 5-10 min or until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your paneer jalfrezi

Taste for seasoning, adding some pepper if you like it hot

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the paneer jalfrezi with the cardamom rice to the side (watch out for the cardamom pods!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
