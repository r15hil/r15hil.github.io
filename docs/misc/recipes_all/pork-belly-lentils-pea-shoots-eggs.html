<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a take on an old British classic - Ham and Eggs. Here, the 'ham' is pork belly. The trick to a good pork belly is getting the fat rendered down and seasoned so you can appreciate its glorious flavour which you'll flavour with sweet, fragrant fennel seeds. Served over a carrot, pea shoot and lentil salad and topped off with a perfect egg. </p>
