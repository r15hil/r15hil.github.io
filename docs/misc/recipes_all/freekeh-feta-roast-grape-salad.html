<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your freekeh under cold water, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 20-25 min or until tender but with a bite, then drain and set aside for serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the freekah is cooking, cut your seedless grapes in half lengthways

Add the halved grapes and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a sheet of tin foil on one end of a baking tray, scrunching the edges into a package to prevent the juices from escaping

Place the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the grapes have started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the grapes are in the oven, combine your red wine vinegar with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a mixing bowl (large enough to toss the whole salad in) – this is your vinaigrette

Trim then finely slice your spring onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the grapes have had 10 min, add your feta to the same tray

Sprinkle your ground cumin over the feta and return the tray to the oven for approx. 5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop it roughly and set it aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the feta has had 5 min, add your almonds to the tray and drizzle them with a little olive oil

Return the tray to the oven for a final 3-5 min or until the almonds have darkened in colour slightly

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the almonds have toasted, remove the whole tray from the oven and allow everything to cool slightly

Once cool enough to handle, roughly chop the toasted almonds

Crumble the baked feta into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the drained freekah, roasted grapes, chopped almonds, sliced spring onions, chopped salad and crumbled baked feta to the vinaigrette and give everything a gentle mix

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
