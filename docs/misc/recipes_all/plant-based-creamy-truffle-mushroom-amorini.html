<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer the toasted pine nuts to a small bowl and set aside for later

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
