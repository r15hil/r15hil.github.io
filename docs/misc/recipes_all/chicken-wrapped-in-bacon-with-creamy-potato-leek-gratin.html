<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your leek[s] into rounds and wash thoroughly to remove any grit, then slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the sliced potato and leek rounds to a pot of plenty of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until softened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the veg has softened slightly, drain it and transfer to an oven-proof dish (save the pot!)

Meanwhile, melt 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g]</span> butter in the reserved pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Remove the béchamel sauce from the heat, season with a grind of black pepper and stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese and Dijon mustard – this is your cheesy béchamel

Pour the cheesy béchamel over the leek & potato and top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, reserve the pot

Cook for 30-35 min or until the potato is cooked through and the top is golden – this is your creamy potato & leek gratin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the gratin is cooking, wrap your chicken breast portion[s] in your smoked streaky bacon, then transfer to a baking paper-lined tray

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the bacon is slightly crispy – this is your chicken wrapped in bacon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate!) your garlic

Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 1-2 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Once softened, add the chopped garlic to the pot along with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock to the pot and cook for 5-6 min or until reduced to a gravy-like consistency – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and blanched peas and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your buttery greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken wrapped in bacon with the creamy potato & leek gratin and buttery greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
