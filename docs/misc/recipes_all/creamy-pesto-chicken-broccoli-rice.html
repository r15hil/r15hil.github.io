<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash, then add the spinach to the pan with half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous grind of pepper

Cook for 1-2 min further until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy pesto chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy pesto chicken over the warmed broccoli brown rice

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and tear over the basil leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
