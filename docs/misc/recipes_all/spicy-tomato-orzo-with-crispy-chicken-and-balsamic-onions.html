<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry and season them generously on both sides with salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

Once browned, transfer the crispy chicken to a plate, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice half your red onion[s]

Chop the remaining onion into small wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the onion wedges to a large piece of tin foil with your balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>sugar and a splash of cold water and give everything a good mix up

Scrunch the foil around the onion wedges to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to one side of a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After the initial 10 min, remove the baking tray from the oven and add the crispy chicken to the other side of the baking tray (skin side up)

Return the tray to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion is softened and jammy – these are your balsamic onions (save the juices)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your tomato paste and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your orzo to the pan with the chicken stock and chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your spicy tomato orzo

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy tomato orzo with the crispy chicken and half the balsamic onions on top

Toss the salad with the remaining balsamic onions and a small drizzle of olive oil, then serve to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
