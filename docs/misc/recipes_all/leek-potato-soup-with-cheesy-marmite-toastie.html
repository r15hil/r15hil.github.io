<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Set some butter near a warm place to get to room temperature and reserve for easy spreading later on

Chop the leeks in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leeks with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the leeks soften, peel and chop the potatoes into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the leeks have softened, remove 1/4 from the pot and set aside for later (this will add extra texture to your soup!)

Add the chopped potatoes, chopped garlic and vegetable stock and cook over a medium-high heat for 12-15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Grate the cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice the ciabattas in half

Spread the reserved butter over the tops and bottoms of the ciabattas, then spread the Marmite (don’t like Marmite? Go easy!) evenly between the insides of the ciabattas

Sandwich the grated cheese between the ciabattas – these are your cheesy Marmite sandwiches</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cheesy Marmite sandwiches and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (e.g. several cans) to the top pan and cook for 2-3 min per side, checking occasionally – these are your cheesy Marmite toasties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are done, stir the soft cheese through the soup and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Stir the reserved leeks through the soup and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your leek & potato soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the cheesy Marmite toasties into thirds lengthways (soldiers) and serve with the leek & potato soup

Chop the chives finely

Sprinkle the chopped chives over the soup and drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
