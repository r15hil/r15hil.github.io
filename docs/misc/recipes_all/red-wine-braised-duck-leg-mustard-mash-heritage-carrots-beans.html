<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Caramelise the mushrooms


Discard some of the fat from the pan so you're left with just 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>. Return it to a medium heat.


Once hot, add the&nbsp;diced onion&nbsp;and&nbsp;chestnut mushrooms&nbsp;and cook for 5-6 minutes or until beginning to soften and caramelise.


Meanwhile, dissolve the&nbsp;chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Just Add Wine sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 400ml&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Prepare your stew for the oven


Once caramelised, add 1 tbsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;flour&nbsp;to the&nbsp;onion&nbsp;and&nbsp;mushrooms,&nbsp;give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 minutes.


Gradually add the wine stock to the pan and cook for 1 minute or until combined.


Add the duck legs to an oven-proof dish with the shallots&nbsp;and&nbsp;bay leaves.


Pour the&nbsp;wine braise&nbsp;all over and cover the dish tightly with tin foil (or a matching lid).

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Braise the duck


Put the dish in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the duck is tender. Re-boil a kettle.


Once the duck has had 1 hour and 15 minutes, peel and chop the&nbsp;potatoes&nbsp;into rough, bite-sized pieces.


Add the&nbsp;chopped potatoes&nbsp;to a pot of&nbsp;boiling water&nbsp;with a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;over a high heat and cook for 10-15 minutes or until fork-tender.


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot.

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Crispen the duck 


Once the duck has had 1 hour and 30 minutes, increase the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7.


Remove the foil from the dish and cook for 20 minutes further or until the duck is crispy and the sauce has reduced to a gravy-like consistency.


Meanwhile, clean and scrub the&nbsp;heritage baby carrots to remove any dirt (no need to peel!).


Chop the chives and&nbsp;parsley finely.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

Return the&nbsp;potatoes&nbsp;to a low heat with a splash of&nbsp;milk&nbsp;and a knob of&nbsp;butter.


Mash until smooth, then stir in the&nbsp;wholegrain mustard&nbsp;and season generously with&nbsp;salt.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up! 


Once the&nbsp;veg are cooked, sprinkle over the&nbsp;chopped parsley and chives&nbsp;and give everything a good mix up.&nbsp;
