<h4>Step 2</h4>

Cut the lemon[s] into 4 wedges per lemon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the garlic is fragrant, add your orzo to the pan with the juice of 1/4 of the lemon wedges

Add the creamy stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your creamy orzo

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to stop it from sticking!</p><br><br>

Once hot, drain, then add your jumbo prawns and the spinach and cook for 4-5 min

Tear in your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of 1/4 of the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon wedges and cook for 2-3 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and the ’Nduja has broken down – these are your 'Nduja jumbo prawns</p><br><br>

Add the juice of the remaining lemon wedges to a bowl with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a grind of black pepper – this is your lemony dressing

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy orzo with the 'Nduja jumbo prawns over the top – this is your creamy spinach orzo with 'Nduja jumbo prawns

Spoon any remaining 'Nduja oil from the pan over the orzo

Serve the baby leaf salad to the side drizzled with the lemony dressing
