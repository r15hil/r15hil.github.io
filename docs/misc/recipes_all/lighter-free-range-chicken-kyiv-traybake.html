<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato and courgette discs to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your chives finely

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Combine your panko breadcrumbs with the lemon zest, half the chopped chives (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once everything is starting to soften, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to the tray[s] over the veg

Squeeze the juice of half the lemon[s] over the chicken and top with the herby crumb

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 15 min

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated garlic and cook for 1 min

Add the chicken stock and soft cheese and give it a good mix up until smooth

Cook for 2-3 min or until thickened slightly

Once thickened, add the chopped parsley and remaining chopped chives – this is your garlic 'butter'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Once the chicken has had and initial 15 min, add the sliced spring greens to the tray[s]

Return the tray to the oven for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the spring greens are wilted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Dollop the garlic 'butter' over the herby crumbed chicken – this is your free range chicken kyiv

Serve the free range chicken kyiv with the sliced spring greens, roasted courgette and crispy potatoes to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
