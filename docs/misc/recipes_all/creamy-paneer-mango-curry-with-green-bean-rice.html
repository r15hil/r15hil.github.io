Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Stand the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh, discarding the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
