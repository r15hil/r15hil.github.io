<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Crush your garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife, then remove the skins and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic to the dish with your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<p>Stir in your vegetable stock mix, then add your chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 25 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pasta has been cooking for 25 min, remove the dish from the oven

Drain your king prawns, then add them to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and the pasta is tender – this is your oven-baked spicy king prawn arrabbiata farfalle

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, tear your basil leaves into the oven-baked spicy king prawn arrabbiata farfalle and stir through your grated Italian hard cheese with a large knob of butter

Garnish with your salad and season with a grind of pepper
