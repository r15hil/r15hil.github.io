<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Add the halved pepper, cut-side down, to the other side and press down with your hand to flatten it

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the chips and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the chips are golden and the pepper has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your honey with your Marmite, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp</span>] <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your fiery Marmite glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into strips

Add your cornflour to a separate bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chicken strips and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 8-10 min, turning frequently, or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Tip: Add more oil to the pan if it is looking a little dry

Meanwhile, slice your red chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the crispy chicken to a plate covered with kitchen paper and carefully pour away any excess oil

Return the pan to a low heat, add the fiery Marmite glaze and cook for 30 secs or until starting to thicken

Return the crispy chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up until nicely coated in the glaze – this is your fiery Marmite-glazed chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Fill your toasted brioche buns with a dollop of mayo, a roasted pepper half, the fiery Marmite-glazed chicken and the salad

Serve the chips to the side and garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – these are your chilli fries

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
