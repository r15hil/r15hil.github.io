<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the diced onion and grated cheddar to a large bowl with the crumbled feta, drained sweetcorn, vegetable stock mix, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), most of your ground smoked paprika and your soft cheese

Give everything a good mix up – this is your three-cheese filling

Combine the remaining ground smoked paprika with a small drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl and mix it all together – this is your smoky oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide the three-cheese filling between your tortillas (make sure to only cover one half of the tortilla with the filling!)

Fold each tortilla over so you're left with 3 half moon-shaped sandwiches per person– these are your loaded quesadillas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the loaded quesadillas to a baking tray (or two!)

Brush each loaded quesadilla with the smoky oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut a piece[s] of baking paper approx. the size of the baking tray[s]

Place a baking paper piece on top of the loaded quesadillas, then add a second baking tray on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked baking tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min, or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted – these are your three-cheese corn quesadillas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a small dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nut & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the base of your living lettuce then wash the living lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the living lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves

Chop your chives finely and add them to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your chive dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Toss the living lettuce and chive dressing together – this is your tangy chive salad

Serve the three-cheese corn quesadillas with the tangy chive salad to the side

Sprinkle the toasted pine nut & seed mix over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
