Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Wash the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-9 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the panko breadcrumbs to a baking tray with half the chopped garlic, half the lemon zest (save the rest for later!), the chopped parsley, grated Italian hard cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until golden – this is your cheesy crumb</p><br><br>

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with a lemon wedge
