<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your tomatoes in half and season them lightly with salt and pepper


Transfer the coloured aubergine to the baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the bulgur to a pot with plenty of salted boiled water over a high heat


Cook for 10-12 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot


Meanwhile, mix the pomegranate molasses and the honey together - this is your glaze

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Spread the glaze evenly&nbsp;over the cooked aubergine then top with the breadcrumbs


Tip: Working one at a time prevents the glaze from running off the aubergine and the breadcrumbs will help hold it in place


Place the baking tray on the top rack of your oven and cook for 5-7 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden brown in colour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the dill, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper through the drained bulgur


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy glazed aubergine over the bulgur, crumble the Rosary goats' cheese over and serve the tomatoes alongside


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
