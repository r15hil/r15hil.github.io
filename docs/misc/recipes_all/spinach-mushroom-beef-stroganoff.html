<p><strong>Description:</strong> Beef stroganoff - a classic Russian dish made with beef, mushrooms, smoked paprika, cream and parsley. Typically it contains gherkins, but we've opted for capers which give a similar saltiness and acidity to cut through the sauce. Our version combines baby spinach and British beef mince, for a quicker cook. Stroganoffally good! </p>
