<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, boil a full kettle, then peel your potatoes and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with the chopped potatoes and red Thai curry paste and cook for 6 min or until the chicken is lightly coloured</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves and top, tail and slice finely

Top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly coloured, add your cornflour to the pot with the sliced shallot, sliced leek, sliced carrot and pepper strips

Stir everything together and cook for 1-2 min or until the shallot has slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 700ml<span class="text-purple"> [910ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2 L]</span> boiled water with your lime leaf[ves] and fish sauce – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has slightly softened, add the coconut stock to the pan with a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, lower the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender – this is your Thai-style spiced chicken breast, leek & potato soup</p><br><br>

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves
