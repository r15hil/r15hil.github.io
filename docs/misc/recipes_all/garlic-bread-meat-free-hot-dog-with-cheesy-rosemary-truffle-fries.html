<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the fries and chopped rosemary to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your rosemary fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free hot dog sausage[s] to one side of a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook for 10-12 min or until softened and caramelised – this is your balsamic caramelised onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add a generous knob of butter to a bowl with the chopped garlic, chopped parsley and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic & parsley butter

Tip: If your butter is not soft then microwave for a few secs or until soft to the touch but not melted!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut a slit into the top of your hot dog bun[s] and then cut a few slits across diagonally (being careful not to cut all the way through!)

Spoon the garlic & parsley butter into each slit – these are your garlic bread bun[s]

Once the sausage[s] has had an initial 20 min remove the tray from the oven and add the bun[s] to other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce and chopped tomato to a large bowl with the remaining balsamic vinegar and toss until coated – this is your tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Drizzle the rosemary fries with your truffle oil (not a fan of truffle? Just add a little!) and top with the grated Italian hard cheese – these are your cheesy rosemary & truffle fries

Fill each garlic bread bun with a meat-free hot dog sausage and top with the balsamic caramelised onion, then serve the tomato salad and cheesy rosemary & truffle fries to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
