<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are in the oven, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once cooked, remove the pizzas from the oven and break your goats' cheese up all over them – these are your goats' cheese & red pepper pizzas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the goats' cheese & red pepper pizzas with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the balsamic dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
