<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tofu and cornflour to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is completely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan (reserve the bowl and any remaining cornflour!)

Cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy all over, turning occasionally, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and reserve the pan – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and onion petals and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the veg has softened, add your hoisin sauce and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly

Once thickened, add the crispy tofu to the pan – this is your hoisin tofu & red pepper stir-fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hoisin tofu & red pepper stir-fry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
