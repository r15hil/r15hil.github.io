<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Reboil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add most of your crab meat (save the rest for garnish!), roasted garlic paste and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs

Add your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil with the juice of half your lime[s] and a generous pinch of sugar and cook for 30 secs further

Reduce the heat to low – this is your crab sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to a colander and pour boiled water all over until bright green and wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain the soaked noodles, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water, then add the drained noodles to the crab sauce with the wilted spring greens

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined – these are your chilli crab & spring green noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli crab & spring green noodles and season with a pinch of salt, then sprinkle over the remaining crab meat and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Garnish with the chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
