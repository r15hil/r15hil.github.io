<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Preheat the grill to medium-high</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the diced chorizo to the pan and cook for 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the tortillas to a large baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in two batches!

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and spread over both sides of the wraps

Put the tray under the grill for 3-4 min, turning the wraps once halfway so they brown evenly on both sides

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tortillas are cooking, deseed the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Add the chopped pepper to the pan with the chorizo and cook for 1 min

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomatoes, drained cannellini beans and half of the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min or until the pepper has softened – this is your chorizo mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Combine the remaining smoked paprika with the mayo and half of the white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl – this is your smoky mayo

Wash the salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread some of the chorizo mixture, grated cheese and a few salad leaves (save some for garnish!) on the first tortilla of each stack

Layer on the second tortilla and repeat

Top with the final tortilla and drizzle the smoky mayo over the top

Repeat this process for the other smoky chorizo tortilla stack<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chorizo tortilla stacks with any remaining salad to the side

Pour the remaining white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
