<p><strong>Description:</strong> Tabbouleh, pronounced 'tab-boo-lay', is a bulgur wheat salad, traditionally served as part of a mezze. We love the wholesome feel from the spiced beef mince, bulgur, fresh cucumber, cherry tomatoes, parsley and lemon all tumbled together. The perfect quick and easy meal!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Carefully discard any excess oil from the pan, then stir in your ras el hanout and cook for 1 min

Sprinkle in your beef stock mix and add a splash of cold water, then give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 4-6 min or until the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<p>Serve the tabbouleh-style spiced beef salad and top with the reserved chopped parsley

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
