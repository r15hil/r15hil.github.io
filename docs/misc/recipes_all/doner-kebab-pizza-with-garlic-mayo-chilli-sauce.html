<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or 2!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the mince is brown, add half your grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, dried oregano and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, set aside until you're ready to build your pizza – this is your doner beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste to a bowl with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp] </span>cold water and a very generous pinch of salt – this is your tomato sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven and add your pizza bases

Divide the tomato sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top the pizza bases with the doner beef and grated cheddar and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the cheese has melted, the bases are crisp and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your pizzas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your mayo to a bowl with the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a splash of cold water – this is your garlic mayo

Add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small bowl with a small splash of cold water – this is your chilli sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, drizzle the garlic mayo and chilli sauce over the pizzas and top with the quick-pickled shallots – these are your doner kebab pizzas

Serve the doner kebab pizzas

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
