<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, your ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the sweet potato is cooked through and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sweet potato is cooking, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your chicken escalope[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Spread your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over both sides of the chicken escalope[s] using the back of a spoon

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate and season with a pinch of salt – these are your seasoned breadcrumbs

Add the coated chicken to the seasoned breadcrumbs and press firmly to coat evenly all over – this is your breaded chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min on each side (cooking for 5? Do this in batches!) or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chipotle chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop half your lime[s] into wedges and set them aside for garnish

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), a squeeze of lime juice, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your lime mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad, roasted sweet potato and sliced spring onion to a bowl with the lime mayo and gently mix together – this is your zingy sweet potato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy chipotle chicken with the zingy sweet potato salad to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
