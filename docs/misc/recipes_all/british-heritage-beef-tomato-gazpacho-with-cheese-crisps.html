<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop half the coriander finely, including stalks (you'll use the rest later!)

Combine the diced vegetables and chopped coriander in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your diced vegetable salad

Slice the remaining ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12] </span>slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the ciabatta slices to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle the grated Italian hard cheese onto the other side of the tray and put it in the oven for 8 min or until the ciabatta is lightly toasted and the cheese has melted – these are your ciabatta toasts & cheese crisp

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining chopped peppers, quartered cucumber, onion wedges and heritage tomato wedges to a food processor with the peeled garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)and remaining coriander

Add the ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), vegetable stock mix and red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Blend the vegetables together, gradually adding the torn ciabatta

Once all the ciabatta has been added, blitz until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your heritage beef tomato gazpacho</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the heritage beef tomato gazpacho in bowls with the ciabatta toasts to the side

Garnish with the diced vegetable salad and break the cheese crisp into shards over the top

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
