<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into bite-sized pieces

Peel, then chop your potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato and carrot to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into<span class="text-danger"> </span>1 square per person

Add the pastry squares to the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your pie lids</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the pie lids are cooking, cut your Brussels sprouts in half lengthways

Add them to a separate baking tray with your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15 min or until the sprouts are tender and slightly crispy – these are your balsamic roasted sprouts

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sprouts are cooking, dissolve your crème fraîche and soy sauce in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Add the stock to the mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to a single cream-like consistency – these are your creamy mushrooms

Once thickened, strip your thyme leaves from their stems (discard the stems) into the pan with the creamy mushrooms and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potato & carrot to a low heat and add a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mash, then season generously with salt – this is your potato & carrot mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy mushrooms with the potato & carrot mash and balsamic roasted sprouts to the side

Sit the pie lid over the creamy mushrooms

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
