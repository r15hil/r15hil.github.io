<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Add half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt to the cooked brown rice and give it a good mix up – this is your coriander rice

Once the sauce has thickened, add the wilted spinach and half the natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken tikka masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken tikka masala over the coriander rice

Drizzle with the remaining natural yoghurt and garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
