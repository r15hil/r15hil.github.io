<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, cut your chicken breast portions into strips

Add the chicken strips to a bowl with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mix well until evenly coated

Add your soy sauce to the bowl and mix to combine

Add your cornflour to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated in the cornflour mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken strips and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken

Tip: Add more oil to the pan if it is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the sliced brioche rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill your warmed brioche buns with the lettuce leaves, sliced tomato, fried chicken and sriracha mayo

Serve the chips and lettuce halves to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with the dressing and serve any remaining sriracha mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
