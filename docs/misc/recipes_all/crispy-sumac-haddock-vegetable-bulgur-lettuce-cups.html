<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 230°C/ 210°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the pepper strips, tomato wedges and garlic (skin on) to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with your ground coriander, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the pepper is charred

Whilst the vegetables are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely, then add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, remove 3 outer leaves per person and set aside, then shred the inner core</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks, then finely chop your dill

Add your bulgur wheat and your vegetable stock mix to a pot with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your cornflour with half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of salt in a bowl

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper, then add to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until the haddock is fully coated

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated haddock bites and cook for 5-6 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through – this is your crispy sumac haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the haddock is cooking, add the chopped dill to a bowl with your mayo and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your dill mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables are cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully remove the skin[s] from the roasted garlic (they will be hot!), then chop roughly

Fluff the drained bulgur with a fork

Combine the roasted vegetables and chopped roasted garlic with the cooked bulgur, then add the chopped parsley and stir everything together – this is your roasted vegetable bulgur</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load the lettuce leaves with the roasted vegetable bulgur, shredded lettuce, and the crispy sumac haddock

Drizzle over the dill mayo and top with quick-pickled shallot

Sprinkle the remaining ground sumac all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
