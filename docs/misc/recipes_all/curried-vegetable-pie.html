<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock with the tomato wedges and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 20-25 min or until the potatoes and carrots are tender, stirring occasionally – these are your curried vegetables

Whilst everything is cooking, line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – these are your pie lids</p><br><br>
