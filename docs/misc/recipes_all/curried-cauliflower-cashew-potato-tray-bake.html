Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 min

After 20-25 min, add the cashew nuts to the tray and cook for 3-4 min further or until the nuts are toasted and the cauliflower is golden and crisp

Once the potatoes are done, add the spinach to the tray and return it to the oven for 1-2 min further or until it has started to wilt – this is your curried potato tray bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Spoon over the mango chutney and garnish with the toasted cashew nuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
