<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with the chopped creamed coconut and 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash, then slice the pak choi in half lengthways, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Slice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> red chilli into rounds (reserve for garnish!) and finely chop the rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the salmon fillets, skin-side down, and cook for 2-3 min until the skin has started to brown

Tip:<span class="text-danger"> </span>Cooking for 4? You may need 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the skin has browned, turn the salmon over and add the pak choi halves cut-side down and cook for 2-3 min until the pak choi has started to brown

Add the sugar snap peas, chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min further until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the tamari soy sauce and juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime to the pan and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the veg has softened and the salmon is cooked through – this is your salmon with tamari greens

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the remaining lime into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>wedges

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salmon with tamari greens with the coconut rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Pour over any excess juices from the pan and garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
