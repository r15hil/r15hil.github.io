<h4>Step 1</h4>

Add your pine kernel & seed mix to a large pan over a medium heat and cook for 2-3 min, stirring occasionally, until nicely toasted

Once done, transfer the toasted seeds to a food processor</p><br><br>

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until softened – these are your roasted tomatoes</p><br><br>
