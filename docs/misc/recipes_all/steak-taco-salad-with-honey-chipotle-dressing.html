<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then slice your tortillas in half and then into thin strips

Add the tortilla strips to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle them with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 7-8 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy tortilla strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season both sides with a pinch of salt, then once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</p><br><br>

Chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters
