<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper and add the chips to the tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crispy – these are your fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are in the oven, add your chicken thighs, soy sauce and ground smoked paprika to a bowl and give everything a good mix up then set aside

Add your cornflour, dried oregano and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to a shallow plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix well – this is your herbed flour mix

Tip: For a spicier burger, go heavy on the black pepper!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Remove the chicken thighs from the bowl and firmly press each one into the herbed flour mix, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 9-10 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic with your mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic mayo

Tip: Don't like raw garlic? Go easy!

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the warmed brioche base with the garlic mayo, then pile up the shredded lettuce and crispy fried chicken, topping with the warmed brioche lid

Serve the fries, diced tomato and any remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the salad dressing over the tomato and lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
