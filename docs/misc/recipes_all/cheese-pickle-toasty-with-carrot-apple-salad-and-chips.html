<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice half your carrot[s] finely, then dice half your apple[s] (skin on) and discard the core[s] (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a pot over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped shallot, diced carrot, diced apple and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add your ground allspice with 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span>[4 tsp] </span>brown sugar and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water with your chopped dates, Henderson's Relish and 3/4 of your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 12-15 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once done, set aside to cool slightly – this is your pickle

Tip: Cooling will help to thicken the pickle!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your bread roll[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted

Add the toasted bread roll[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and top with the grated cheddar and torn mozzarella

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until the cheese has melted and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining carrot & apple into matchsticks, discarding the core[s]

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your Dijon mustard, remaining cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar in a bowl – this is your mustard dressing

Add the carrot & apple matchsticks and salad to the mustard dressing and toss – this is your carrot & apple salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the cooled pickled over the cheesy bread roll and sandwich together – this is your cheese & pickle toastie

Serve the cheese & pickle toastie with the chips and carrot & apple salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
