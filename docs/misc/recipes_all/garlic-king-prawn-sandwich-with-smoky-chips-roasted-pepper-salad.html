<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with your half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 6-8 min – these are your smoky chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Slice your sweet pointed pepper[s] into rings (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chips have had an initial 6-8 min, move the chips to one side of the baking tray and add the pepper rings and onion petals to the other side with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 15-18 min or or until everything is golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) half your garlic

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (don’t like raw garlic? Go easy!) with your mayo in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and remaining ground smoked paprika to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your garlic king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>To build, spread the aioli on the toasted ciabatta base, then top with some of the roasted pepper & onion (you'll use the rest later!), garlic prawns and the toasted ciabatta lid[s] – this is your garlic king prawn sandwich[es]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic king prawn sandwich[es] with the smoky chips and salad to the side

Top the salad with the remaining roasted pepper & onion – this is your pepper salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
