<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Turn the wedges halfway through cooking to make sure they are browned all over!</p><br><br>

Add the chopped parsley, chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar in a large bowl

Once ready to serve, add the salad and the halved tomatoes to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once rested, slice the steak[s] on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak with the sweet potato wedges and tomato salad to the side

Drizzle the chimichurri all over the steak

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
