<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your pak choi and slice into quarters lengthways, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then set the browned chicken aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to the casserole dish with your ginger & garlic paste, Chinese rice wine, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and the juice of half your lime[s]

Add your chicken stock mix and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water, give everything a good mix up until the rice is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the browned chicken on top and put the dish in the oven, covered, for an initial 25 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had 25 min, top the dish with the pak choi quarters

Return the dish to the oven, covered, for a further 5 min or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your one-pot Hainanese-style chicken & rice with pak choi

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot Hainanese-style chicken & rice with pak choi in the middle of the table

Garnish with a lime wedge, your crispy onions and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)
