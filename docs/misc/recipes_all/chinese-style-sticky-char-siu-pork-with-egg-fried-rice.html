<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the grated garlic, 5 spice mix, ground paprika, hoisin sauce, honey, Chinese rice wine and soy sauce in a bowl

Add half the toasted sesame oil (save the rest for later!) and mix everything together – this is your char siu sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the pulled pork joint to an oven-proof dish draining away half of the juices, then pour over the char siu sauce

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate (reserve the pot) and spread it out flat to help it cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the pak choi in half lengthways

Add the halved pak choi to a baking tray lined with tin foil

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt, then set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork joint from the oven and discard the tin foil

Spoon the char siu sauce all over the joint and return it to the oven for 10-12 min further, basting it twice more until the sauce is thick and the pork is nicely glazed

Add the pak choi to the oven for 10 min or until the leaves have begun to crisp</p><br><br>

<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooled rice, blanched peas, remaining toasted sesame oil and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pot and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into the other side

Stir the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min or until resembling scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the char siu pork in half and serve with the egg fried rice and roasted pak choi to the side

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds all over the pork

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
