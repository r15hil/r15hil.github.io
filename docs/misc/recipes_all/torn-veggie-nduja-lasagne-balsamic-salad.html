<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your plant based 'Nduja and the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[275ml]</span> boiled water, your vegetable stock mix and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large pot of boiled water over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Break your lasagne sheets into medium-sized pieces and add them to the boiling water, stirring to separate the pasta pieces – this is your torn lasagne

Cook for 4-5 min, stirring from time to time to prevent the pasta from sticking, then drain the cooked lasagne</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the sauce has thickened, add the spinach and cook for 1 min or until wilted

Once wilted, add the cooked lasagne with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>
