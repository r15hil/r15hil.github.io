<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Peel and chop half the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges then finely dice the remaining onion

Drain the beetroot in a colander over the sink, then dice the drained beetroot very finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper, onion wedges and diced beetroot to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the veg is tender and slightly charred – this is your roasted veg

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Combine the red wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a large bowl with the diced onion – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and rinse under a little cold running water to cool slightly, then return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the chickpeas

Roll the lemon with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Crush the garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Peel lengths off the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop the tomatoes finely

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks, and strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Add the chopped tomatoes and half the ground sumac (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot with the bulgur wheat, then add the chopped parsley, chopped mint, quick-pickled onion (reserve the bowl!) and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tabbouleh</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the roasted veg is ready, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and set aside to cool slightly

Combine the courgette ribbons and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon in the reserved bowl with the roasted onion wedges, the remaining ground sumac, a little olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your marinated courgette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add half the roasted beetroot (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with the juice of the remaining lemon, the drained chickpeas and the peeled garlic

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until smooth – this is your beetroot hummus

Tip: Blitz with an ice cube for extra smooth hummus!

Add the wholemeal pittas to a toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the toasted pittas into triangles

Serve the beetroot hummus topped with the remaining roasted beetroot and crumble over the feta

Serve the toasted pitta triangles, marinated courgette and tabbouleh to the side and top with the roasted pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
