<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, heat a pot with a lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your soy sauce, half your ginger paste (save the rest for later!), your mango chutney and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water, then give everything a good mix up

Cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick curry-like consistency, then cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) then cut into wedges

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Combine the diced shallot with your mayo in a small bowl along with the lime zest (not sure about citrus? Try using less!) and a squeeze of lime juice and give everything a good mix up – this is your lime tartare sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your basa fillet[s] into strips

Add the basa strips and the remaining ginger paste to a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated basa

Add your cornflour to a separate bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and the remaining curry powder – these are your curried breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the marinated basa to the bowl with the curried breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up so the basa pieces are fully coated – this is your coated basa

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> [6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned – these are your fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and crusty, then carefully slice in half

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and remove whole outer leaves, then set aside for serving

Chop the remaining lettuce into quarters and remaining lime into wedge[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill your ciabatta with the lime tartare sauce, whole lettuce leaves, fish fingers, katsu sauce and half of the crispy onions – this is your fish finger x katsu sandwich

Serve the quartered lettuce to the side and dress with the remaining lime juice and remaining crispy onions

Serve the chips to the side and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
