<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your shallots in half

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Once the dish is hot, add your chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 40 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your coq au vin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your potatoes to a baking tray and prick them a few times with a sharp knife

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything's ready, remove the potatoes from the oven and crush them firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a plate

Add a couple of knobs of butter and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – these are your buttery crushed potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the bay leaf[ves] from the dish

Serve the coq au vin with the buttery crushed potatoes to the side

Tear the parsley roughly over the top

Dig in!</p><br><br>
