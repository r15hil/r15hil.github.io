<p>Boil a kettle

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the panko breadcrumbs, chopped spring onion, chopped coriander stalks and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweetcorn potato mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Divide the sweetcorn potato mixture into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12]</span> and press them firmly together to form patties

Heat a large, wide-based pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the patties to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp – these are your sweetcorn & potato cakes

Tip: You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

Scoop the avocado out of its skin using a spoon and slice finely

Wash the lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the lamb's lettuce between plates and top with the sliced avocado, sweetcorn & potato cakes and tomato salsa

Drizzle over the chilli lime dressing and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
