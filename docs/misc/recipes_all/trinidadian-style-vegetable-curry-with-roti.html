<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely (no need to peel)

Cut the green beans in half

Chop the potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (skin on) roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger and most of the diced red onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the curry powder, ground turmeric and ground allspice and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Drain the chickpeas

Once fragrant, add the sliced carrot, chopped potato, drained chickpeas, halved green beans and half the chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until coated in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Once the vegetables are coated in the spices, add the vegetable stock to the pan and reduce the heat to low

Cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the curry has thickened and the potato is fork tender – this is your Trinidadian-style vegetable curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the curry is cooking, top, tail and peel the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Stand the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stones and skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the diced mango with the remaining diced red onion and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Add the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your mango chow</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the roti and cook for 30 secs on each side or until brown and warmed thorough

Repeat with the remaining roti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Trinidadian-style vegetable curry with the warmed roti, mango chow and a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
