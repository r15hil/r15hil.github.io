<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] roughly

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Tip: Like it hot? Keep the seeds in!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your ginger & garlic paste to a small bowl with your rice vinegar, soy sauce, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar and stir it all together

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>of your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!) and mix it all together

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet chilli sauce base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the remaining cornflour to a large bowl with your cracked black pepper, your five-spice mix, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>salt

Mix until fully combined – this is your salt & pepper coating</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Roughly chop your Fable pulled mushrooms and add to the salt & pepper coating and give everything a good mix up until evenly coated

Once the pan is hot, shake off the excess coating and add the coated Fable mushrooms, then cook for 8-10 min, stirring occasionally, or until browned and crispy all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add your blanched peas to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and keep covered until ready to serve – this is your pea rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are crispy, add the chopped spring onions and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Transfer to a plate and reserve the pan – these are your salt & pepper Fable mushrooms

Wipe out the reserved pan and return to a medium-low heat

Add the sweet chilli sauce base to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until slightly thickened – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salt & pepper Fable mushrooms next to the pea rice

Drizzle with the sweet chilli sauce and season with a pinch of pepper

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
