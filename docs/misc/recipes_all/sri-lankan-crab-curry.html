<p><strong>Description:</strong> We've made a Sri Lankan classic: Crab Curry. While commonly a whole crab sits in a bowl, we've created a more manageable version with ready-picked crabmeat. The sweetness from the crab and creaminess from the coconut are paired with a zingy lime and cucumber salad and served over fluffy rice. </p>
