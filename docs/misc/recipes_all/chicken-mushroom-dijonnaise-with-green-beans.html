<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Season the chicken thigh skins generously with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, once hot, add the chicken (skin-side down) and cook for 10-12 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2] </span>piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper

Trim, then lay the green beans in the middle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the beans to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken skin is crispy, transfer the browned chicken to a baking tray (skin-side up) and reserve the pan

Add the green bean parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the baking tray with the chicken and put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with any remaining oil

Add the chopped mushrooms and sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until they're browned and caramelised

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have caramelised, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock and cook for 2-3 min or until it's starting to thicken

Once thickened, reduce the heat to low and add the crème fraîche and wholegrain mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!) and cook for 1-2 min until a smooth and thick sauce remains – this is your creamy mustard sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the cooked chicken thighs and serve them over the brown rice with the creamy mustard sauce and green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
