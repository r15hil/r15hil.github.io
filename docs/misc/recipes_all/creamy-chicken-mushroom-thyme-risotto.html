<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and cook for 4 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, transfer it to a plate and set aside until later

Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion and halved mushrooms and cook for 7-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Strip your thyme leaves and chop them finely, discard the stems

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped thyme and your arborio rice to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

Add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, return the browned chicken to the pan, stir in your soft cheese with half of the grated cheddar (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 5-7 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken, mushroom & thyme risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken, mushroom & thyme risotto and sprinkle over the remaining grated cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
