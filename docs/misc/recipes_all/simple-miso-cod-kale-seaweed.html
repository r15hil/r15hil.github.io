<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat the cod fillets dry and season them on both sides with salt

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the butter is foaming, add the cod fillets and cook over a medium-high heat for 4 min, turning once 


 Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked cod over the rice with the kale seaweed on the side 


Drizzle the cod with the miso mayo and garnish with the sliced spring onion


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
