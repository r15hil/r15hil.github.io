<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add the ciabatta rolls to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin batons

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the courgette batons and cook for 1-2 min or until they have slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the panko breadcrumbs and cook for 2-3 min or until they start to brown

Add the chopped parsley, crumble in half the feta, stir everything together and set aside – this is your gremolata</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add the garlic paste, 'nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and butter beans to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>Knorr chicken stock cube, tomato paste and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[280ml]</span> boiled water and cook covered for 1-2 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the spinach to the pan, stir it through the sauce and cook for 30 sec or until it has started to wilt – this is your saucy 'nduja & beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and tear the warmed ciabatta in half

Serve the saucy 'nduja & beans with the warmed ciabatta to the side and top with the gremolata

Crumble over the remaining feta and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
