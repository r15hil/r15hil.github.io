<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine a squeeze of lemon juice with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your zingy dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with the chopped cherry tomatoes

Add the zingy dressing and give it a gentle mix up – this is your zingy salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chorizo has crisped, reduce the heat to medium and add your ground smoked paprika, the chopped garlic, and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the drained linguine with a few splashes of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your clotted cream and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Tip: Add more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Squeeze in the juice of half your lemon[s] and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chorizo & lemon linguine

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chorizo & lemon linguine topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Serve the zingy salad to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
