<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat your grill to a high heat

Add your basmati rice, nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine half of your natural yoghurt with your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a generous pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl

Add the chopped salmon pieces and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your tandoori salmon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil (to avoid mess!) and drizzle with olive oil (to prevent the fish from sticking)

Add the tandoori salmon to the baking tray[s] and put it under the grill for 6-7 min or until the fish is cooked through and starting to char

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
