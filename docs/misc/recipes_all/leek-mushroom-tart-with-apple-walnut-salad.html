<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced chestnut mushrooms and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly golden and slightly softened, then transfer to a plate, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, chop your waxy potatoes into quarters

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the lower part of the oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden and crisp – these are your roasted potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your leek[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced leeks and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into 3 wedges per person

Once the leeks have softened, add the chopped garlic with 1 <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> knob[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of butter and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Remove the pan from the heat and add your soft cheese, half your cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!), a splash of cold water, a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – these are your creamy leeks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 piece per person

Add the pastry to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge with the tip of a sharp knife

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Spread the creamy leeks over the pastry (keep it within the borders!) then layer the cooked mushrooms over the top

Add the onion wedges to the tray[s] around the pastry

Put the tray[s] in the top part of the oven and cook for 15-18 min or until the pastry is cooked through, puffed up and golden – these are your leek & mushroom tarts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the tarts are cooking, slice your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into matchsticks (skin on)

Wash your salad, pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a large bowl with the apple matchsticks, walnuts, the remaining cider vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and black pepper

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your apple & walnut salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Carefully separate the roasted onion wedges into petals and add them to the apple & walnut salad

Serve the leek & mushroom tart with the apple & walnut salad and the roasted potatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
