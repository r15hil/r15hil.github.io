<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil and top with a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breast portions to a bowl with the chipotle paste, half the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your marinated chicken

Give everything a good mix up, then set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is marinating, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks, then peel and chop the garlic roughly

Add the chopped coriander and chopped garlic to a food processor with a pinch of salt and 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> cold water

Blitz until you're left with a green liquid – this is your coriander paste

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a lid with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the white long grain rice with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch it like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once toasted, add the coriander paste with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to the rice and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 8-9 min on each side or until cooked through and slightly charred (no pink meat!) – this is your chipotle chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Once the corn is tender, spread the mayo around each cobette with the back of a spoon

Crumble the feta over the corn and add a pinch of the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your elote corn

Cut the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chipotle chicken with the green rice and elote corn to the side

Squeeze the juice of a lime wedge over the green rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
