<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, cut the free range chicken thighs into strips

Add the chicken strips to a bowl with the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce then mix well until evenly coated

Add the cornflour and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated in the cornflour mixture – these are your coated chicken strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with the mayo in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper, then remove 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>outer leaves and set these aside for serving

Cut the remaining lettuce in half

Slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a separate small bowl – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken strips and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried free range chicken

Tip: Add more oil to the pan if it is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill your warmed brioche buns with the outer lettuce leaves, sliced tomato, fried free range chicken and sriracha mayo

Serve the chips and lettuce halves to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with the dressing and serve any remaining sriracha mayo to the side for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
