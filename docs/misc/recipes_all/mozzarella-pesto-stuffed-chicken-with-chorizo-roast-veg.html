<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and slice finely</p><br><br>

<p>Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of your chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Stuff the chicken pocket[s] with your sun-dried tomato pesto and sliced mozzarella</p><br><br>
