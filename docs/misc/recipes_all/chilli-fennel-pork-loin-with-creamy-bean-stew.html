<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then cover in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm

Mix 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>flour on a plate, with half your fennel seeds, half your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then drizzle your steak[s] with vegetable oil and press into the seasoned flour until well coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Set the coated pork aside for later

Top, tail and slice your leek[s] into rounds, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s] and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper, then boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once the butter has melted, add the leek rounds and cook for 3-4 min or until softened and lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chilli & fennel pork scaloppine

Once cooked through, transfer the chilli & fennel pork scaloppine[s] to a clean plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, add the sliced shallot and a generous pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly golden

Once lightly golden, add the chopped garlic and remaining fennel seeds

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add the drained beans and chicken stock and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has reduced by half – this is your bean stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, reduce the heat to low and add your crème fraîche

Gently stir it all together and cook for a final 1-2 min or until warmed through (don’t let it boil!) – this is your creamy bean stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy bean stew topped with the chilli & fennel pork scaloppine and the salad

Add a small drizzle of olive oil, season generously with black pepper and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
