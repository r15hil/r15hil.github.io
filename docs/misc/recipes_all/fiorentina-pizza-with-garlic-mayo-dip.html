<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato base evenly over the pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon, then top with the torn mozzarella, wilted spinach and chopped black olives, leaving a space in the centre

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 8-10 min or until the cheese has started to melt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 8-10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully crack your egg[s] into the centre of the pizza[s]

Return the pizza[s] to the oven for a final 5-7 min or until the egg white has set but the yolk is runny – this is your Fiorentina pizza

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and remaining chopped garlic with a generous pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Fiorentina pizza topped with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Serve with the garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
