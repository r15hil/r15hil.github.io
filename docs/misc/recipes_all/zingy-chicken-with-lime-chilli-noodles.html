<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half of your red Thai curry paste (save the rest for later!) and the juice of half your lime[s] and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast strips to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 10 min

Meanwhile, add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return them to the pot until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine your soy sauce in a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining red Thai curry paste and the juice of the remaining lime — this is your lime & chilli sauce

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has been cooking for 7-8 min, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped spring onion, halved green beans and half of your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 30 secs further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the lime & chilli sauce and cook for 1 min or until the green beans have softened slightly and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your zingy chicken with lime & chilli noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the zingy chicken with lime & chilli noodles

Tear over your coriander leaves and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
