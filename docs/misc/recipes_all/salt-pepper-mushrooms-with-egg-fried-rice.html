<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your cornflour to a bowl along with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar, a very generous pinch of salt, your five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together

Slice your portobello mushrooms into strips, then add to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until all the mushroom strips are coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the coated mushroom strips and cook for 6-7 min on each side until golden and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside – these are your crispy mushroom strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, trim, then roughly chop your spring onions into batons

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are crispy, add the spring onion batons, most of the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once done, transfer everything to a plate (save the pan!) and set aside until serving – these are your salt & pepper mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooled rice, blanched peas, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce then stir everything together until combined and cook for 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] onto the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salt & pepper mushrooms over the egg fried rice

Garnish with the remaining chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
