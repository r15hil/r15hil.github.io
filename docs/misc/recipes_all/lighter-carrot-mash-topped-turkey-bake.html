Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, carrot and garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and add the Henderson's relish and dried basil – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the turkey mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Grate the cheddar cheese

Once the turkey is browned, add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Season with a grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened – this is your turkey mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the turkey mixture thickens, return the drained potatoes & carrots to a low heat with 10g <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth

Tip: Don't worry if your carrot doesn't get completely smooth, it will add a nice texture to your mash!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the turkey mixture has thickened, transfer it to an oven-proof dish

Top with the mashed potato & carrot and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your turkey bake with cheesy carrot mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While your turkey bake is cooking, reboil a kettle

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the spring greens to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 2-3 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the turkey bake with cheesy carrot mash with the spring greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
