<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of pepper and cook for an initial 8 min or until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot with plenty of boiled water, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your soft cheese and roasted garlic paste to a bowl with half your grated Italian hard cheese and your traditional Italian pesto

Mix until completely combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the spinach has wilted – creamy pesto, chicken & spinach spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy pesto, chicken & spinach spaghetti in a bowl and top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
