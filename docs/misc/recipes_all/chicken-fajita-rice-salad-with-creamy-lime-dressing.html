<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut them into strips

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Add the pepper strips and onion wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the vegetables are tender – these are your roasted vegetables</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While everything is cooking, combine your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your fajita seasoning

Chop your chicken breast strips into smaller strips

Add the chicken strips to the fajita seasoning and give everything a good mix up until it's fully coated in all the spices – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and tear it into bite-sized pieces, then set aside

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the lime zest and the juice of half your lime[s]

Add half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt – this is your creamy lime dressing

Tip: Add a little<span class="text-danger"> </span>cold water if the dressing is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until the chicken is slightly blackened on the outside and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and add the remaining honey – this is your fajita-style chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the roasted vegetables, cooked brown rice and torn lettuce to a large bowl

Add the creamy lime dressing and give it a good mix up – this is your rice salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fajita-style chicken with the rice salad to the side and garnish with the chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
