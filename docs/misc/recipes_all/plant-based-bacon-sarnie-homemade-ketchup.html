Once the chips have been cooking for 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the bacon is cooking, add the halved ciabattas to the oven for 4 min or until warmed through

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread the ciabatta bases with some homemade smoky ketchup, then top with a lettuce leaf and the meat-free crispy bacon

Top with the ciabatta lids – these are your plant-based bacon sarnies

Chop the sarnies in half into triangles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stack the plant-based bacon sarnie halves and stick in a skewer to hold them in place

Serve with the black pepper chips, lettuce wedges and any remaining ketchup to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
