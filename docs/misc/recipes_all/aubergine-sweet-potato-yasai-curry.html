<p><strong>Description:</strong> Yasai translates to 'vegetable' in Japanese. Here our said vegetables are aubergine and sweet potato, which sit in a curry sauce enhanced by mango chutney and nigella seeds. Served with plain basmati rice and a fresh pickled ginger, baby leaf and peanut salad to cut through all that richness and give it a crunch! </p>

<h4>Step 8</h4>

Serve the&nbsp;aubergine and sweet potato&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;cooked rice and&nbsp;Japanese salad to the side&nbsp;


Spoon the curry sauce all over the vegetables and enjoy!
