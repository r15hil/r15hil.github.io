<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder, ground turmeric, tomato paste and drained chickpeas and cook for 1 min

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much of the water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Turn the heat down to low and stir through the chopped creamed coconut and your mango chutney

Add the chopped spinach, season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your chickpea, spinach & coconut curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chickpea, spinach & coconut curry over the brown rice

Garnish with your nigella seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
