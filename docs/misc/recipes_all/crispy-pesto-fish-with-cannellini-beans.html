<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, mix your panko breadcrumbs with your pesto and a drizzle of olive oil - this is your pesto panko

Add your basa fillet[s] to a tin foiled-lined baking tray (or two!) and coat evenly with the pesto panko

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the fish is golden and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pesto crusted basa fillet[s] over the cannellini bean stew

Garnish with the reserved basil leaves and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
