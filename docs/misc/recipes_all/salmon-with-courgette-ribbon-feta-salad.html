<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the bulgur wheat is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once golden, transfer to a plate</p><br><br>

Once done, drain everything and return to the pot</p><br><br>
