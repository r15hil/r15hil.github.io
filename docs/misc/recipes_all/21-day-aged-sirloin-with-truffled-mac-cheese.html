<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once cooked, drain the cooked macaroni and save a cup of the starchy pasta water

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pasta is cooked, stir your crème fraîche and grated cheddar cheese (save the grated Italian hard cheese for later!) through the drained macaroni

Add a generous splash of starchy pasta water and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cheesy macaroni</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Transfer the cheesy macaroni to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!), top with your grated Italian hard cheese and drizzle over your truffle flavoured oil

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your truffled mac & cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the truffled mac & cheese is cooking, chop your baby plum tomatoes in half

Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your sirloin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, rub them with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt

Once the pan is very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a clean plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the truffled mac & cheese is almost done, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Add the shredded lettuce and halved tomatoes to the bowl with the balsamic dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic salad

Slice the rested sirloin steak</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced sirloin steak with the truffled mac & cheese and balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
