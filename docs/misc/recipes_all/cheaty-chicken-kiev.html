<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut all the potatoes to roughly equal size (approx. 4cm chunks)

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place your hand flat onto each&nbsp;chicken breast fillet&nbsp;and slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic


Bash the garlic with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span>&nbsp;salt in a pestle &amp; mortar until you have a smooth paste


Melt 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;butter in a pot with the garlic paste


Once the butter&nbsp;has started to foam, remove the pot from the heat and set aside &ndash; this is your garlic butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with&nbsp;1-2 tbsp&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium heat


Once&nbsp;hot, add the chicken escalopes and cook for 5 min on each side, or <span class="text-highlight">until golden</span> brown and cooked through


Transfer&nbsp;them to a piece of kitchen towel


Season with salt and pepper&nbsp;&ndash; this is your breadcrumbed chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Drain and mash the broccoli and potatoes with a knob of butter and a splash of milk


Serve with the breadcrumbed chicken and the garlic butter to the side


Enjoy!&nbsp;</p><br><br>
