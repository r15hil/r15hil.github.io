<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, fill the toasted ciabatta with the spiced chicken, a dollop of garlic mayo and a handful of shredded lettuce – this is your spiced chicken ciabatta

Serve the herby roast potatoes to the side with the remaining shredded lettuce and drizzle over the remaining garlic mayo
