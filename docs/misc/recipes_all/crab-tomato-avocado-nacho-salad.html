<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Stack your tortillas and cut them into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Once crisped, set aside to cool a little

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon

Scoop out the avocado flesh using a spoon and dice roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with the diced tomato, diced avocado, half the chopped coriander (you’ll use the rest later!) and the juice of half the lime[s]

Add a large drizzle of olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your tomato & avocado salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo, lime zest, remaining chopped coriander, and a little crab meat (save most of it for later!) in a separate bowl

Season with a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your zesty crab</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the tomato & avocado salsa and gently mix it through – this is your tomato & avocado salsa salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Add the nachos to a bowl and spoon over the tomato & avocado salsa salad

Top with the zesty crab and sprinkle over the remaining crab meat and sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
