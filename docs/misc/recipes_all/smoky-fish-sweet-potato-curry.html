<h4>Step 1</h4>

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, ground coriander and ground turmeric and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add the chopped sweet potato and mix well until coated in the spices

Add the coconut stock and cook, covered, for 15-20 min or until the sweet potato has softened and the stock has thickened to a curry-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces

Once the sweet potato is almost cooked, add the chopped smoked basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, for a further 5 min or until the smoked basa is cooked through – this is your smoky basa & sweet potato curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky basa & sweet potato curry with the brown rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
