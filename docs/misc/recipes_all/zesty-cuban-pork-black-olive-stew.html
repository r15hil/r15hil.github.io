<p><strong>Description:</strong> Big, bold Cuban flavours have arrived in the form of this pork & orange stew. The mojo sauce is a Cuban staple â€“ orange juice & lime give a distinctively fresh, sweet flavour whilst romano peppers, oregano & olives add a savoury depth. Served with sunny turmeric rice & coriander. Cubamazing! (Naturally gluten-free, but unsuitable for coeliacs).</p>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> orange and 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)


Roll the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once thickened, add the black olives to the pan


Squeeze&nbsp;the juice of the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (watch out for the pips!) and 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime directly into the pan and stir through the orange and lime zest&nbsp;&ndash; this is your Cuban&nbsp;Pork Stew


Cut the remaining lime into wedges


Stir the chopped coriander through the cooked&nbsp;rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cuban&nbsp;Pork Stew with the coriander rice to the side


Garnish with the reserved&nbsp;coriander leaves and a wedge of lime


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
