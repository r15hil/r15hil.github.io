<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice, chopped ginger, a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your ginger rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, combine your chilli relish, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your salmon fillet[s] to a tin foil-lined tray (or two!)

Season the salmon with a pinch of salt and spoon the sweet chilli sauce over the top evenly

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 14-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through – this is your sweet chilli salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the salmon is in the oven, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and cut in half, separating the white bases and green tops

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pak choi white bases and the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has browned slightly

Add 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the pak choi green tops and your soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pak choi green tops have wilted

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the wilted pak choi – this is your sesame pak choi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet chilli salmon with the ginger rice and sesame pak choi to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
