<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine 2/3 of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) with your curry powder, ground paprika, honey and vegetable stock mix in a large bowl

Add the chopped garlic, the juice of half your lemon[s], a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your curry marinade

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped hake and red onion wedges to the curry marinade, give everything a good mix up and set aside

Meanwhile, rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Transfer the marinated hake and onion to an oven-proof dish with any remaining curry marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and beginning to brown – this is your curried fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your flaked almonds to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min or until lightly browned – these are your toasted almonds

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Add the toasted almonds to the drained brown rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your almond rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried hake over the almond rice with the chunky salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining natural yoghurt over the fish

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
