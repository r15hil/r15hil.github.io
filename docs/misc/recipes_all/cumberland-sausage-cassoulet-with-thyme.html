<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas 9


Add half&nbsp;of the smoked streaky&nbsp;bacon&nbsp;(you'll use the rest later) to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)


Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the bacon is very crispy


Once done, transfer the&nbsp;crispy bacon&nbsp;to kitchen paper (you'll use this for garnishing at the end) and keep the baking tray for later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
