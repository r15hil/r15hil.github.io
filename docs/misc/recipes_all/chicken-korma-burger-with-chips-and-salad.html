<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Cover the chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Season the flattened chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper and coat in half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once golden, transfer the browned chicken to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the browned chicken to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & korma sauce

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut side up, and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top your warmed brioche bun base with some of the salad, tomato slices, chicken & korma sauce and the warmed brioche bun lid – this is your chicken korma burger

Serve with the chips and remaining salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
