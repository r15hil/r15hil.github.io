<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables are tender, add the coriander stalks to the pan

Add your cultured coconut and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan – this is your Thai-style butternut squash & coconut curry

Cut the remaining lime[s] into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style butternut squash & coconut curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped peanuts, reserved coriander leaves, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
