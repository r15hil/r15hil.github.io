<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces

Add your cornflour and a pinch of salt to a bowl

Add the chicken pieces to the cornflour and give everything a good mix up so the chicken pieces are fully coated – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5 min on each side, or until nicely golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the golden chicken to a plate covered with kitchen paper and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a pot with 20g<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[30g] </span>[40g] </span>butter on a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your sriracha (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-purple">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Stir everything together until it combines and becomes a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper then slice into wedges

Chop your chives finely, then peel and grate your garlic

Combine your natural yoghurt, Dijon mustard, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and chopped chives in a bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the buffalo sauce pot to a medium heat

Once hot, add the golden chicken to the pot and toss until the chicken is fully coated in the sauce – this is your buffalo chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the buffalo chicken with the sweet potato fries, ranch dip and lettuce wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
