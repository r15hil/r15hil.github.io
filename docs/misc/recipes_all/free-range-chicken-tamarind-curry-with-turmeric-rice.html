<li>2 British free range chicken breast portions</li>

<li>130g white long grain rice</li>
<li>15g fresh root ginger</li>
<li>1/2 tsp ground turmeric</li>

<li>80g spinach</li>
<li>5g coriander</li>

</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with your ground turmeric, a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and curry powder and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml] </span>boiled water with your tamarind paste, chopped creamed coconut and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your tamarind stock

Once fragrant, add the tamarind stock to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your tamarind curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the sauce has thickened, add the spinach and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the spinach has wilted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Top the curry with the chopped chicken and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 10-12 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken tamarind curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and add half your nigella seeds (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your turmeric rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the free range chicken tamarind curry over the turmeric rice

Dollop your natural yoghurt over the top and garnish with the remaining nigella seeds and chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
