<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your meat-free mince to the onion with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and a generous grind of pepper

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and soy sauce in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Wash the sliced spring greens, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mince has browned, add half the chopped garlic to the pan (save the rest for later!) with the sliced mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your meat-free mince & mushroom pie mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 piece per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your pie lids</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pastry is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens with the remaining garlic and a small splash of cold water and cook for 2-3 min or until tender – these are your garlicky greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pie lids over the meat-free mince & mushroom pie mix with the garlicky greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
