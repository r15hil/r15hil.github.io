<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece (or two!) of tin foil

Scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to a baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the cobettes are in the oven, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Crush your crispy onions in their bag

Combine most of the chopped parsley (save a little for garnish!) and crushed crispy onions in a small bowl – this is your crispy onion crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the onion wedges to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add the sliced peppers and chopped garlic to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for a further 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, add your ground coriander, ground smoked paprika and tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 8-9 min or until the sliced peppers are tender and the sauce has thickened – these are your smoky peppers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the peppers are almost ready, remove the tray[s] with the cobettes from the oven and add your tortillas

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the tortillas are warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the corn from the cooked cobettes (careful they will be hot!), then sprinkle the crispy onion crumb over the top (for a little extra indulgence add a knob of butter!)

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the cobettes whole and don't add the crispy onion crumb!</span>

Divide the smoky peppers evenly between the warmed tortillas and top with the grated cheese and reserved chopped parsley, then season to taste and enjoy!</p><br><br>
