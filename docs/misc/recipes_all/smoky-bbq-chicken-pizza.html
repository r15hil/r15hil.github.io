<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Slice your chicken breast strips into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tomato paste to a jug with your smoked paprika, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and a generous grind of black pepper

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your BBQ sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
