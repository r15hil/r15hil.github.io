<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour over the boiled water so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until cool

Squeeze the water out of the spinach, then chop it roughly and reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [320ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [420ml]</span> boiled water

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your bulgur wheat and cook for 1 min or until it's lightly toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the stock, chopped spinach and sultanas to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the bulgur is tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the bulgur wheat is cooking, place your chicken breast portion[s] onto a clean chopping board

Sprinkle over your dried oregano and ras el hanout and season with a big pinch of salt

Press the spices into the chicken until thoroughly coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop your tomato[es]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Combine the chopped tomato and chopped mint with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your tomato & mint salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Crumble your Greek cheese into the cooked bulgur and give everything a gentle mix – this is your Greek cheese & spinach pilaf</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the spiced chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced spiced chicken over the Greek cheese & spinach pilaf with the tomato & mint salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
