<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the gnocchi with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Meanwhile, cut the cherry tomatoes in half

Chop the sun-dried tomatoes roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the halved tomatoes and chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and lots of black pepper

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the 'Nduja to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened to a tomato sauce-like consistency – this is your spicy 'Nduja & sun-dried tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

While the sauce is cooking, add the rocket leaves to a bowl with the balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and gently mix it all together

Peel the Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the crispy gnocchi with the spicy 'Nduja and sun-dried tomato sauce and serve the rocket salad to the side

Sprinkle half of the cheese shavings over the salad and the remaining cheese shavings over the gnocchi

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
