<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your cornflour with 30g<span class="text-purple"> [45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour in a large bowl with your soy sauce, half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> very cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your batter

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut the fillet[s] in half

Sprinkle both sides of the basa with flour until fully coated

Dip the floured basa into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated – this is your coated basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a medium-sized pot with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the remaining curry powder with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and your vegetable stock mix, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick curry-like consistency

Once thickened, add the sauce to a food processor and blitz until smooth – this is your curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your battered fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut side up, and put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine half your cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the salad to the bowl and gently mix together – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, add the battered basa to each toasted brioche base, then spoon over some of the curry sauce and top with a few of the chips and a toasted brioche bun lid – this is your chip shop fish & chip burger

Serve the chip shop fish & chip burger with the remaining chips, dressed salad and any remaining curry sauce to the side

Drizzle the chips with the remaining cider vinegar and enjoy!</p><br><br>
