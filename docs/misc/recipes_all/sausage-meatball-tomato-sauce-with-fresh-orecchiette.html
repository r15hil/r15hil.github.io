<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Roll your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) into 6<span class="text-danger"> </span>meatballs per person (clean hands are the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook, turning occasionally, for 4-5 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the orecchiette is cooking, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are starting to brown, add the sliced garlic, dried oregano and dried basil to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained orecchiette and half the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!) into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is nicely coated – this is your sausage meatball & tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage meatball & tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette topped with your grated Italian hard cheese and remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
