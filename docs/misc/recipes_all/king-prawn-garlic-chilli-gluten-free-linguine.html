<p>Remove from the heat and stir through the chopped parsley

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and chopped tomatoes to a bowl with a little drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the king prawn, garlic & chilli gluten free spaghetti in a bowl with the dressed salad

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with plenty of black pepper
