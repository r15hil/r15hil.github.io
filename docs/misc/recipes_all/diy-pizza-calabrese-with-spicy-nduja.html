<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking tray (or two!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your pizza sauce

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Slice your red chilli[es] finely into rounds

Pick your basil leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Break your ‘Nduja into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 per person

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press each dough ball in the centre and gently push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!), keep going until your base is slightly smaller than a side plate (you will make them bigger in the pan!) – these are your pizza bases

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (or two!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>(preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, carefully add a pizza base to the pan[s], pushing the dough out to the edge to help shape the crust

Tip: To pick up the pizza dough, gently flip it over the back of your hand to stop it ripping!

Add your pizza sauce to each pizza base and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon (be careful of the hot pan!) then cook the pizza base for 3-4 min or until the crust has started to puff up, then remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and slide the pizza bases onto the tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Repeat this process for the remaining pizza base[s]

Tip: Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!

Top the pizza bases with your dried oregano, torn mozzarella, ‘Nduja, chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced pepper and basil leaves

Drizzle the crusts with olive oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad  to a bowl with your balsamic vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your dressed salad

Serve the pizzas with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
