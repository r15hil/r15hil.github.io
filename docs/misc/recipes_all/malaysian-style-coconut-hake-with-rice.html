<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake to a bowl, sprinkle over half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and set aside until later – this is your marinated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the hake is marinating, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and then slice finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and chop the softer inner core[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Chop half your red chilli[es] roughly and finely slice the rest into rounds (save these for garnish!)

Put the chopped lemongrass core[s], shallot and red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into a food processor</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your ground almonds and remaining ground turmeric to the food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Add your soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of sugar

Pulse until you're left with a slightly chunky paste – this is your Malaysian-style spice paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the Malaysian-style spice paste to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tamarind paste with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the marinated hake and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the hake is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Once the hake is cooked, add the chopped creamed coconut to the pan and cook for 1 min further – this is your Malaysian-style coconut hake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Malaysian-style coconut hake with the basmati rice and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
