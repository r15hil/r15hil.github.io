<h4>Step 2</h4>

Once hot, add the sliced mushroom with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the egg from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled egg[s], then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg to the bowl

Tip: Use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!

Set the pot of boiled water aside (you'll use this later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil a full kettle

Once the mushrooms are golden, reduce the heat to medium and add half your ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer the mushrooms to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped spring onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the spring onion is softening, add your medium egg noodles to the reserved pot of water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pour 600ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[800ml] </span>[1L] </span>boiled water carefully into the pan and add your vegetable stock mix, soy sauce and remaining ginger & garlic paste

Add the spring onion batons, a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 min – this is your noodle broth

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the drained egg noodles in bowls and pour in the noodle broth – this is your spring onion noodle soup

Top the spring onion noodle soup with the pan-fried mushroom and halved egg and drizzle over your toasted sesame oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
