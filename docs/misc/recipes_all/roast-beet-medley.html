<p><strong>Description:</strong> Lentils (or poor man’s caviar as they’re known in France) are high in protein, low in fat and ever so versatile. This dish demonstrates their ability to wow. We’ve used half of the goats’ cheese as a warm dressing, along with the sweet roasted carrot and beetroot. </p>
