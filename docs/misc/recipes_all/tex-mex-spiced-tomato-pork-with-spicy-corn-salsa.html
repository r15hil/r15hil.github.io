<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Add the sliced shallot and sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a large bowl with your cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and a little drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled shallot & chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, transfer the cooked pork to a plate to rest and reserve the pan</p><br><br>
