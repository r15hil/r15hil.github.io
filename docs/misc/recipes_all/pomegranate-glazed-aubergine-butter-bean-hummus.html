<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the garlic has had 15 min, transfer it to a food processor (discard the foil!) and return the aubergine to the oven for 10 min further

Add your tahini to the food processor with the drained butter beans, ground cumin, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of your lemon[s]

Blitz until smooth – this is your butter bean hummus</p><br><br>
