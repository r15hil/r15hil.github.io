<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 390°F/ Gas 6

Put a large baking tray in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Remove the sausage meat from their skins and discard the skins

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage meat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go, then add the fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Go easy!)

Cook for 4 min or until the sausage meat is brown and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the tomato paste, a drizzle of olive oil, a splash of cold water and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl

Season generously with salt and pepper - this is your tomato sauce

Drain the mozzarella, tear it into bite-sized pieces, and pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove the heated baking tray from the oven and add the pizza bases

Spread the tomato sauce over the pizza bases with the back of a spoon

Dot the torn mozzarella over and put the tray in the oven until step 6</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pizza bases are in the oven, add the chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and baby kale to the pan with the sausage meat

Cook, covered for 1-2 min or until the baby kale is starting to wilt - this is your kale & sausage mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the kale has wilted, top the pizza bases with the kale & sausage mixture

Return them to the oven for 10-12 min or until the mozzarella has melted and the pizza bases are crispy - these are your fennel, sausage & baby kale pizzas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Chop the basil leaves finely

Add both to a bowl and drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a gentle mix up – this is your tomato & basil salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fennel, sausage & baby kale pizzas with the tomato & basil salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
