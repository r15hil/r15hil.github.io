<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onions in half, then finely slice lengthways until you end up with a pile of spring onion strips

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove the outer leaves and set aside, then shred the inner core</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a large bowl with a pinch of sugar – this is your gochujang dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the grated carrot to the gochujang dressing with the spring onion strips and shredded lettuce and give everything a good mix up – this is your gochujang slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is in the microwave, combine your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl with your rice vinegar, ginger & garlic paste and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your soy & sesame dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lettuce leaves, cooked rice, crispy chicken, gochujang slaw, soy & sesame dressing and your toasted sesame seeds in the middle of the table

To eat, add a spoonful of cooked rice to each lettuce leaf with some gochujang slaw and top with the crispy chicken

Drizzle over the soy & sesame dressing, garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and fold them up into a wrap

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
