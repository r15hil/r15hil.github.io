<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> [450ml]</span> cold water and your ground turmeric and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your turmeric rice</p><br><br>

Add your white wine vinegar, nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned and cooked through – this is your curried crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the chopped mint and coriander to the turmeric rice and stir it all together – this is your herby turmeric rice

Serve your curried crispy basa on top of the herby turmeric rice and the quick-pickled red cabbage to the side

Dollop the mango yoghurt over everything

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
