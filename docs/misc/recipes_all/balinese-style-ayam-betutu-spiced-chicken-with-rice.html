<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your red chilli[es] roughly (deseed if you can't handle the heat!)

Peel and roughly chop your garlic, ginger and shallot[s]

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin and remove the tough outer layer[s], then chop the softer inner lemongrass core[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garlic, ginger, shallot and lemongrass to a food processor with the ground turmeric, tamari soy sauce, creamed coconut and half your roasted peanuts (save the rest for garnish!)

Season with a pinch of salt, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blitz until you're left with a smooth paste – this is your ayam betutu paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chicken thighs to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Add 3/4 of the ayam betutu paste (you'll use the rest later!) to the chicken and give everything a good mix up until it's fully coated in the paste

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden – this is your Balinese-style ayam betutu chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered until serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has been in the oven for 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the remaining ayam betutu paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your mangetout and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Wash, then add your spinach to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until wilted – these are your spiced greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Balinese-style ayam betutu chicken with the spiced greens and cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining roasted peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
