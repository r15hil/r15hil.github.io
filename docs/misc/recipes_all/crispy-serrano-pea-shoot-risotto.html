<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Cut the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways and wash carefully to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan with 1-2 tbsp olive oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 3-5 min or until softened and translucent</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until the bacon is crispy

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the arborio rice to the softened leek and cook for 30 secs, stirring to coat the grains in oil

Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until it has almost evaporated

Add 1/3 of the chicken stock with a pinch of pepper

Once absorbed, continue to add the remaining stock, a little at a time, stirring almost constantly until the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once crispy, roughly chop your bacon into bite-sized pieces

Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the sliced spring onion, chopped mint and half of the pea shoots – this is your pea shoot risotto

Serve the pea shoot risotto in bowls and garnish with the crispy bacon and remaining pea shoots

Season with a crack of pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
