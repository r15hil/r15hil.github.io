<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is tender, add your soft cheese to the pan with the juice of half your lemon[s] and season with a very generous pinch of pepper – this is your chicken & squash casserole</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the chicken & squash casserole in bowls with the warmed ciabatta to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and the reserved thyme leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
