<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from the stems, discard the stems

Add half your blanched peas and half your pine nuts (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with your creamy single soy and mint leaves

Blitz until smooth – this is your creamy pea & mint sauce</p><br><br>

<p>Cut your lemon[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi is beginning to crisp, add your roasted garlic paste to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the creamy pea & mint sauce to the pan with your vegetable stock mix and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and add it to the pan with the remaining blanched peas and the juice of half the lemon[s]

Season with a grind of black pepper and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your creamy pea & spinach gnocchi

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Wash your rocket and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy pea & spinach gnocchi with the rocket to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining pine nuts and garnish with a lemon wedge

Drizzle over a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
