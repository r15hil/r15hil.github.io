<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper and soak the skewers in cold water

Chop the sweet potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped sweet potato to the tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate the ginger

Combine the grated ginger, soy sauce, mirin and half of the honey (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl – this is your yakitori sauce

Drain the tofu, pat it dry with kitchen paper and cut into large pieces

Trim, then cut half the spring onions into small, bite-sized pieces and slice the rest finely</p><br><br>

<p>Thread the chopped tofu pieces and spring onion pieces evenly onto the soaked skewers – these are your tofu skewers</p><br><br>

<p>Add the tofu skewers to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10-12 min or until the tofu is beginning to brown

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the mayo with a pinch of salt and a small splash of the rice vinegar in a small bowl – this is your Japanese-style mayo

Halve the cucumber lengthways then scrape out and discard the seeds using a teaspoon

Slice the cucumber halves finely and add them to a separate bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of salt – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the yakitori sauce to a pot over a medium heat and cook for 5 min or until thick and sticky – this is your sticky yakitori sauce

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tofu has had 10-12 min, remove the tray from the oven and brush the sticky yakitori sauce all over the skewers – these are your tofu yakitori skewers

Drizzle the remaining honey and black sesame seeds over the roasted sweet potato – these are your candied sweet potatoes

Return both trays to the oven for 4-6 min further or until they are both caramelised</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tofu yakitori skewers with the candied sweet potato and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the Japanese-style mayo over the sweet potatoes and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
