<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 8-10 min or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!), breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressing
