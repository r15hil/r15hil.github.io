<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

While the meat-free mince is cooking, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper to the pan (freshly ground is best!)

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free mince has started to brown, add the diced pepper, chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 2 min further

Tip: Add an extra drizzle of oil if it's looking a little dry!

Add your mirin, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened and sticky – this is your Chinese-style meat-free mince & green pepper stir-fry</p><br><br>
