<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Combine your red wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your vinaigrette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the diced chicken to the pan and cook for 4-5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve chicken stock mix and wholegrain mustard in 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [125ml]  </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your mustard stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es] of steamed brown basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Crumble your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for a further 2 min

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs further

Add your mustard stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your crème fraîche and give everything a good mix up, then cook for 2-3 min further or until the chicken is cooked through

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your chicken & mushroom fricassée

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set the chicken & mushroom fricassée, warmed rice and salad in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish the fricassée with the chopped spring onion, drizzle the salad with the vinaigrette and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
