<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced chestnut mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until they're starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely, separating the white parts from the green parts

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, stir the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, half of the soy sauce (save the rest for later!), and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml] </span>cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed, the rice is cooked and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
