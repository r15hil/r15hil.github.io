<p><strong>Description:</strong> This simple French flouring technique for cooking fish is somewhat brilliant, giving it a golden crust and perfectly steamed insides. We've served it simply with some potatoes and spring greens, so you can mop up the lovely creamy dill sauce.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up & slice into thin strips

Tear the chestnut mushrooms into bite-sized pieces (this saves time and creates an interesting texture)

Chop the dill</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the floured basa fillets and cook for 3 min on each side

Once cooked, remove the pan from the heat and set aside until serving

Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are crisped, add the white wine vinegar, clotted cream and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> milk to the pan

Crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> vegetable stock cube and cook for 2 min or until the sauce is slightly thickened

Add the chopped dill and season with a generous grind of black pepper â€“ this is your sauce bonne femme</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the basa fillets over the sauce bonne femme with the potatoes & spring greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
