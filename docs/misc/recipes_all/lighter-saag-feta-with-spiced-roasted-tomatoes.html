<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until really softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the onions are softening, add the cherry tomatoes to a tray with the cumin seeds and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tomatoes are softened and starting to burst – these are your spiced roasted tomatoes</p><br><br>
