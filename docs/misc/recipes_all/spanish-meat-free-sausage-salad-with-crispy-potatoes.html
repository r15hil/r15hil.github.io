<h4>Step 2</h4>

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper, onion wedges and your meat-free sausages to a baking tray

Drizzle everything with olive oil

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until everything is cooked through and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the drained potatoes to a separate baking tray and crush them gently with a fork

Add your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give them a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your crispy paprika potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!) and your white wine vinegar in a small bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sausages and roasted veg are cooked, cut the cooked meat-free sausages into pieces

Carefully cut the onion root off the roasted onion wedges, remove the skins and discard

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Place the salad in your bowl and top with the roasted pepper & onion and chopped meat-free sausages

Sprinkle over the crispy paprika potatoes and drizzle with aioli – this is your Spanish-style meat-free sausage salad with paprika potatoes

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
