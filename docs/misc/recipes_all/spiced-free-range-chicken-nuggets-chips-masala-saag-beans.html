<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with the nigella seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the free range chicken breast portions into bite-sized pieces

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a small bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate with half the garam masala and half the curry powder (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix together (this will make your breadcrumbs golden!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Season the chicken pieces generously with salt, then coat them in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

Add the breaded chicken nuggets to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden – these are your spiced free range chicken nuggets</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken and chips are cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, remaining garam masala, remaining curry powder and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water and the baked beans and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the beans have thickened, add the spinach to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to wilt – these are your masala saag beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced free range chicken nuggets with the chips and masala saag beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
