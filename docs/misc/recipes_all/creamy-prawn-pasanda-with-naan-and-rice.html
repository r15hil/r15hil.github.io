<p><strong>Description:</strong> Pasanda means "favourite" in Urdu, possibly because it's such a crowd-pleaser. To make this creamy curry, you'll add prawns to a rich, mildly spiced sauce, then serve with rice and garlic and coriander naan.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden then set aside for later (save the pan!)

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<p>Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s] and chop your tomato[es] into wedges

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onions have softened, add your ginger paste and chopped garlic with your garam masala and ground turmeric and cook for 4-5 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a little more oil if the pan looks a little dry

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the spices are fragrant, drain your king prawns then add them to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until coated in the spices

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add the vegetable stock with your ground almonds, tomato wedges, chopped creamed coconut and a pinch of sugar and cook for 3-4 min further, stirring occasionally, or until the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the prawns are almost done, add your garlic & coriander naans to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naans once they are out of the toaster

Once the prawns are cooked through, add your natural yoghurt and stir it all together – this is your creamy king prawn pasanda</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy king prawn pasanda with the brown rice and warmed naans to the side

Garnish with your toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
