<p><strong>Description:</strong> Pasanda means "favourite" in Urdu, possibly because it's such a crowd-pleaser. To make this creamy curry, you'll add free range chicken to a rich, mildly spiced sauce, then serve with rice and garlic and coriander naan.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden then transfer to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the spices are fragrant, increase the heat to high and add the chopped chicken and cook for 2 min or until coated in the spices

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your chicken stock mix with your ground almonds, chopped tomatoes, chopped creamed coconut and a pinch of sugar and cook for 8-10 min further, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naan once out of the toaster

Once the chicken is cooked through, add your natural yoghurt and stir it all together – this is your creamy free range chicken pasanda</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy free range chicken pasanda with the basmati rice and warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
