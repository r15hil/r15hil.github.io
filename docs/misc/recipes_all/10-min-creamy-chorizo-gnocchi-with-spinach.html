<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chorizo is cooking, add the gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once done, drain the gnocchi, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set the creamy chorizo gnocchi in the centre of the table, ready to share

Top with the grated Italian hard cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
