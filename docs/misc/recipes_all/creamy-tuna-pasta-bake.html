<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 6-7 min

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and chopped garlic and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Gradually whisk 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce

Add your vegetable stock mix and half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) to the béchamel sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheese sauce</p><br><br>

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your tuna pasta mix

Transfer the tuna pasta mix to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the tuna pasta mix evenly with the cheesy crunchy topping

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your creamy tuna pasta bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the creamy tuna pasta bake
