<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>30g panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>11g veg stock mix</li>
<li>2 burrata balls (200g)</li>
<li>35g grated Italian hard cheese</li>
<li>120g asparagus spears</li>
<li>15ml Chinese rice wine</li>
<li>25g hazelnuts</li>
<li>10g parsley</li>
<li>1 garlic clove</li>
<li>160g arborio rice</li>
<li>1 brown onion</li>
<li>1 lemon</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.3L]</span> boiled water  - this is your vegetable stock

Trim the asparagus stalks, discard any woody ends

Chop the asparagus stalks roughly until you're just left with the tips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the onion is starting to soften, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the roughly chopped asparagus stalks to the pan (save the tips for later!)

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20 min or until most of the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the risotto is cooking, bash the hazelnuts with a rolling pin

Tip: Keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop the parsley finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add the asparagus tips, grated Italian hard cheese and Chinese wine to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the asparagus is tender and the rice is cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the crushed hazelnuts and panko breadcrumbs with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden

Once golden, remove the pan from the heat, add the chopped parsley and lemon zest and give everything a good mix up – this is your hazelnut pangrattato</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon through the asparagus risotto and cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the asparagus risotto and top with the burrata

Pierce the burrata and drizzle with a little olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Spoon over the hazelnut pangrattato and garnish with a wedge of lemon

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
