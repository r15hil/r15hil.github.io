<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Crush your garlic cloves by pressing them down with the side of a knife (skins on!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breasts portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped potatoes, crushed garlic and rosemary leaves

Season everything with a pinch of salt and pepper, drizzle with vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the potatoes are golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has been cooking for 20 min, trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot and cover until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the beans are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir in your soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your sun-dried tomato sauce

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the cooked chicken finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced chicken over the sun-dried tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes, roasted garlic (watch out for the skins!) and green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
