<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Add the sliced radishes to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – these are your quick-pickled radishes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the cooked chicken thighs to a clean board and slice into strips (careful, they may be hot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Pat the sliced spring greens dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 5-7 min or until softened and caramelised

Once done, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your garlicky spring greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the spring greens are cooking, combine your smooth peanut butter with your honey and the remaining chopped garlic in a small bowl

Add your tamari soy sauce, the pickling juice from the radishes and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water then mix everything together – this is your peanut sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the brown rice topped with the caramelised red onion, quick-pickled radishes and garlicky spring greens

Top with the sliced chicken thighs and drizzle the peanut sauce all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
