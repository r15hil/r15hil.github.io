<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Chop the basa fillet[s] in half widthways

Coat the chopped basa evenly in your red Thai curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate with a pinch of salt

Press the chopped basa into the flour firmly to evenly coat all over

Meanwhile, peel and dice half your shallot[s]

Slice the remaining shallot finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the diced shallot to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy – this is your crispy shallot

Once crispy, transfer them to a small bowl or plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s] and roughly chop your peanuts

Add the grated carrot, chopped coriander and chopped peanuts to the quick-pickled shallot and mix to combine – this is your quick-pickled Asian-style slaw

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until coloured and charred on one side only

Once charred, remove and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa fillet[s], reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through and lightly crisp – this is your Thai-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, add a little sriracha mayo to the charred brioche base and top with the Thai-style basa, crispy shallot, some of the quick-pickled Asian-style slaw, then top with a charred brioche lid

Serve with the crispy fries, the remaining quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
