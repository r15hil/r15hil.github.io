<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Add the broccoli to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until starting to soften

Tip: Roasting the broccoli will help to remove excess moisture before adding to your sauce!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry and reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the leeks are cooking, grate the cheddar cheese

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Once the leeks have softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up

Gradually add the vegetable stock, 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> milk, the soft cheese and grated cheese and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency – this is your cheesy leek mixture</p><br><br>

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until they're tender

Once tender, drain the cooked peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the potato-topped broccoli & cheddar pie with the peas to the side
