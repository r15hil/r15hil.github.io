<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered until serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Meanwhile, soak the skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and grate the ginger into a large bowl

Add the larger soy sauce sachet<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to a bowl with the agave and half the rice vinegar (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your sweet soy marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop the chestnut mushrooms in half through the stalks

Add the halved chestnut mushrooms to the sweet soy marinade and give everything a gentle mix for 30 secs or until the mushrooms are evenly coated in the marinade – these are your sweet soy mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to medium

Carefully thread the sweet soy mushrooms onto the soaked skewers and add them to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Drizzle the remaining marinade over the mushroom skewers

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until they're tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the mushroom skewers are grilling, combine the sriracha with the remaining smaller soy sauce sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>,<span class="text-danger"> </span>remaining rice vinegar and a drizzle of vegetable oil in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Tip: Re-use the mushroom marinade bowl for less washing up!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Rinse the edamame beans under cold water

Wash the gem lettuce and chop into rough bite-sized pieces

Cut the cucumber in half and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, then slice the cucumber finely

Add the rinsed edamame beans, chopped gem lettuce and sliced cucumber to the dressing and give it a good mix – this is your crunchy edamame salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet soy mushroom skewers with the cooked sushi rice and crunchy edamame salad to the side

Drizzle any sauce from the tray over the skewers, sprinkle over the shichimi togarashi and enjoy!
