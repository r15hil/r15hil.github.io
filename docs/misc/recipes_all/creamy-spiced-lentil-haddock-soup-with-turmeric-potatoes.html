<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel your potato[es] and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic and chopped ginger with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water, your ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender – these are your turmeric potatoes

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry and reboil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Discard the outer green pods so you're left with the cardamom seeds

Add the cardamon seeds, cumin seeds and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the rinsed red lentils to the pan with 700ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water and your vegetable stock mix and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until the lentils are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lentils are tender, add your double cream with a generous pinch of pepper and mix it all together

Top with your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your creamy spiced lentil & haddock soup

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the turmeric potatoes to a bowl and spoon in the creamy spiced lentil & haddock soup

Top with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped coriander and a little drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
