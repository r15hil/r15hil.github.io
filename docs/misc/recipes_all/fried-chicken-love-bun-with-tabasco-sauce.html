<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-5 min <span class="text-danger">[6-8 min] </span>or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Add the halved brioche to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and golden

Set aside until serving and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chicken thighs (uneven number of chicken thighs? Cut the largest in half) to a bowl with the soy sauce then mix well until evenly coated

Add the cornflour, ground paprika and a generous pinch of salt to a plate and mix together with a fork until well combined

Place the soy coated chicken thighs onto the floured plate, pressing firmly to coat the chicken evenly on all sides, then set aside – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, add them to a baking tray and crush with the base of a mug to flatten them

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt to the tray and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 18-22 min or until the potatoes are crisp and golden – these are your smashed potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are in the oven, wipe any brioche bun crumbs out of the reserved pan (this is to prevent burning)

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 7-8 min on each side, or until the outside is crisp and golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, wash the gem lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove 2<span class="text-danger"> [4] </span>leaves from the gem lettuce and set aside, then cut the inner core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the honey and 2/3 of the TABASCO® Sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your hot honey

Add the mayo and the remaining<span class="text-danger"> </span>TABASCO® Sauce (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to another small bowl and mix until fully combined – this is your TABASCO® Sauce mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burgers, top a toasted brioche base with the TABASCO® Sauce mayo and two pieces of crispy fried chicken

Drizzle over the hot honey, then top with a gem leaf and the toasted brioche lid

Serve the burgers with the smashed potatoes and gem wedges drizzled with a little olive oil and a pinch of pepper to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
