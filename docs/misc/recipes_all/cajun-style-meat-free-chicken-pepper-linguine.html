<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add your ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano and ground cumin to the pan

Season with a pinch of sugar and salt, add a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>
