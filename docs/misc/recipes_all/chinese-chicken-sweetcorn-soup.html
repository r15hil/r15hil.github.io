<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook on both sides for 3 min or until lightly browned (don't worry it won't be fully cooked yet!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the&nbsp;garlic


Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the&nbsp;ginger


Dissolve the&nbsp;chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span>&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;&ndash; this is your&nbsp;chicken stock&nbsp;


Re-boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add both the&nbsp;chopped garlic&nbsp;and chopped&nbsp;ginger&nbsp;to the pan, reduce the heat to&nbsp;medium and cook for 1 min&nbsp;

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the wheat&nbsp;noodle nests&nbsp;with a pinch of salt to a&nbsp;separate pot and cover them with&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;until they're fully submerged


Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min until tender with a slight bite


Once done, drain and return to the pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil (this stops them sticking together)
