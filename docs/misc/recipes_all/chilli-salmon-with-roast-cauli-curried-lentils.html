<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your cauliflower into small florets (save the stem and leaves for later!), then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, a large pinch of salt and pepper and your ground turmeric

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min or until the cauliflower has softened and begun to char</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the cauliflower is cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Mix everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the cauliflower from the oven after the initial 12-15 min and add your salmon fillet[s] (skin-side down) to the baking tray[s] along with the reserved cauliflower stem & leaves

Add a drizzle of olive oil to the salmon and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then sprinkle half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over the salmon and return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 14-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through – this is your chilli salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion and garlic have softened, add the drained lentils and curry powder to the pan and stir everything together

Add your vegetable stock mix with 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – these are your curried lentils</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli salmon over the curried lentils with the roast cauliflower to the side

Dollop over the quick-pickled shallot, tear over your coriander and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
