<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, cut your paneer into small, bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the paneer cubes and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the diced tomato, garam masala and half of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for an initial 2-3 min or until the tomato has softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the tomato has softened, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for a further 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock, golden paneer, mango chutney and blanched peas and give everything a good mix up – this is your paneer & pea curry

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly, then transfer the paneer & pea curry to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Arrange the softened potato discs on top (careful – they will be hot!) and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), then put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your potato-topped paneer & pea curry pie

Once the pie has been cooking for 10 min, reboil a kettle

Trim the green beans, then add them to a pot and cover with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Place the potato-topped paneer & pea curry pie in the centre of the table and serve with the green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
