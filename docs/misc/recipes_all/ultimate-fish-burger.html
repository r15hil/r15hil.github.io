<p><strong>Description:</strong> We've called this fish burger 'ultimate' because, quite simply, it is. Crispy panko-crusted fish, melted mature cheddar, caper mayo sandwiched into a toasted brioche bun and skewered together. Served with crispy wedges and a classic lettuce and tomato side salad. This is the business. The fishy business!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the fish fillets in half widthways


Tap a few tbsp of flour out onto a plate, then beat the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and pour them into a shallow bowl


Pour the panko breadcrumbs onto a third plate, then coat the fish in flour, then egg and finally breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to coat them evenly and set aside&nbsp;

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut the brioche buns in half


Heat a large, wide-based dry pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely


Chop the capers finely


Combine the&nbsp;capers, mayonnaise and&nbsp;white wine vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half the spring onion (save the rest for the next step) - this is your caper mayo

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the wedges are nearly cooked, return the reserved pan to a high heat with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil&nbsp;


Once very hot, add the breaded&nbsp;fish and cook for 1 min each side until golden&nbsp;


Meanwhile, slice the cheddar&nbsp;in half lengthways&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the crispy fish to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!), season it with salt and add the cheese to half of the fillets


Put the tray in the oven for 4 min or until the cheese has just melted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble your fish burger with a little caper mayo over each brioche base with the cheesy fish atop, and the cheese-less fish over


Secure the top brioche with a skewer&nbsp;


Serve the salad, wedges and remaining mayo to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
