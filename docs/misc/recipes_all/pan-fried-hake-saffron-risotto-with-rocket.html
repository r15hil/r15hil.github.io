<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, stir the arborio rice and chopped garlic into the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil 


Add the Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 sec further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 1/3 of the stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed into the rice 


Continue to add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring more or less continuously for 20-25 min, until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half


Grate the cheddar cheese


Pat the hake fillets dry with kitchen paper and season both sides with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the hake, skin-side down, and cook for 4-5 min or until the skin has started to crisp


Flip the fish and cook for 1-2 min further or until cooked through


Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheese and a very large knob of butter


Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and season very generously with pepper (use much more than you normally would!) – this is your saffron risotto


Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saffron risotto in bowls, topped with a handful of rocket and the pan-fried hake


Season with a grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
