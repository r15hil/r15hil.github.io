<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your chicken thighs to the dish with a knob of butter and cook for 3 min or until very lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your lime[s] into quarters

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Drain your sweetcorn

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper, ground smoked paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and white long grain rice to the dish

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water with your chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the drained sweetcorn to a serving bowl with half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!), the juice of half the lime[s] and a drizzle of olive oil then crumble over your feta

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your esquites</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything's cooked through, remove the dish from the oven

Shred the cooked chicken apart using two forks and fluff the rice – this is your smoky coriander chicken & rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, garnish the smoky coriander chicken & rice with the remaining chopped coriander and the lime wedges

Serve the esquites to the side
