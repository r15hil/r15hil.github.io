<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and slice lengthways as thinly as you can

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the aubergine slices and cook for 3-4 min on each side (you may have to do this in batches!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is cooked, set aside and reserve the pan

Meanwhile, peel and dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened slightly but not coloured

Add 3/4 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for a further 1 min

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste, dried oregano and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock and half of the chopped basil (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 3 min until it resembles a thick bolognese sauce consistency – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!) then tear into chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add half of the cooked aubergine slices to an oven-proof dish in a single layer

Spoon over half of the tomato sauce and repeat so there are two layers of aubergine and sauce

Top with the torn mozzarella and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the cheese has browned – this is your aubergine parmigiana</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grind the reserved chopped basil, remaining chopped garlic and remaining grated Italian hard cheese with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a smooth paste

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop everything very finely!

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix well – this is your basil pesto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice each ciabatta into 4 slices and place onto a baking tray (or two!)

Spread the basil pesto evenly over the ciabatta slices

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5 min until the ciabatta is warmed through and crispy – this is your pesto bruschetta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine parmigiana has cooked, allow it to cool slightly before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the aubergine parmigiana with the pesto bruschetta to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
