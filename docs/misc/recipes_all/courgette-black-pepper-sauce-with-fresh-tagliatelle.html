<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a high heat

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs

Once hot, add the courgette discs to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min, turning halfway, until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add half your grated Italian hard cheese and half your cracked black pepper (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with the juice of half your lemon[s] and your vegetable stock

Give everything a good mix up – this is your courgette & black pepper sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir your drained tagliatelle into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is nicely coated – this is your courgette & black pepper sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the courgette & black pepper sauce with fresh tagliatelle with a lemon wedge to the side

Tear over your basil and garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and remaining cracked black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
