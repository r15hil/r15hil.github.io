<p><strong>Description:</strong> We're on a mission to make cooking times shorter and eating time longer. We love this simple method for cooking fish. You just tap it in flour and pan-fry. We've taken this dish to Thailand and served with hot basmati rice and a classic Thai green curry sauce with mushrooms, spring onion and coriander. Ready in 20!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Add the rice, 375ml <span class="text-danger">(750ml) </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the water is absorbed, checking occasionally</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place the coconut cream satchet<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water until submerged (this softens the naturally hard cream!)


Cut the mushrooms into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add some flour (approx. 4-6 tbsp) to a plate and pat the fish fillets dry


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil over a high heat


Add the fish to the flour and coat evenly on both sides, shaking off the excess

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add the fish and cook on both sides for 3 min


Tip: Your fish is cooked when it flakes easily and is opaque</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the fish to a plate for serving and return the pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil


Add the mushrooms and Thai curry paste and cook for 2-4 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the softened coconut cream with 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> boiled water and mix to combine thoroughly - this is your coconut stock


Add the coconut stock to the mushrooms and cook for a further 2-3 min until thickened into a thin curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> finely, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Once thickened, taste the curry sauce and add more with salt and pepper if needed


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked rice with a fork


Serve the fish over the rice with the curry sauce spooned over, garnishing with spring onion and coriander


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
