<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and dice your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Soak your skewers in water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick and with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add the diced sweet potato to the pan and cook for 5 min for until lightly browned

Once lightly browned, add the sliced shallot and cook for 3-4 min further or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has softened, add the chopped garlic, tomato paste and half your curry powder and mix everything together

Add your basmati rice with 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat the grill to medium-high

Chop your chicken thighs into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken to a large bowl with your mango chutney, remaining curry powder and a pinch of salt and pepper give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Thread the marinated chicken onto the soaked skewers and add them to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the chicken skewers and put the tray under the grill for 16-18 min, turning once halfway, or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your mango chicken skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your coriander yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop finely

Once the mango chicken skewers are almost ready, return the basmati rice to a low heat then add the chopped spinach and remaining chopped coriander

Stir everything together and cook for 1 min or until the spinach has slightly wilted – this is your saag sweet potato rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saag sweet potato rice in bowls and top with the mango chicken skewers and a dollop of coriander yoghurt

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
