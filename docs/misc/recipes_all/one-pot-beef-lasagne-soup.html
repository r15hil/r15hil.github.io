<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bring the pot to a boil then add your broken lasagne sheets to the pot one at a time (this prevents them from sticking together!)

Cook for 6-7 min or until the pasta is cooked, stirring from time to time to prevent the pasta from sticking – this is your one pot torn beef lasagne soup</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your soft cheese with half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and season with a pinch of pepper and a splash of milk – this is your cheesy cream mixture

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the one pot torn beef lasagne soup with the cheesy cream mixture

Garnish with the chopped parsley, the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
