<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands and cook for 3-4 min or until the mushrooms have browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are browning, chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your quick cook spaghetti and halved Tenderstem to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until everything is cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti & Tenderstem, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add your roasted garlic paste to the pan with the tomato paste and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your sun-dried tomato pesto, soft cheese and vegetable stock mix to the pan with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti & Tenderstem to the pan and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the sauce

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your creamy tomato, mushroom & broccoli spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato, mushroom & broccoli spaghetti

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
