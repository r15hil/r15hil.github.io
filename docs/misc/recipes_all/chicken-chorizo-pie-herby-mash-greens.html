<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined tray (or two!) and carefully score the pastry with a criss-cross pattern

Season with a grind of pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the pastry is golden, cooked through and puffed up – this is your pie lid[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your diced chorizo to the pan

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

After the chorizo has been cooking for 4-5 min, add the chopped chicken to the pan and cook for 6-7 min further or until browned all over

Boil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan with the chicken and give everything a good mix up, then add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> milk and your crème fraîche

Season with salt and pepper and cook for 6-7 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a double cream-like consistency

Stir through your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min further – this is your chicken & chorizo pie filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle and trim your green beans

Add the trimmed green beans to a separate pot and cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them!)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until tender

Once tender, add your blanched peas and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through

Drain the veg and set aside for serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the veg is cooking, chop your parsley & chives finely, including the stalks

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk and season with a pinch of salt

Mash together until smooth, then stir through the chopped parsley & chives – this is your herby mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken & chorizo pie filling with the herby mash and green beans & peas to the side

Top the filling with a pie lid

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
