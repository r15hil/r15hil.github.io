<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 5 min, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl to cool down quickly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut you potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (use baking paper to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up and set the tray aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a sheet of baking paper to your chopping board and sprinkle over a generous dusting of flour

Remove your sausages from their skins and combine to form 1 giant meatball per person, then flatten the meatball[s] into a circle (big enough to coat an egg) onto the floured baking paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Put the baking tray with the chips in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp

Peel the cooled egg[s]

Add the peeled egg[s] to the centre of your sausage meat circle[s]

Wrap the sausage meat around the egg and seal it tightly on all sides so that there aren't any gaps – this is your sausage-coated egg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs and curry powder to a plate and give it a good mix up – these are your spiced breadcrumbs

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a separate plate

Turn the sausage-coated egg[s] in the olive oil, shake off the excess, then add to the spiced breadcrumbs and press firmly until evenly coated all over – this is your breaded egg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the breaded egg[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 22-25 min, or until the sausage is cooked through – this is your spiced scotch egg

Meanwhile, combine your tomato ketchup and sriracha in a bowl – this is your spicy ketchup</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the tomato wedges, cider vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced scotch egg with the chips, tomato salad and the spicy ketchup to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
