<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later (save the pan!)

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<p>Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion[s] has softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic with your garam masala and ground turmeric and cook for 4-5 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a little more oil if the pan looks a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the spices are fragrant, add the drained chickpeas and tomato wedges and cook for 2 min or until coated in the spices

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add the vegetable stock with your ground almonds, chopped creamed coconut and a pinch of sugar and cook for 6-8 min further, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has almost thickened, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naan once out of the toaster

Once the sauce has thickened, add your natural yoghurt and stir it all together – this is your creamy chickpea pasanda</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chickpea pasanda with the basmati rice and warmed garlic and coriander naan to the side

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
