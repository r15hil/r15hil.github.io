<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges and slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the onion wedges and halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water - this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock to the pan and bring to the boil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook for an initial 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and add the spinach to the pan with the hake and cook, covered, for a further 2 min or until the spinach has started to wilt and the hake is cooked through â€“ this your curried hake, cherry tomato & spinach soup

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the medium egg noodles in a bowl and pour over the curried hake, cherry tomato & spinach soup

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
