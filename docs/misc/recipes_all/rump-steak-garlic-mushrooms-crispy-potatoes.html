<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add your portobello mushroom[s] to the tray[s]

Top the mushroom[s] with half of the chopped garlic (you’ll use the rest later!), a knob of butter and pinch of salt, then drizzle your Chinese rice wine evenly over the top</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the mushroom is tender and the potatoes are starting to crisp

Meanwhile, combine your panko breadcrumbs with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt on both sides</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat and once very hot add the seasoned steak

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Tip: Don’t be tempted to move the steak around too much in the pan – this will stop it from browning</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked steak to a plate to rest and reserve the pan with any cooking juices

Once the potatoes are starting to crisp, add your cherry tomatoes to the tray[s], then top the mushroom[s] with the breadcrumbs

Return everything to the oven and cook for a further 6-8 min or until the breadcrumbs are golden and the cherry tomatoes are starting to burst – this is your garlic portobello, crispy potatoes and roasted cherry tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are roasting, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, then add the spinach, return the pan to the heat and add your remaining chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted – this is your buttery spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the spinach is wilting, return the reserved pan with any cooking juices to a medium heat

Add a small splash of water and cook for 1-2 min until thickened to a gravy-like consistency

Add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your pan sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the steak with the crispy potatoes, roasted cherry tomatoes, buttery spinach and a garlic portobello to the side

Drizzle the steak with the pan sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
