<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add the couscous to a large heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and a pinch of salt then cover and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the shallot quarters and tomato wedges and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the ground turmeric, ground cumin and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock, drained chickpeas and black olives and cook for 2-3 min until the sauce has slightly reduced – this is your tagine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once reduced, top the tagine with the haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the fish is cooked through – this is your haddock, olive & turmeric tagine

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges and fluff the couscous with a fork ready for serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the haddock, turmeric & black olive tagine over the fluffed couscous

Tear the coriander over the top and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
