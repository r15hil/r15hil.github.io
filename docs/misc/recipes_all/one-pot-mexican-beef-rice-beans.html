<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the beef mince to the pan and cook for 2 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the white long grain rice, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), a pinch of salt and pepper and 175ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice and meat is cooked (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, stir through the drained black beans and cook for a further 2 min or until the beans are warmed through – this is your Mexican-style beef, rice & beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style beef, rice & beans topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt and the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
