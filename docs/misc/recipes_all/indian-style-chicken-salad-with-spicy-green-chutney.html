<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Pick a few coriander leaves from the stalks and set them aside for garnish, then chop your remaining coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the chopped coriander, garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a pestle & mortar and grind to a paste

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, the juice of half your lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your spicy green chutney

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into quarters, leaving the skin and root on (this stops them drying out and falling apart when roasting)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut a large piece of tin foil per person approx. the size of A4 sheets of paper

Add 2 chicken thighs to each piece of foil

Spoon the spicy green chutney over the chicken evenly

Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the chicken to form 1 sealed parcel per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chicken parcel[s] to one side of a baking tray and add the chopped sweet potato and onion quarters to the other side (cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!)

Drizzle vegetable oil over the chopped sweet potato and onion quarters and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-30 min or until the sweet potato is starting to crisp and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the juice of the remaining lime with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your zingy dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables and chicken are cooked, carefully cut the root off the roasted red onion, peel off the skin and discard the root and skin, then separate into petals

Remove and discard the skin from the cooked chicken then transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Add the red onion petals, roasted sweet potato and salad to a bowl and toss everything with the zingy dressing – this is your zingy salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the zingy salad topped with the pulled chicken and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves – this is your Indian-style chicken salad with spicy green chutney

Sprinkle the nigella seeds over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
