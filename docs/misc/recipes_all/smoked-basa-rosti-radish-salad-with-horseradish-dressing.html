<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and grate your potatoes

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add the grated potatoes and grated carrot to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the squeezed potato and carrot to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of vegetable oil and mix it all together – this is your rösti mix

Divide the rösti mix into 3 portions per person and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or 2!)

Place a separate piece of baking paper over the röstis, press down with an additional baking tray to flatten them, then put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the röstis are beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After the initial 20 min, remove the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and discard the baking paper covering the röstis

Return the tray to the oven and cook for a further 5-6 min or until crispy and golden – these are your crispy carrot röstis

Once cooked, season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the röstis are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked basa fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Add the shredded lettuce to a large bowl with the chopped shallots and sliced radishes

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper then toss – this is your radish salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and horseradish with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a little drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a small pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper – this is your zingy horseradish dressing

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, divide up the crispy carrot röstis equally, then top with the radish salad

Place the cooked smoked basa over the salad and drizzle the zingy horseradish dressing all over – this is your smoked basa & rösti radish salad with horseradish dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
