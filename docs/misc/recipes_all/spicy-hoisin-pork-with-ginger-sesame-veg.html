<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the greens are done, remove the parcel[s] from the oven and drain away any excess water

Add them to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil and stir to combine – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy hoisin pork with the sesame greens over the cooked rice

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
