<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Boil a kettle

Chop the chicken breasts portions into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped chicken in a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, coconut yoghurt, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garam masala and a pinch of salt – this is your marinated chicken

Transfer the marinated chicken to a baking tray (use baking paper to avoid mess!) and put in the oven for 6-8 min or until the chicken is slightly charred (you'll be cooking this in the curry later!)

Once done, set aside – this is your chicken tikka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is charred, turn the oven down to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Meanwhile, add the cashew nuts to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dice the cucumber finely

Add the diced cucumber to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper – this is your peppery cucumber salad

Drain the soaked cashews

Add the softened cashews, chopped ginger, garlic and onion to a food processor and blitz to form a paste – this is your cashew paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the whole cloves and cook for 1-2 min

Add the cashew paste and the tomato paste and cook for 8-10 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a little more vegetable oil if the pan is looking a little dry

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chicken tikka (and any juices) to the pan with the chicken stock mix and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Cook for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your creamy chicken makhani

Add the plain naans to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warm</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once hot, remove the warmed naans from the oven and add a knob of  butter alternative to each

Serve the creamy chicken makhani with the buttered naans and peppery cucumber salad to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cloves!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
