<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into rings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic clove[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skin[s], chop them roughly

Add the sliced pepper and chopped garlic to the dish with your ground smoked paprika, bay leaf[ves] and cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your chickpeas, then add them to the dish with your chopped tomatoes and black olives and give everything a good stir</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[585ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[765ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the dish to the oven for 10 min further or until the couscous is tender and the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Discard the bay leaf[ves]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, break the fish up into rough bite-sized pieces and tear your parsley and dill all over – this is your one-pot smoky Spanish-style basa & giant couscous stew

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Dig in!</p><br><br>
