<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes, then slice into thick discs

Add the sliced potatoes and bay leaf[ves] to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until very tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrots into batons

Peel and chop your shallots in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the halved shallots to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or 2!) and top with your duck legs and white duck fat (reserve the duck jelly for later!)

Add the carrot batons to the other side, then put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, drain and return to the pot with 2<span class="text-purple"> [3]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> knobs of butter, a splash of milk, a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth

Separate the egg yolk[s] from the white[s] by cracking your egg[s] over a small bowl and catching the yolk in the shell

Add the egg yolk[s] (save the whites for another recipe!) and chopped garlic to the mashed potatoes and give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your potato mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Transfer the potato mix to a small oven-proof dish (reserve the pot!) and discard the bay leaf[ves]

Press the back of a spoon into the mix to make rows of ridges

Put the dish in oven and cook for 15-20 min or until slightly crispy and golden – these are your duchess potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Trim your green beans

Once the duck legs have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the trimmed green beans

Return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven and cook for 10 min further until the duck legs are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pot clean and add your cornflour and a splash of cold water and mix until fully combined

Return the pot to a medium heat with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water, your beef stock mix, red wine paste, redcurrant jelly and the reserved duck jelly with a generous pinch of salt

Bring to the boil and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your red wine & duck jus</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the green beans have had 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your walnuts

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a final 3-4 min or until the walnuts are toasted – this is your roast duck, confit shallots, roast veg & toasted walnuts

Tip: Watch the walnuts like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roast duck legs with the confit shallots, and the roast veg topped with the toasted walnuts

Serve the duchess potatoes and red wine & duck jus all in the centre of the table

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
