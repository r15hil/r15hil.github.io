<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pod[s]

Grind the cardamom seeds, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!), ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a coarse paste – this is your spice paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Add your diced beef, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and spice paste to a bowl and mix thoroughly – this is your coated beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat (Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil)

Once hot, add the coated beef and cook for 2 min or until nicely browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the beef is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, then add your fish sauce – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the onion wedges to the dish and cook for 2 min further or until slightly softened

Add the coconut stock and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 45 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

After 45 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the pepper strips

Return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for 15 min further or until the sauce is thickened and the beef is tender – this is your Indonesian-style beef & pepper rendang</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indonesian-style beef & pepper rendang over the basmati rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
