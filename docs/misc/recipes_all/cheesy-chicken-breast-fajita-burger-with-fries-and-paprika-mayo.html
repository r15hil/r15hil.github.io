<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned

Transfer the browned chicken to one side of a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12-14 min, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced pepper, sliced onion, ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

Once softened, remove from the heat and set aside – this is your fajita spiced onion & pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the chicken has had an initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and divide the grated cheese equally over the top – this is your cheesy chicken breast[s]

Slice your brioche style bun[s] in half, then add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return it to the oven for 2-3 min until the cheese has melted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining ground smoked paprika to a bowl with your mayo and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your paprika mayo

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread a dollop of paprika mayo over the brioche base, then top with the cheesy chicken breast, fajita spiced onion & pepper and the brioche lid – this is your cheesy chicken breast fajita burger

Serve the fries and remaining paprika mayo to the side and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
