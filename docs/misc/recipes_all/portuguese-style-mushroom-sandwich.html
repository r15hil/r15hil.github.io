<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until caramelised

Once done, transfer the caramelised onions to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic, ground paprika, white wine vinegar, bay leaf[ves] and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your spicy marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice your portobello mushrooms into 1cm strips

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 10-12 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are almost cooked, add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until they're hot and crusty

Once done, carefully cut them in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are golden, add the spicy marinade and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs further, stirring until the mushrooms are coated in the sauce

Once the mushrooms are coated, remove the bay leaf[ves] – these are your Portuguese-style spicy mushrooms</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the sweet mustard mayo on the ciabatta base and top with the Portuguese-style spicy mushrooms and caramelised onions, then finish with the ciabatta lid

Serve the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
