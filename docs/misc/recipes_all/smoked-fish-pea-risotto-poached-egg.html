<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the smoked basa fillets into bite-sized pieces

Grate the cheddar cheese

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the blanched peas, grated cheese and chopped smoked basa to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until the fish is cooked through and the peas are tender – this is your smoked basa & pea risotto

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, chop the chives finely</p><br><br>

Crack the eggs gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel and season them with salt and pepper – these are your poached eggs</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the poached egg over the smoked basa & pea risotto

Garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
