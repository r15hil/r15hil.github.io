<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into quarters

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Zest the lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 4 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [8 tbsp]</span> butter with the lemon zest, chopped garlic, the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon, a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cook until the butter has melted – this is your lemon & garlic butter sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the sweetcorn cobettes, onion wedges, lemon wedges and the southern fried seasoning

Give everything a good mix up and return the tray to the oven for a further 10 min or until the potatoes are golden and the onion has started to soften

Meanwhile, drain the king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are golden, remove the tray from the oven and add the king prawns

Return the tray to the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your Cajun-style king prawn broil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cajun-style king prawn broil with the lemon & garlic butter sauce to one side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
