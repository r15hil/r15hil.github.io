<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large pot over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on)

Strip the sage leaves from their stems (discard the stems!) and roughly chop half of the leaves finely (keep the rest whole!)

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 450ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Rinse the puy-style lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the rinsed lentils to the pot along with the stock, bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce to medium-low and cook for 30-35 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, reduce the heat to medium and add a small splash of water to the pan, then cover with a lid

Increase the heat to medium high and cook for an initial 5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 5 min, remove the lid and add the trimmed green beans and remaining sage leaves to the pan, then cook, uncovered, for 5-7 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!), the beans are tender, and the sage is crisp

Once the lentils are tender, add the soft cheese to the pot, season with a pinch of salt and pepper stir to combine – these are your creamy apple & sage lentils</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy apple & sage lentils in wide bowls topped with the pan-fried chicken, green beans and crispy sage leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
