<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut into strips

Add the tofu strips to a bowl with half the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and give it a good mix up – this is your marinated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add half the cornflour to a plate with a pinch of salt, then add the marinated tofu and mix it all together until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and reserve the pan – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the broccoli into small florets and cut the stem<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the broccoli florets and stems with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly charred

Once slightly charred, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min

Drain the soaked noodles (reserve a little noodle water)

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the garlic has softened, reduce the heat to medium

Add the remaining soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and toasted sesame oil to the pan

Add the remaining cornflour with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the broccoli is tender with a slight bite and the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the broccoli is cooking, slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>finely

Once the broccoli is tender, add the drained noodles to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are coated in sauce – this is your soy broccoli stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of noodle water to the pan if it's looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the soy broccoli stir-fry in bowls with the crispy tofu on top

Sprinkle over the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
