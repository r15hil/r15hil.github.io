<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Wash your pak choi, and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop the roots from the pak choi, slice the white base finely and roughly tear the pak choi leaves in half

Chop your basil stalks finely, keeping the leaves and chopped stalks separate</p><br><br>
