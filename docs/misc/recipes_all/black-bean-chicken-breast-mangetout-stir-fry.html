<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with your soy sauce and cook for an initial 6-7 min, turning once, until golden

Once the rice is done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your black bean paste and Chinese rice wine with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your black bean stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is golden, add the chopped pepper, garlic, ginger and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your cornflour and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the black bean stock and mangetout to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the sauce has begun to thicken, the mangetout has slightly softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your black bean chicken & mangetout stir-fry

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the black bean chicken & mangetout stir-fry with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
