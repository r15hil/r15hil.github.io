<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, then once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your tomato paste and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water with your chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock mix, half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and the chopped garlic – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your spaghetti with your dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a drizzle of olive oil

Tip: You may need to break the spaghetti in half to fit the pan

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cherry tomatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 8-10 min or until starting to blister and char – these are your roast cherry tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the spaghetti is slightly charred, add the tomato stock a ladle at a time, stirring occasionally for 7-8 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite – this is your assassin's spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more water if it is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl with 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your balsamic dressing

Chop your black olives in half

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the chopped olives and salad to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic & olive salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the assassin's spaghetti and sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese

Top with the roast cherry tomatoes

Serve the balsamic & olive salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
