<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, cloves, dried cranberries, ground turmeric and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water with a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cranberry rice

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your chicken stock mix with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Once the shallot has softened, increase the heat to high and add your chopped chicken to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until beginning to brown

Meanwhile, add your samosas to a baking tray and put in the oven for an initial 8-10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once beginning to brown, add your curry powder and ground cinnamon to the pan with your ginger & garlic paste, tomato paste and a generous knob of butter and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the samosas have had an initial 8-10 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the naan[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the tray to the oven and cook for a final 3 min or until the bread is hot and the samosas are golden and crispy

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and add the spinach with half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and stir it all together until the spinach has wilted – this is your festive chicken curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the festive chicken curry with the cranberry rice, naan and samosas to the side

Drizzle the remaining natural yoghurt and your cranberry sauce over the curry

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
