Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

<p>Add the green tomato chutney, cider vinegar and wholegrain mustard to a small bowl


Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble your salad by dividing the lamb's lettuce, halved tomatoes and chopped apples between your bowls


Sprinkle over the shredded ham hock, croutons and toasted walnuts and drizzle over the chutney dressing
