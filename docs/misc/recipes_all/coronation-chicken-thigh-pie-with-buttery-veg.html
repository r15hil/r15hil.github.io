<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 5-6 min or until softened and lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, trim your green beans

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into thin discs

Add the trimmed green beans and carrot discs to a large piece of tin foil with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water, a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around the vegetables to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!) and add it to a baking tray, then set aside for later – this is your vegetable parcel</p><br><br>

<p>Boil a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add your diced chicken thigh to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>boiled water

Add your sultanas and stir it all together – this is your sultana stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 piece per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife

Crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through– these are your pie lids</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the vegetable parcel[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – this is your buttery veg

Once the chicken has browned all over, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your curry powder with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then add the sultana stock and mix it all together

Cook for 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the pastry is nearly ready, add your mango chutney to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min over a medium heat

Reduce the heat to very low and add your soured cream

Mix it all together and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through (don't let it boil!) – this is your coronation chicken pie mix</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coronation chicken thigh pie topped with a pie lid and the buttery veg to the side

Season with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
