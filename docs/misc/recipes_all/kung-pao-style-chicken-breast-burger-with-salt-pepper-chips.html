<h4>Step 1</h4>

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your salt & pepper chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden

Transfer the chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Kung Pao-style chicken</p><br><br>

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel and chop the orange[s] into small pieces, discard the peel

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with the shredded lettuce, orange pieces, mayo and a pinch of salt then mix well – this is your zingy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to the chip tray, and return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, pile a spoonful of zingy carrot onto each warmed brioche base, then add the Kung Pao-style chicken and top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your Kung Pao-style chicken burger

Serve the salt & pepper chips and remaining zingy slaw to the side

Garnish the chips with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
