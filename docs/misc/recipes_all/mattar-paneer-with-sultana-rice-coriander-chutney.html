<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add your basmati rice, sultanas and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your tomatoes roughly

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

Add half the chopped garlic, half the chopped ginger (you'll use the rest later!), the chopped tomatoes and garam masala and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes have started to soften

Once slightly softened, add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min further or until the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grind the remaining garlic and remaining ginger in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of sugar until you're left with a smooth paste, then transfer the paste to a mixing bowl

Add the chopped coriander, cider vinegar, half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the paste and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-copy-1672752693260-x200.jpg' alt='Step 7 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, stir through your blanched peas and browned paneer and cook for 1 min to warm everything through

Remove the pan from the heat and stir through half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) – this is your mattar paneer</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mattar paneer over the sultana rice

Dollop the coriander chutney and remaining natural yoghurt all over

Garnish with any remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
