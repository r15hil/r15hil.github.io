<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk to a large bowl and microwave for 15 secs or until slightly warm

Add your dried yeast to the bowl with the warmed milk and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix it all together and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once beginning to brown, add the chopped garlic and half the grated ginger (you'll use the rest later!) with your ground smoked paprika, hoisin sauce and soy sauce

Cook for 2 min or until fragrant and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Once fragrant, add the sliced spring onion and set aside for later – this is your char siu-style pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>milk (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a work surface with a dusting of flour

Toss the dough ball in the flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go and knead it, with floured hands, for 2 min or until smooth and softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut the kneaded dough ball into 3 pieces per person

Shape into balls and roll each out to approx. 10cm wide with a rolling pin

Divide the char siu-style pork between the rolled dough balls

Bring the edges of the dough together and firmly pinch until fully sealed – these are your buns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the buns to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), seal-side down

Brush the buns with milk and top with half your toasted sesame seeds (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-18 min or until the buns are puffed up and browned – these are your char siu-style pork buns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the buns are cooking, combine your rice vinegar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a medium bowl

Add your carrot, mooli & pink cabbage slaw mix and give it a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled slaw

Combine the remaining grated ginger and mayo in a small bowl with the remaining toasted sesame seeds and a small splash of water – this is your ginger mayo dip</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the char siu-style pork buns with the quick-pickled slaw and the ginger mayo dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
