<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the lamb mince to a bowl with a generous pinch of both salt and pepper and mix until combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the mince into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12] </span>and shape into meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2 min, turning occasionally, then transfer them to a plate and set aside

Return the pan to a medium-low heat, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until they're softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Cut the tomatoes into wedges

Dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onions are caramelised, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil to the pan

Increase the heat to high and add the garam masala and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add 2/3 of the chopped garlic and all of the chopped ginger and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the meatballs to the pan and add the stock, tomatoes, mango chutney and a very generous pinch of pepper, then reduce the heat to medium

Cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the sauce resembles a curry-like consistency and the meatballs are cooked through – this is your lamb meatball rogan josh

Add the plain naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, cut the green beans in half

Heat a small pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the yellow mustard seeds and cook for 1 min or until they begin to pop

Add the green beans, a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of water and cook covered for 3-4 min, then add the remaining garlic for a final 1 min – these are your mustard seed green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lamb meatball rogan josh over the cooked basmati rice with the mustard seed green beans and warmed naan to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
