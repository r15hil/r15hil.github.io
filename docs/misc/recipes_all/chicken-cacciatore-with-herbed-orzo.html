Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skin is golden and crispy (you'll finish cooking them later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Add a knob of butter and most of the chopped parsley to the drained orzo and season with a pinch of salt – this is your herbed orzo</p><br><br>
