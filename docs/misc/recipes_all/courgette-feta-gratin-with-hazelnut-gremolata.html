<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Top, tail and slice the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into rounds (approx 0.5cm thick)

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into discs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato discs and courgette rounds to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sprinkle them with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 15-20 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves

Top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 6-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the leek is softening, peel and finely chop the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Once the leek has softened, add the chopped garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for a further 1 min

Add the vegetable stock and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your leek sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the softened courgettes and potatoes (reserve the tray!) to an oven-proof dish

Add the leek sauce, crumble in most of the Greek cheese (save some to go on top!), add a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a gentle mix up

Crumble the remaining Greek cheese over the top, then put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is golden – this is your courgette & Greek cheese gratin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the hazelnuts to the reserved tray and put in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Chop the toasted hazelnuts roughly (careful they may be hot)

Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped parsley, lemon zest, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped hazelnuts in a small bowl

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon and 1.5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>olive oil – this is your hazelnut gremolata

Cut the remaining lemon into 2<span class="text-danger"> [4] </span>wedges

Wash the baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the courgette & Greek cheese gratin to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve with the baby leaf salad and a lemon wedge to the side and sprinkle the hazelnut gremolata all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
