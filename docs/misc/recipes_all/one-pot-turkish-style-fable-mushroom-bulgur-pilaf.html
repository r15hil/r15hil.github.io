<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your tomatoes into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your Fable pulled mushrooms to the dish with your dried oregano, bay leaf[ves] and baharat and cook for 1-2 min until very lightly browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into rings

Add the pepper rings and tomato wedges, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir

Put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and set aside for later – this is your tomato stock

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your bulgur wheat and tomato stock

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 15 min further – this is your one pot Turkish-style Fable mushroom bulgur pilaf

Chop your mint leaves finely, discard the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After a further 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand (keep the lid on!) for another 10 min

Tip: This will help to make the bulgur fluffy!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, fluff the one pot Turkish-style Fable mushroom bulgur pilaf with a fork

Dollop your natural yoghurt over the top and scatter the chopped mint all over

Sprinkle over your ground sumac
