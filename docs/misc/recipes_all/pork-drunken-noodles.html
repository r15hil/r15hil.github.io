<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the rice noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soak for 10-12 min or until the noodles are tender

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Once the vegetables have softened, add the soy sauce to the pan with  the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, the chopped herbs and drained noodles and give everything a good mix up – these are your drunken noodles

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the drunken noodles in bowls

Garnish with a lime wedge and sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
