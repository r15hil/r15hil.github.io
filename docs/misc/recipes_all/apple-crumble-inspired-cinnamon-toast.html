<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Busy morning ahead? Some of this recipe can be prepped ahead (if you like!)

Make steps 2-3 the night before and store in an airtight container, then finish the rest in the morning, and enjoy within 24 hours

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your chopped pecan nuts and coconut flakes to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a plate and set aside – these are your toasted nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>
