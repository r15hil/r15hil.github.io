<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium high heat


Bash the cashew nuts lightly to break them up (keep them in the bag so you don't lose them!)


Once hot, add the crushed cashews and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over


Transfer the cashews to a plate and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the rice has been cooking for 10 min, add the green beans to the pot and cook, covered, for 5 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the hake, skin-side down, and cook for 4-5 <span class="text-highlight">min</span> or until the skin has started to crisp


Flip the fish so that it's skin-side up and cook for 1-2 <span class="text-highlight">min</span> further or until cooked through


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, transfer to a plate and remove the pan from the heat


Tip: the pan will be hot enough to cook out the spices!


Add the curry powder and <span class="text-highlight">ground</span> turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat


Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> water and give everything a good mix up 


Add the clotted cream and cook for 1 min or until melted – this is your creamy curry sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hake over the rice with the green beans to the side


Spoon the creamy curry sauce over the hake and garnish with the cashew nuts


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
