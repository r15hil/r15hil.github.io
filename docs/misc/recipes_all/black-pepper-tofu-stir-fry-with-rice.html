<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the torn tofu to a large bowl with most of your cornflour (save a little for later!), your five-spice mix and umami seasoning and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 8-10 min, turning occasionally or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy tofu

Once done, transfer the tofu to kitchen paper and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely on the diagonal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat and once hot, add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, reduce the heat to medium and add your ginger paste and cracked black pepper (not a fan of pepper? Just add a little!) with the chopped garlic

Cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the black pepper tofu stir fry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the sliced spring onion
