<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and onion wedges with a pinch of salt

Add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3-5 min on each side or until golden, stirring the vegetables occasionally</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Add your sun-dried tomato pesto and tomato paste – this is your pesto stock

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is golden, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your orzo and pesto stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Stir the orzo occasionally to prevent it from sticking!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Once cooked, remove the cooked chicken from the pan (keep the orzo cooking!) and transfer it to a clean board, then shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the orzo is tender, add most of the grated cheese (save some for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up

Season with salt and pepper – this is your red pepper & pesto orzo

Tip: Add a splash more water if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your basil roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pulled chicken over the red pepper & pesto orzo

Garnish with the chopped basil and remaining grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
