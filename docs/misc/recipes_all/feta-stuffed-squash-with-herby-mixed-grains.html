<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Meanwhile, add the chopped parsley, diced onion and half the honey-Dijon dressing (save the rest for later!) to the couscous and stir everything together – this is your herby couscous</p><br><br>
