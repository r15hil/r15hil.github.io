<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, lets get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the noodles are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your lean pork mince with your ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your mangetout in half roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed)

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Once the noodles are almost cooked, add the halved mangetout and cook for 1 min or until just cooked with a bite

Once cooked, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and keep to one side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the lean pork mince has browned, add your soy sauce, red chilli relish and the juice of your lime[s] and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1 min further or until thickened and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry

Crush your peanuts in the bag with a rolling pin and sprinkle them over</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your sweet chilli lean pork wholewheat noodles and garnish with the chopped spring onion, crushed peanuts and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
