<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and roughly slice your brown onion[s]

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your garam masala, ground fenugreek, ground turmeric and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan

Add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Add a splash more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped green beans and tomato to the pan and cook for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until everything is tender – this is your fragrant vegetable sambar

Tip: You may need to add a splash of water if the sambar is looking too thick!</p><br><br>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Chop your coriander stalks finely

Once cooked, stir the chopped coriander stalks through the fragrant vegetable sambar</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant vegetable sambar with the basmati rice to the side

Dollop over your cultured coconut and garnish with the coriander leaves
