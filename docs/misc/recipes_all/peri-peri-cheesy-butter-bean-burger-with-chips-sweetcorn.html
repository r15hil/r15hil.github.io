<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the blended beans, tomato paste, panko breadcrumbs, peri peri spice mix (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), vegetable stock mix and grated onion to a bowl and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your bean mixture

Divide the bean mixture into 1 flat patty per person

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil (or two!)

Add a small pinch of salt and scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your cheddar cheese

Add the sliced red onion to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion

Add your ground paprika to a bowl with your mayo – this is your paprika mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 whole outer leaf per person and set aside for serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the torn lettuce leaves to a bowl and mix with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger top a warmed brioche bun base with some of the paprika mayo, a reserved lettuce leaf, some of the quick-pickled red onion, a peri peri butter bean patty, the sliced cheddar and a warmed brioche bun lid

Serve with the chips, corn, remaining paprika mayo, salad and the remaining quick-pickled red onion to the side

Sprinkle over your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
