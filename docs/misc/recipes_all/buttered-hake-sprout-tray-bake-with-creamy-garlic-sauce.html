<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then cut them in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways, then into batons

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, chopped parsnip and halved Brussels sprouts to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-18 min or until the potatoes are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your soft cheese to a measuring jug with your dried thyme, roasted garlic paste, Chinese rice wine and vegetable stock mix

Mix until fully combined, then add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water

Stir it all together and set aside – this is your sauce

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, add the halved Tenderstem and hake fillet[s] to the tray[s]

Tip: Nestle the hake in between the vegetables!

Top each hake fillet with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper, then return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a final 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your buttered hake & sprout tray bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the hake is cooked, put the sauce in the microwave for 1-2 min or until hot – this is your creamy garlic sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, set the buttered hake & sprout tray bake in the middle of the table, ready to share

Drizzle the creamy garlic sauce over the fish and season with a generous pinch of pepper
