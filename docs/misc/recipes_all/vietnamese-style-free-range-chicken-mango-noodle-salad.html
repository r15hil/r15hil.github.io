<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min, turning occasionally until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water until fully submerged and stir for 10 sec until the noodles separate

Set aside to soak for 4 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the soaked noodles, then run them under cold water for 10 sec until slightly cooled, then set aside to drain further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the noodles are softening, combine the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, Sriracha hot chilli sauce (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar and soy sauce with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Tear the outer leaves of your lettuce into large, bite-sized pieces then shred the inner core

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them roughly, discarding the stalks

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Chop the mango flesh into small bite-sized pieces, discarding the stones</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add torn lettuce, drained noodles, chopped mango and most of the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a large bowl with the dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your noodle salad

Transfer the crispy chicken to a clean board and shred apart into roughly bite-sized pieces using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the noodle salad topped with the crispy chicken

Garnish with the chopped herbs and remaining chopped chilli (remember to go easy if you don’t like spice)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
