<p><strong>Description:</strong> The chicken breasts in this recipe are sliced in two and pan-fried in curry spices, meaning they take less time to cook. The rice and sweet potato are cooked together in the same pan, allowing you time to whiz up your fresh coriander and lime chutney, which is zingy and salsa-like.</p>
