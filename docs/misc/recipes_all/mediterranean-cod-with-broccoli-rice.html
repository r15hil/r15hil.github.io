<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Pat the cod fillets dry with kitchen paper and season them with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add the cod fillets to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Add the broccoli brown rice to a large, heatproof bowl and put the bowl in the microwave for 2-3 min or until piping hot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the tomato stock to the pan with the vegetables and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – these are your Mediterranean vegetables</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Serve the Mediterranean vegetables with the heated broccoli brown rice to the side

Top the Mediterranean vegetables with the pan-fried cod

Tip: Spoon any remaining butter or juices from your pan over the cod!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
