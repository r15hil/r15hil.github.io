<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary, and if you like your steak well-done, it may take you a little longer than 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature and boil a kettle

Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, add a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the seasoned steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once done, transfer the steak[s] to a clean plate and set aside to rest

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Add your couscous to a large heatproof bowl with your diced apricots, ras el hanout and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add the beef stock, then cover and set aside – this is your fruity spiced couscous</p><br><br>

<p>Crumble your feta into rough bite-sized pieces

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a generous knob of butter

Once melted, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant – this is your harissa butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the fruity spiced couscous with a fork

Add the salad, flaked almonds and a drizzle of olive oil to the bowl and mix it all together – this is your couscous salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak over the couscous salad

Drizzle the harissa butter over the steak and sprinkle the feta on top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
