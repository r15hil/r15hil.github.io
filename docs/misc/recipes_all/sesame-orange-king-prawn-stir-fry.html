<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the prawns are cooking, combine the juice of the orange[s], rice vinegar, honey and soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your orange sauce

Once the sesame prawns are cooked through, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan</p><br><br>
