<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the pepper half[ves] to the side of the tray and top with a small drizzle of olive oil

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 10-15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully remove the cooked pepper half[ves]

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a final 10-15 min or until the fries are crispy and golden brown

Top each cheesy ciabatta base[s] with a cooked pepper half, hollow side down

Place a ciabatta lid on top – this is your Greek cheese ciabatta[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the Greek cheese ciabatta[s] and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 4-5 min per side, checking occasionally or until the ciabatta is golden and the cheese has melted – this is your Greek grilled cheese & pepper toastie</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the Greek grilled cheese & pepper toastie in half and serve with the fries and salad to the side

Top the salad with the tomato wedges, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Serve with a dollop of mayo and a remaining lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
