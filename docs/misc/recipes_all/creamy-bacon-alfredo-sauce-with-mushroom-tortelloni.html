<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the bacon lardons and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Add the sliced garlic to the pan with the bacon and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water and stir in the soft cheese – this is your creamy stock

Add the creamy stock and half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan with the bacon and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken – this is your creamy bacon Alfredo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, wash the spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tortelloni and chopped wilted spinach to the creamy bacon Alfredo sauce and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy bacon Alfredo tortelloni topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
