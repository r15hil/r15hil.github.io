<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, pat the lamb rump<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> dry with kitchen towel and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb rump and cook for 4-5 minutes, turning frequently, or until browned on all sides

Once browned, transfer to a baking tray and set the pan and tray aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Push the lamb rump to one side of the tray and add the drained potatoes

Drizzle the potatoes in vegetable oil and any remaining oil from the pan and season with a generous pinch of salt

Crush the potatoes lightly with a fork and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the lamb is pink and blushing on the inside and the potatoes are starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the garlic. Chop the parsley roughly, including the stalks

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly

Add the garlic, parsley and mint to a food processor with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), capers, Dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your mint salsa verde</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tray has been in 20-25 minutes, transfer the lamb to a plate, cover and set aside to rest

Increase the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Return the potatoes to the oven for 10 minutes further or until golden and crisp – these are your roasted crushed potatoes

Meanwhile, boil a kettle</p><br><br>
