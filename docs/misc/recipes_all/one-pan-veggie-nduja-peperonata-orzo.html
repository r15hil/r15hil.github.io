<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced peppers and onion with a generous splash of cold water and cook for 15 min or until starting to caramelise

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it from burning</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil a kettle

Once the onion and pepper is starting to caramelise, reduce the heat to medium and add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar with your red wine vinegar

Cook for a further 30 secs or until slightly jammy</p><br><br>
