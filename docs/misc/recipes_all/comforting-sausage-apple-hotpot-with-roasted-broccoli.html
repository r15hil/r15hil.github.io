<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Cut your sausages into rough bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the sausage pieces to the pan and cook for 3-5 min or until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the sausages have browned, add the sliced onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and add your Henderson's Relish – this is your Henderson's stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has slightly softened, add the apple pieces to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the apple has started to brown

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated

Stir in 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and add the Henderson's stock and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened, then transfer it to an oven-proof dish – this is your sausage & apple hotpot filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potato discs are done, carefully arrange them (beware, they will be hot!) and the remaining apple slices over the top of the sausage & apple hotpot filling

Reserve the baking tray and keep the tin foil!

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is bubbling, the potatoes are golden and the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sausage & apple hotpot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the hotpot is in the oven, cut your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem and leaves

Add the broccoli florets to the reserved baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until beginning to char</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage & apple hotpot with the roasted broccoli to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
