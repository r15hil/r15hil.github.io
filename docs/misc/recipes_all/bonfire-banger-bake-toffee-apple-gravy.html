<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Boil a kettle

Unroll the puff pastry and add it to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Tip: Use 2 trays if you're cooking for 4!

Add the Catherine wheel sausage<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the centre of the puff pastry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the pastry is golden and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your bonfire banger bake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, slice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely (skin on), discarding the core

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the sliced apple with 1.5 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the apple caramelises, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Once caramelised, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up until a sandy paste forms

Gradually stir the beef stock into the sandy paste and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your toffee apple gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Heat a separate pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat

Once boiling, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 2-3 min or until tender

Once tender, drain and return the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the bonfire banger bake in half and serve with the mash and spring greens to the side

Drizzle the toffee apple gravy all over and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
