<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your butternut squash cubes and drained chickpeas to a baking tray (or two!)

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add half your roasted peanuts to a pestle & mortar with your ginger paste, chopped basil and half the chopped mint and chopped coriander (you’ll use the rest later!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and grind to a thick paste

Add your toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and mix it all together – this is your Thai-style pesto

Tip: Alternatively, use a food processor!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the juice of your lime[s] and your soy sauce in a bowl – this is your chilli & lime marinade

Once the squash has had 15-20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle the chilli & lime marinade all over

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 10-15 min further or until the squash is cooked through and the chickpeas are crisp – this is your chilli roasted squash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the squash is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the sliced shallot, salad, remaining chopped mint and remaining chopped coriander to the cooked bulgur and give it a good mix up – this is your bulgur salad

Roughly chop the remaining roasted peanuts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli roasted squash over the bulgur salad and drizzle the Thai-style pesto all over

Garnish with the chopped roasted peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
