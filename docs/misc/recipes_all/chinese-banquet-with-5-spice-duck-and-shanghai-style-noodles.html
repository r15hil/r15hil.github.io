<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chilli flakes to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your chilli oil

Trim, then slice your spring onions in half, then into thin strips

Slice your cucumber[s] in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds with a spoon then slice into matchsticks, discard the seeds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Separate your duck leg[s] from the white duck fat and duck jelly (you'll use these later in the recipe!) and add to a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), then set aside until later

Add your duck leg[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Coat the duck with your five-spice mix and season with a generous pinch of salt, then put the tray in the oven for 28 min or until the duck is golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

While the duck is in the oven, wash, then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add your hoisin sauce to a small bowl with a tiny splash of cold water to loosen it</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your spring greens, then rip the leaves off, discard the tough stalks, and layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to a large baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a large drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your udon noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water

Set aside to soak for 4-5 min

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!

Drain the soaked noodles

When the duck has 7 min left, add the sliced spring greens to the oven for 6-7 min or until crispy – this is your crispy 'seaweed'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat the reserved large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with the reserved duck fat & duck jelly

Once melted, add your ginger & garlic paste and soy sauce with a pinch of sugar and cook for 1-2 min, then add the pak choi white base and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained udon noodles to the pan with the pak choi green tops and cook for 2-3 min or until the noodles are coated in sauce

Place the Chinese-style pancakes (still in their bag) in the microwave and heat for 30 secs to steam

Once ready, remove the roasted five-spice duck leg[s] from the oven, shred using two forks and mix half the shredded duck (save the rest for later!) through the noodles – these are your Shanghai-style noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the remaining shredded duck with the cucumber matchsticks and sliced spring onions in your steamed pancakes with hoisin sauce

Serve the Shanghai-style noodles in a bowl with the chilli oil (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) drizzled over and the 'seaweed' in a bowl to the side – this is your Chinese banquet with 5-spice duck and Shanghai-style noodles

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
