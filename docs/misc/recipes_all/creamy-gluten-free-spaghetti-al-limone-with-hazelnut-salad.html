<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your gluten free spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the spaghetti is cooking, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Combine half the lemon zest (save the rest for later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a large bowl with your honey and the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon honey dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add the halved tomatoes and salad to the lemon honey dressing with the toasted hazelnuts and give everything a good mix up – this is your hazelnut salad</p><br><br>

Give everything a good mix up until the sauce coats the pasta

<h4>Step 8</h4>
