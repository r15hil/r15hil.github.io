<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Add the basa fillets to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and season with a pinch of salt</span>


Spread the horseradish cream over the basa fillets, then top with the panko breadcrumbs

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the fish is cooking, heat a small pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat


Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until softened 


Add 50g <span class="text-danger">[100g]</span> butter and cook for 1 min or until melted


<span class="text-highlight">Add the chopped sage and a small pinch of salt and stir it all together, then remove the pot from the heat – this is your sage butter</span></p><br><br>

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender


<span class="text-highlight">Once cooked, drain the green beans and add them to the sage butter - these are your sage-butter green beans</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the roasted squash and garlic to a pot or large bowl and crush everything up using a fork or masher (it's ok to have lumps!) – this is your crushed squash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Serve the crispy horseradish fish over the crushed squash with the sage-butter green beans to the side</span>


Drizzle over any remaining sage butter
