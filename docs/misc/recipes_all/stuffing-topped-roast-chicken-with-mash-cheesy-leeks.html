<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your Chantenay carrots to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray with your dried thyme, a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until tender and golden

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the carrots are cooking, add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then transfer to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan

Meanwhile, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and dried sage to a bowl with a pinch of pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your stuffing mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top the browned chicken with the stuffing mixture, then press it down gently to coat the surface of the chicken

Transfer the sausage stuffing topped chicken to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing</p><br><br>

<p>Heat the reserved pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once softened, add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour and stir for 30 secs

Gradually add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[90ml]</span> milk, 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[90ml] </span>boiled water, soft cheese and grated cheese, then season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – these are your creamed leeks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the leeks are thickening, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour to a measuring jug with your chicken stock mix, Marmite and onion marmalade

Gradually stir in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[300ml] </span>of boiled water, then transfer to the microwave for 2 min, stirring halfway, or until the gravy has thickened – this is your onion gravy

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, then season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced sausage stuffing topped roast chicken over the mash with the roasted carrots and creamed leeks to the side

Pour the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
