<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for an initial 20 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] to the pan (skin-side down) with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 min on each side until sealed but not cooked through

Carefully peel the skin off the salmon and discard it, then cut the salmon fillet[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>squares per person

Place 2 salmon pieces side-by-side onto each piece of pastry and spoon most of your traditional Italian pesto over the salmon (save some pesto for later!)

Brush a little milk around the edges of the salmon-topped pastry square</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top each salmon-topped pastry square with another pastry square and seal the open ends together by pressing the edges down with a fork

Add the parcel[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and brush the top[s] with milk

Sprinkle the parcel[s] with your nigella seeds and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your pesto salmon en croûte</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the salmon en croûte is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the potatoes are starting to crisp, remove them from the oven and add the chopped garlic

Give them a good mix up then return to the oven for 4-5 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Melt 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium-low heat

Once melted, add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms

Add 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk gradually and whisk for 2-3 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your white sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop roughly

Add the chopped spinach and remaining pesto to the white sauce and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your creamed spinach</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pesto salmon en croûte with the creamed spinach and crispy potatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
