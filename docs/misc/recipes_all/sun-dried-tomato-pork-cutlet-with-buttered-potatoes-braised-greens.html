<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle and take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the onion has softened, add the sliced garlic and sliced spring greens with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and a generous pinch of salt, then cook for 10 min or until tender – these are your braised greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cover your pork loin steak[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened to approx. 1cm in thickness

Season on both sides with a generous pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork cutlet

Once cooked through, transfer the cooked steak to a clean board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, reboil half a kettle

Add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-8 min or until the potatoes are very tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the pork is resting, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste with 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your balsamic sun-dried tomato pan sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, add a knob of butter with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – these are your buttered potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested pork cutlet[s] on the clean board

Serve the sliced pork cutlet over the braised greens and drizzle over the balsamic sun-dried tomato pan sauce

Serve the buttered potatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
