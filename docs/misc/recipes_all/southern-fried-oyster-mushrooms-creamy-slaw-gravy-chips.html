<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the coated mushrooms to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crispy

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, season the cooked mushrooms with a pinch of salt – these are your southern fried oyster mushrooms

Serve the southern fried oyster mushrooms with the creamy slaw, fries and gravy to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
