<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your basa fillet[s] and top with the lemon rounds and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the fish is starting to brown

Combine the chopped garlic and the juice of the remaining lemon[s] in a bowl with a large knob of butter

Season with salt and pepper – this is your lemon butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the basa is starting to brown, add the lemon butter and cook for a further 2 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your lemon butter basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemon butter basa with the tomato & spinach pesto rice to the side

Spoon over any excess lemon butter

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
