<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then add it to a pot with your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, transfer it to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice half your red chilli[es] finely into rounds

Cut the remaining red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain your pineapple, reserving the pineapple juice

Combine the chopped garlic and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>pineapple juice in a bowl with your tamari soy sauce and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy)

Add the juice of half your lime[s], 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your pineapple glaze

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the glazed pineapple rings (reserving the glaze) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until lightly charred

Once lightly charred, add your cashew nuts to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until lightly toasted – this is your charred pineapple & cashew nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>
