<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs

Add the red onion wedges and courgette discs to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10-15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Add your toasted sesame seeds, dried thyme, ground cumin and sumac to a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt

Grind to a paste then add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the lemon zest and give everything a good mix up – this is your za'atar paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once crisped, transfer the crispy chicken to the tray[s] with the roasting veg (skin side up)

Spread the za'atar paste over the crispy chicken and roasted courgette

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables are tender – this is your za'atar chicken & roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Combine your natural yoghurt with with a squeeze of lemon, your roasted garlic paste and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped herbs to the cooked rice and stir it all together - this is your herby rice

Once everything is cooked, carefully cut the roots from the red onion and remove the skins</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the garlic yoghurt over one side of your plate and top with the za'atar chicken & roasted veg

Serve with the herby rice and a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
