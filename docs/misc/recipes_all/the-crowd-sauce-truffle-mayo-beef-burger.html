<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Remove 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [30g]</span> butter from the fridge and set aside to soften slightly

Peel and cut your sweet potato[es] into fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sweet potato fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and your ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until cooked through and golden – these are your smoky sweet potato fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your mayo, truffle oil, your white wine vinegar and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your truffle & black pepper mayo

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then add it to a separate bowl with your dried oregano and softened butter and give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic & herb butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Season your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince and shape them into 1 patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the fries have been in for 15-20 min, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the beef patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 3 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the patty[ies] are cooking, cut your brioche bun[s] in half and spread them with the garlic & herb butter

Add to a baking tray (or two!), butter-side up, and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until golden – this is your garlic & herb brioche bun[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once browned, flip the beef patty[ies] and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Cover loosely with a lid (or some tin foil!) and cook for 2-3 min further or until the cheese has melted and the patty[ies] are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, wash your gem lettuce and set the leaves aside for serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the base of the garlic & herb brioche bun with some truffle & black pepper mayo

Build your burger by topping the base with some lettuce leaves, a cheesy patty and some more truffle & black pepper mayo then top with the lid

Serve with the smoky sweet potato fries to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
