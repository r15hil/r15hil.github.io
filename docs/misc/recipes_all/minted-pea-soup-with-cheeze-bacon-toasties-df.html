Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the baking tray[s] from the oven

Add one rasher of smoked streaky bacon to each ciabatta base (leave the remaining rashers on the tray) and layer your cheese flavour slice on top

Add both the ciabatta bases and lids (cut side up) to the other side of the tray[s], then return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheeze has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaf[ves]

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your minted pea soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Sandwich the ciabatta bases and lids together and cut them in half diagonally – these are your cheeze & bacon toasties

Serve the minted pea soup in bowls with the cheeze & bacon toasties to the side

Break the remaining smoked streaky bacon into shards and sprinkle over the soup

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and enjoy!</p><br><br>
