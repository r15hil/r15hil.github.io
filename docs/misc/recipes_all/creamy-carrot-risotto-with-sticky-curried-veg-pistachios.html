<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle

Top, tail, peel and roughly chop your carrot[s]

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped carrot to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> of cold water and a small pinch of salt and scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel[s]

Add the halved Chantenay carrots and chopped parsnip to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with half your curry powder (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together

Add the foil parcel[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

While the onion is softening, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water – this is your vegetable stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, the remaining curry powder and ground turmeric and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine and your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

While the rice is cooking, chop your pistachio nuts roughly

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the initial 25 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and remove the foil parcel[s]

Drizzle your honey over the roasted veggies

Add the chopped pistachio nuts to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 2-3 min or until the pistachios are lightly toasted and the vegetables are golden and sticky – these are your sticky curried veg & toasted pistachios

Tip: Watch the pistachios like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the softened carrots in the foil parcel[s] to a food processor, then add your soft cheese and blitz until smooth – this is your carrot purée

Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the carrot purée, the chopped coriander and a pinch of salt – this is your creamy carrot risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy carrot risotto and top with the sticky curried veg

Sprinkle the toasted pistachio nuts on top and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
