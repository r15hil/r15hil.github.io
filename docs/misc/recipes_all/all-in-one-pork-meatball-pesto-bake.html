<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Once everything has</span> been in the oven for 20 min, remove the <span class="text-highlight">tin foil</span> and the meatballs from the dish


Tip: Use the foil to pop the meatballs onto, to avoid extra washing up!


Give everything a good stir until the spinach has wilted into the sauce


<span class="text-highlight">Return the meatballs to the dish and return to the oven for 10-15 min further or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!)</span></p><br><br>
