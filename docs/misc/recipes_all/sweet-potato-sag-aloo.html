<p><strong>Description:</strong> Spicy yet wholesome, Sag Aloo is a traditional Indian side dish of spinach and potatoes that makes for the perfect midweek meal. Here weâ€™ve swapped potatoes for sweet potatoes, which are less starchy and better for slow energy release, and exchanged the spinach for seasonal spring greens.</p>
