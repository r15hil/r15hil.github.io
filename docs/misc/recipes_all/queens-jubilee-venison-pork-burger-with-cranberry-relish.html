<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into thick chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 min, then drain (reserve the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely dice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> shallot

Peel and finely slice the remaining shallot

Chop the dried cranberries roughly

Cut the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the white wine vinegar with half<span class="text-danger"> [all]</span> the wholegrain mustard and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the remaining wholegrain mustard for another recipe!

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar and whisk together – this is your mustard vinaigrette

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chips are in the oven, add the reserved pot to a medium heat with a small drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened, then add the chopped cranberries, 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> boiled water, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> orange and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix everything together and cook over a medium-low heat for 15-20 min or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your cranberry & orange relish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the remaining orange, then cut each slice in half

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the chips have 10 min left, carefully remove them from the oven, shake and turn them and return them to the oven until crispy and golden

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of  vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the venison & pork patties, press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until the burgers are cooked through and charred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the venison & pork patties with the twice cooked chips and gem wedges to the side

Top the gem wedges with the sliced orange and sliced shallot and drizzle the mustard vinaigrette over the top

Dollop the cranberry & orange relish over the patties and serve the truffle mayo to the side with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
