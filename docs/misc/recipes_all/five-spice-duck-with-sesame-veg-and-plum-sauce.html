<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Separate your duck legs and add to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the duck is cooking, cut your pak choi in half lengthways

Top, tail and slice your carrots into batons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the pak choi halves and carrot batons to a large piece of tin foil with a generous pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around the vegetables to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your soy sauce, five-spice mix, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a medium bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your five-spice marinade

After the duck has been in the oven for 15 min, top with half the five-spice marinade (you'll use the rest later!) and return the tray to the oven for a further 15 min or until golden and crispy – this is your five-spice roasted duck</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

After 15 min, remove the tray with the vegetables from the oven and open up the parcel

Add your toasted sesame oil and sprinkle over the toasted sesame seeds

Return the tray to the oven and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the vegetables are tender – this is your sesame roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Add your plum chutney, hoisin sauce, cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar to the bowl with the reserved five-spice marinade

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and mix well – this is your plum mix

Once hot, add the plum mix and cook for 2-3 min or until reduced to a glossy sauce – this is your plum sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the five-spice roasted duck with the sesame roasted veg and cooked rice to the side

Drizzle the plum sauce over the duck

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
