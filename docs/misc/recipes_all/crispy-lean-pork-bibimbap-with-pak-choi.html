<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Combine your rice vinegar with 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a medium sized bowl

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons to the vinegar mixture and give it all a good old mix up and set aside - this is your quick-pickled carrot salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5 min until starting to brown and crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then trim and slice your spring onion[s] finely

Wash then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the white bases into bite-size pieces & shred the green tops</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pork has browned, add your soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, sliced spring onion, chopped ginger, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer everything to a bowl and set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan (no need to wash it!) to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the white pak choi (keep the shredded green tops for later) and the remaining garlic

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min, then add the green tops, cover and cook for 1-2 min further or until wilted

Transfer the cooked pak choi to a separate bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan (no need to wash it!) to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your black sesame seeds then crack your egg[s] into the pan, over the sesame seeds

Cook, covered for 2-3 min or until done to your liking – these are your sesame fried egg

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, add the cooked rice to a bowl then add the crispy lean pork, quick-pickled carrot salad and pak choi

Top with the sesame fried egg

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
