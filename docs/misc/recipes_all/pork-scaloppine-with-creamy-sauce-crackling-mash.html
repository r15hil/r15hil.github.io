<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 230ºC/ 210ºC (fan)/ gas 8, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Pat your pork loin steak[s] with kitchen paper and cut the rind off, then using a sharp knife, score the rind on a diagonal, being careful not to cut all the way through

Add the scored rind to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-22 min or until the pork rind is golden and crispy, then set aside until cooled – this is your crackling

Cover the steak[s] in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened to approx. 1cm in thickness

Combine 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and your dried sage on a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper, then drizzle the flattened steak with a little vegetable oil and press them into the seasoned flour until well coated – this is your coated pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once cooked, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork scaloppine[s]

Once cooked through, transfer the pork scaloppine[s] to a plate to rest and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s] and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a small knob of butter

Once melted, add the chopped shallot, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water, your chicken stock mix and your soft cheese

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for a final 2 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your creamy sauce

Transfer the pork scaloppine[s] to the pan and reduce the heat to very low until ready to serve – this is your pork scaloppine & creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Chop the crackling finely

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork scaloppine & creamy sauce with the mashed potatoes and peas to the side

Sprinkle the chopped crackling over the mashed potatoes – this is your crackling mash

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
