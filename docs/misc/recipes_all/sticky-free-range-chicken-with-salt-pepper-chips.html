<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into strips

Add the chicken strips to a bowl with your cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside (reserve the pan for later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small cubes

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any remaining oil

Add the chopped pepper, ginger and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your honey, red chilli relish and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

Once thickened, add the crispy chicken to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the chicken is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky free range chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky free range chicken with the salt & pepper chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
