<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the tomato wedges to a baking tray with your plum tomatoes, cherry tomatoes and garlic clove[s] (skin on)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place your rosemary stems on top of the tomatoes (don't strip the leaves off)

Drizzle over olive oil, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until starting to blister and char

Tip: Crowd the tomatoes together for the best blistering!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your toasted sesame seeds to a food processor with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and your basil

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt

Pulse until roughly blitzed

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with the olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes are done, remove the tray from the oven

Carefully remove the skin from the roasted garlic clove[s] (they will be hot!)

Add the roasted garlic to the food processor (not a fan of garlic? Just add a little!) and pulse again until combined – this is your sesame seed pesto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the rosemary stems and discard, then crush the roasted tomatoes with the back of a fork to release the juices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi is crispy, add the sesame seed pesto to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the pesto fully coats the gnocchi – this is your sesame seed pesto gnocchi

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sesame seed pesto gnocchi topped with the crushed roasted tomatoes and the salad to the side

Tip: Drizzle over all the juices and caramelised bits from the tray!

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
