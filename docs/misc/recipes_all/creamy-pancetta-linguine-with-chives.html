<p><strong>Description:</strong> This classic Italian linguine dish should be in everyone’s repertoire. Why? Because it takes no time to make. There’s much debate about whether or not to use cream in the egg-based sauce. We’ve met halfway and opted for a tiny portion of Cornish clotted cream. Best of both! Shhh...don’t tell the Italians! </p>

<p>Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Meanwhile, wash, dry and rip the red gem lettuce into rough, bite-size pieces</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Combine the white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your dressing&nbsp;</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Once the pancetta is crispy, reduce the heat to low and add the chopped garlic&nbsp;</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Cook for a further 1 min, stirring constantly, then remove from the heat&nbsp;</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p><span class="text-highlight">Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Add the grated cheese, clotted cream, half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish) and season generously with both salt and pepper</span>


<span class="text-highlight">Whisk with a fork as if you were making scrambled eggs- this is your egg mixture</span>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine to the pancetta pan with a few splashes of the starchy cooking water and return the pan to a medium-high heat


Cook for a further 2 min or until most of the water has evaporated, stirring often</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to very low, add the egg mixture and stir continuously for 30 sec-1 min or until the mixture has thickened ever so slightly, adding more cooking water if you need to loosen it a bit - this is your carbonara


Tip: make sure your heat is very low, otherwise you will make scrambled eggs rather than a smooth sauce!


Dress the red gem with your dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the carbonara with the&nbsp;red gem salad to the side


Garnish the carbonara with&nbsp;the remaining chopped&nbsp;chives and a generous grind&nbsp;of black&nbsp;pepper


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
