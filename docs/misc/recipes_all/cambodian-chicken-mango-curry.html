<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop, then peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, add your basil, chopped shallot, ginger and half of your green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add in the chopped creamed coconut, add a squeeze of lime juice and blitz until finely chopped – this is your curry paste

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, add your curry paste to the pan with your ground turmeric and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chicken stock to the pan and cook, covered, for 6-8 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone!

Chop the mango flesh into small bite-sized pieces, discarding the stone[s]

Slice the remaining green chilli finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the chopped mango through the chicken curry and serve over the basmati rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with your nigella seeds, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
