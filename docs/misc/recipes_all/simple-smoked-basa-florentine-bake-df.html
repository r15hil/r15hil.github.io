<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, reboil a kettle

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled water

Add the single soya, wholegrain mustard and a generous grind of pepper and stir it all together – this is your creamy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and crush them lightly with a fork

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the smoked basa mixture with the crushed potatoes, spread them out evenly

Put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until the potatoes are crispy and browned – this is your dairy-free smoked basa florentine bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the dairy-free smoked basa florentine bake to cool for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
