<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high and add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

Add half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and stir it all together – this is your coriander chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed tortillas with the shredded lettuce, spiced meat-free mince and tomato salad

Drizzle the coriander chutney all over and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and lemon wedge[s]
