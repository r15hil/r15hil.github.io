<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Roast the garlic 


Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7.


Cut a piece of tin foil (or baking paper) approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper. Add the garlic cloves (skins on) to the foil with a drizzle of olive oil.


Scrunch the edges of the foil together to form a sealed parcel and add the parcel to a baking tray.<br /><br />Put the tray in the oven for an initial 5 minutes.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Make the hazelnut crumb


Meanwhile, boil a kettle.


Zest 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon.


Bash the hazelnuts&nbsp;into fine crumbs with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose them!).


Chop the dill finely, including the stalks.


Combine the&nbsp;chopped dill, bashed hazelnuts, lemon zest&nbsp;in a bowl. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;&ndash; this is your hazelnut&nbsp;crumb.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cook the potatoes 


Peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces.


Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-15 minutes or until fork-tender.


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot.

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Encrust the salmon


Once the garlic has had 5 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and add the salmon fillets.


Spread the Dijon mustard over the salmon and top with the&nbsp;hazelnut crumb.


Return&nbsp;the tray to the oven for a further 10-12 minutes or until the crumb is&nbsp;golden and the salmon is cooked through &ndash; this is your hazelnut-crusted&nbsp;salmon.


Tip: your fish is cooked when it flakes easily.

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Once done, remove<span class="text-highlight"> the salmon</span> tray from the oven.

Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and cook for 1 minute or until the vegetables are fully coated in the lemon butter.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Cut the remaining lemon into wedges.
