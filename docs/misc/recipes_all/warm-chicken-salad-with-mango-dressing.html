<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the courgette slices, pepper strips, tomato wedges and onion wedges to a large tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] under the grill for 8-10 min or until softened and charred – these are your grilled vegetables</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, then pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them with a generous pinch of salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for an initial 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped

Once browned, reduce heat to medium-high then turn the chicken thighs and cook them for a further 8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
