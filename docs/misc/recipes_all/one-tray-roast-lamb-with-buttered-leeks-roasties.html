<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 230ºC/ 210ºC (fan)/ gas 8

Take your boneless lamb leg joint[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and chop into large chunky rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the carrot discs and leek rounds to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a generous splash of cold water, a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the foil around them to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray (or two)

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a large heat-proof bowl covered with cling film

Put the bowl in the microwave for 5-8 min or until slightly tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove the string from your boneless lamb leg joint[s], then pat dry with kitchen paper

Rub over your Dijon mustard, dried thyme, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coated lamb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped potatoes (reserve the bowl for later!) and coated lamb with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 25 min or until the lamb is cooked through and very slightly pink inside

Tip: Prefer no pink meat? Cook your lamb for 3-5 min longer!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the lamb has had 25 min, remove it from the oven, transfer to a clean chopping board and leave to rest for 3 min – this is your thyme roast lamb

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3 min or until the potatoes are roasted and golden and the veg is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is nearly ready, boil a kettle

Combine your gravy base with 125ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water in the reserved bowl, whisk thoroughly

Put it in the microwave and cook for 30-40 secs or until thickened and give everything a good mix up – this is your gravy

Slice the rested lamb finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced lamb with the roasties, buttered leeks and your mint sauce to the side

Drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
