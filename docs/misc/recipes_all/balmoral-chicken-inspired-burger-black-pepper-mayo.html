<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then drain and rinse the green lentils

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the drained green lentils to the pan with half the ground allspice (save the rest for another recipe!), Marmite, vegetable stock mix and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>boiled water and cook for 1 min

Add the panko breadcrumbs and mix it all together and cook for 1-2 min or until the stock has been completely absorbed – this is your veggie haggis mix

Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wrap each chicken breast portion in 3 rashers of smoked streaky bacon

Add the wrapped chicken to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray and put in the oven for 15 min or until the bacon has crisped, the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat inside!) and the juices run clear – this is your Balmoral chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine the cracked black pepper and mayo in a small bowl – this is your black pepper mayo

Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a plate and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Divide the veggie haggis mix into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape into equal-sized patties

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once the pan is hot, add the veggie haggis patties to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden – these are your veggie haggis burgers

Once cooked, slice the Balmoral chicken in half on a clean chopping board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread the black pepper mayo over each toasted bun base, then top with a handful of shredded lettuce, the veggie haggis burger and sliced Balmoral chicken

Top with a toasted lid and serve with the chips and remaining shredded lettuce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
