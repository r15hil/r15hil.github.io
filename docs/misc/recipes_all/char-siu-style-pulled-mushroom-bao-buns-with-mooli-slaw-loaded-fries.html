<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the dish with the meaty pulled mushrooms from the oven

Spoon the char siu-style sauce over the mushrooms and return them to the oven for 10-12 min further, basting them twice more until the sauce is thick and the mushrooms are nicely glazed – these are your char siu-style pulled mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pierce your bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the char siu-styled pulled mushrooms and top with some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo and garnish with half of the crispy onions and coriander leaves (save the rest for later!) – these are your char siu-style mushroom bao buns</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the char siu-style mushroom bao buns with the fries and remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw to the side

Load up the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo, crispy onions and coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
