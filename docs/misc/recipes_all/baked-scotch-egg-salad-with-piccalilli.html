<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and sprinkle over half of the black mustard seeds

Put the tray in the oven for 35 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add the eggs to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the eggs from cracking) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 6 min, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked eggs to the bowl to cool down quickly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a sheet of baking paper to your chopping board and sprinkle over a light dusting of flour

Remove 2 of the sausages from their skins and combine to form a giant meatball, then flatten the meatball into a circle (big enough to coat an egg) onto the floured baking paper

Repeat this with the remaining sausages until you have 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>sausage meat circles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel the cooled eggs

Add a peeled egg to the centre of each sausage meat circle

Wrap the sausage meat around each egg and seal it tightly on all sides so that there aren't any gaps – these are your sausage-coated eggs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bash the crispy onions with a rolling pin until finely crushed and add them to a plate

Add a drizzle of olive oil to a separate plate

Turn the sausage-coated eggs in the olive oil, shake off the excess, then add them to the crushed crispy onions and press firmly until they're evenly coated all over – these are your scotch eggs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the scotch eggs to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min, or until the sausage is cooked through

Meanwhile, add the cornichons to a food processor with the mustard ketchup, cider vinegar and remaining black mustard seeds

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and pulse until you're left with a chunky texture – this is your cheat's piccalilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Grate the radishes coarsely

Tip: Trim bottoms off and hold the stalks to grate them easily!

Wash the lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, cut the baked scotch eggs in half

Top the lettuce with the crispy potatoes, grated radish and scotch egg halves

Dollop over the cheat's piccalilli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
