<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes and chop them into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently

Once golden, transfer the golden breadcrumbs to a bowl until ready to serve and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the cooked potatoes to a low heat with half your double cream (save the rest for later!), 50ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> [100ml] </span>milk and a few knobs of butter

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth – this is your pomme purée

Tip: For extra smooth pomme purée add to a food processor and blitz until very smooth

Set the pomme purée aside (keep it in the pot!), ready to reheat later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash, then chop your cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Line a baking tray with a large piece of tin foil, then add the chopped cavolo nero to the middle of the foil with a few small knobs of butter and 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the kale to form a sealed parcel then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat and pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium- rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a clean plate to rest (reserve the pan)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

While the steak is resting, return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a few knobs<span class="text-danger"> </span>of butter and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Add the remaining double cream, your beef stock mix, cracked black pepper, Chinese rice wine and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[90ml] </span>boiled water

Cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your peppercorn sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pour any resting juices from the steak into the peppercorn sauce

Gently reheat your pomme purée, stirring frequently</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rump steak and peppercorn sauce with the shredded kale and pomme purée to the side

Sprinkle the golden breadcrumbs over the pomme purée and drizzle with your truffle oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
