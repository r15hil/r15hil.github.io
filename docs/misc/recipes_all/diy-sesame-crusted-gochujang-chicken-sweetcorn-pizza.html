<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your dried yeast to a bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your sweetcorn

Add your tomato paste and gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl and mix until fully combined – this is your gochujang sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with your yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut into balls (1 per person)

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Press each dough ball in the centre and gently push outwards, with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base[s] is slightly larger than a side plate – this is your pizza base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the pizza base[s] to a baking tray (or two)

Brush the crust with a little milk

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds on to the crust – this is your sesame crusted pizza base

Tip: Make sure the pizza bases don't overlap on the tray[s] to avoid raw dough!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top the sesame crusted pizza base[s] with your gochujang sauce, drained sweetcorn, grated cheese and the diced chicken thigh

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your sesame crusted gochujang chicken & sweetcorn pizza</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and your mayo to a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sesame crusted gochujang chicken & sweetcorn pizza

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Drizzle over the gochujang mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
