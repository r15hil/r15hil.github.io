<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

Season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your honey mustard marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and drizzle over the honey mustard marinade, then give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – there are your baked honey mustard chicken breast[s]</p><br><br>
