<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes, then add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are brown and crispy – these are your crispy paprika potatoes</p><br><br>

<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and slice into quarters

Add the lettuce quarters to a bowl with your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – these are your dressed lettuce quarters</p><br><br>
