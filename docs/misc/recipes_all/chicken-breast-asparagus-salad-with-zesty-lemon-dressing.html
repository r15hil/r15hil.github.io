<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 4-5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-8 min  or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, trim the woody ends off your asparagus and discard

Tip: Alternatively, bend the woody ends of the asparagus until they snap!

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After the chicken has had an initial 4-5 min, add the trimmed asparagus to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the asparagus is tender – this is your pan-fried chicken breast & asparagus</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut the lemon[s] in half

Combine your mayo and your wholegrain mustard in a large bowl with the juice of half your lemon[s], a generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt – this is your zesty dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the pan-fried chicken breast & asparagus to the bowl with the zesty dressing along with the cooked potatoes and tomato wedges

Give everything a gentle mix – this is your chicken breast & asparagus salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your chicken breast & asparagus salad over the salad and drizzle over any remaining dressing

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
