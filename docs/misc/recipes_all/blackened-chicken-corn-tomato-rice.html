Serve over corn, cherry tomato and coriander rice, with lime mayo for drizzling. Perfect for any O'Cajun! (Naturally gluten-free, but unsuitable for coeliacs).</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the&nbsp;basmati rice and stir to coat the grains


Add&nbsp;300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span>&nbsp;water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is tender &ndash; this is your corn rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the smoked&nbsp;paprika and ground&nbsp;allspice in a mixing bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;pepper and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span>&nbsp;salt


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast fillet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> thinner pieces


Add the sliced&nbsp;chicken to the spice mix and mix everything up until the chicken is fully coated&nbsp;

Note: the chicken will appear very dark and burnt &ndash; don't panic, this is how it's meant to be!</p><br><br>
