<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Peel and chop your shallot[s] in half

Chop your chestnut mushrooms in half

Chop your waxy potatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the dish is hot, add your chicken thighs and bacon lardons along with a grind of black pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour

Cook for 2 min or until the chicken is very lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, add your Chinese rice wine to the dish with your dried oregano, dried bay leaf[ves], tomato paste, beef stock mix and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water

Add the crushed garlic, chopped shallot, chopped mushrooms and chopped waxy potatoes

Give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for an initial 40 min

Trim your green beans

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the stew has had 40 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the trimmed green beans

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the green beans are tender – this is your one-pot chicken & bacon stew with green beans

Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until it's hot and crusty</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot chicken & bacon stew with green beans, season with a grind of black pepper and discard the bay leaf[ves]

Spread the toasted ciabatta with a knob of butter and serve to the side
