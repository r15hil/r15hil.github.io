<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and carrot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, carrot and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onions have softened, add your ground cumin, tomato paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and lamb mince and cook for 4-5 min further, breaking the lamb up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the lamb mince is cooking, add your ground turmeric to the drained potatoes with a splash of milk and a knob of butter

Mash until smooth then season generously with salt – this is your turmeric mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the chicken stock and garam masala to the pan and cook for 6-7 min further, or until the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency and the lamb has cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indian-style lamb filling

Wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Spoon the Indian-style lamb filling into an oven-proof dish (reserve the pan for later!)

Top evenly with the turmeric mash, add a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle over your nigella seeds

Tip: Gently run a fork over the mash to create a crispy top!

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – this is your Indian-style shepherd's pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the Indian-style shepherd's pie is almost done, wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your black mustard seeds and once you begin to hear them sizzle, add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until wilted

Once wilted, cover and set aside until serving – these are your mustardy greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the Indian-style shepherd's pie to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!), then serve with the mustardy greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
