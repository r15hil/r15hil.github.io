<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your capers and cook for 5-6 min, stirring frequently, or until crisp

Once crisp, transfer them to a plate, reserving the pan and any remaining oil – these are your crispy capers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Add the torn smoked mackerel, halved olives and the drained linguine to the pan

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked mackerel puttanesca topped with the crispy capers and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
