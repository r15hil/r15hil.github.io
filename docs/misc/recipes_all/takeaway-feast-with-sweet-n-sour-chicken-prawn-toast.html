<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Trim, then chop the spring onions finely and peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), drain the pineapple and then chop both into bite-sized pieces, reserving the pineapple juice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the reserved pineapple juice, half the soy sauce and half the sesame oil (you'll use the rest of both later!) in a small bowl with the tomato ketchup, rice vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar  – this is your sweet 'n' sour sauce

Add the long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with the remaining sesame oil, the remaining soy sauce and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sesame rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut the chicken breast portions into large, bite-sized pieces, then add to a bowl with 2/3 of the cornflour (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) then set aside for later – this is your crispy chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain the king prawns and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Using a separate chopping board, chop the drained prawns until they are very finely minced (keep chopping until they become sticky!)

Combine the minced prawns with the chopped garlic and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Trim the curved tops off the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> so that you are left with a flat surface (Don’t chuck the trimmings away. Instead, turn them into breadcrumbs!)

Slice the trimmed ciabatta in half through the middle, then into 4<span class="text-danger"> [8] </span>triangles

Spread the minced prawns onto the ciabatta triangles and press half the toasted sesame seeds (save the rest for garnish!) onto the minced prawns – these are your prawn ciabattas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the prawn ciabattas and fry for 4-5 min on each side or until the prawns are cooked through and the toast is golden – these are your prawn toasts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the pan with the crispy chicken to a medium-high heat

Add the chopped pepper, chopped pineapple and the remaining cornflour to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper has softened

Once softened, add the sweet 'n' sour sauce to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your sweet 'n' sour chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet 'n' sour chicken in a dish and garnish with half the chopped spring onion

Serve the sesame rice in a separate dish and garnish with the remaining chopped spring onion and sprinkle over the remaining toasted sesame seeds

Serve the prawn toasts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
