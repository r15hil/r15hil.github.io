<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray (or two!), reserve the pot for later

Gently crush the potatoes with a fork, season them with a generous pinch of salt and sprinkle over the chopped garlic and spring onion

Drizzle the potatoes with olive oil and give everything a good mix-up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until the potatoes are starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then return to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Once hot, add the haddock bites with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min, turning once half way, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it's opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, melt 40g <span class="text-purple">[60g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80g]</span> butter in a pot over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your mayo, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and chopped dill

Whisk until you have a thick sauce then season with salt and pepper – this is your speedy herby hollandaise</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the haddock with the crushed potatoes and wilted spinach to the side

Spoon the speedy herby hollandaise over the haddock

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
