<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans roughly (chop them in one bunch for speed!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Combine the chopped creamed coconut with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your curry powder, ground turmeric and ginger paste and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock to the pan with the chopped green beans, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Sit your haddock bites over the sauce and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until cooked through (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once done, gently stir everything together (add a splash more water if your curry is looking a little thick!) â€“ this is your coconut haddock curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconut haddock curry with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with your nigella seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
