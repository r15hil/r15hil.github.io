<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small pieces

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and a pinch of sugar in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped potatoes with the tomato stock and cook, covered, for an initial 6-7 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice finely

Peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 6-7 min, add your ground smoked paprika to the pan with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the diced pepper and onion, half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and your diced chorizo and cook for 7-8 min further or until starting to crisp – this is your smoky chorizo hash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your soured cream and remaining grated garlic (don't like raw garlic? Just add a little!) in a bowl and mix well – this is your garlic soured cream</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your cider vinegar to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the bowl and gently mix together – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg[s] a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fried egg over the top of the smoky chorizo hash with the dressed salad to the side

Dollop over some garlic soured cream

Garnish with chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
