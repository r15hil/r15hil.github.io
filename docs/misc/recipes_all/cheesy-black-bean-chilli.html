<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the drained beans, chopped tomatoes, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), vegetable stock mix, 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and the juice of half your lime[s]

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate

Put the plate in the microwave for 20 secs or until the tortillas are warmed through

Grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, mash some of the beans lightly with a masher (or fork!) and give everything a good mix up until combined and thickened â€“ this is your bean chilli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Garnish the bean chilli with the chopped coriander, grated cheese, chopped spring onion and a lime wedge

Dollop over your natural yoghurt and serve the warmed tortillas to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
