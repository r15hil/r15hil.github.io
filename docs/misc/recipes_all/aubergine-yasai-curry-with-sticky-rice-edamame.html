<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6


Peel and chop the sweet potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces


Top and tail the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then slice into half moons


Add both to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put into the oven for 18-20 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully


Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min


After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice


Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get perfectly fluffy rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once the pan is hot, add the sliced onion and grated apple with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened


Meanwhile, add the cornflour and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water to a small bowl and stir it all together</p><br><br>

Add the tamari and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> boiled water with the cornflour mixture to the pan


Cook for a further 3-4 min, whisking continuously, until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely</p><br><br>
