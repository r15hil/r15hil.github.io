<p><strong>Description:</strong> Our pork neck steaks are dry-rubbed in an aromatic spice blend of sweet aniseedy fennel seeds and chilli. The Italian style butter beans are cooked in a punchy tomato sauce, which mimics a slow cooked bean stew. Roasted potatoes complete the dish. Just like our fictional Italian mama would have made.</p>
