<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, squeeze your sausage meat from the skins into the pan (clean hands is the best way!) and discard the skins

Break the sausage meat up with a wooden spoon and cook for 6-7 min or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy sausage meat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add the shredded kale to the pan with a small splash of water and stir everything together until wilted

Add a knob of butter, a generous grind of black pepper and half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato risotto topped with the crispy sausage meat

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, drizzle with some olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
