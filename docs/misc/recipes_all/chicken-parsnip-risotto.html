<p><strong>Description:</strong> In this dish the chicken is marinated in balsamic vinegar which transforms into a glossy, tangy, sticky glaze when it cooks, cutting through the sweet, piny, cheesy risotto beautifully: a flavourful, unique contrast.</p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Continue to add the stock a quarter at a time, stirring continuously for 15-20 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is tender


Tip: Stirring releases the starch from the rice and makes it creamy


Return the chicken to the pot and cook for 3-4 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<p>Grate in half the cheese, add another knob of butter (optional) and stir through


Taste and tweak for seasoning, adding more if necessary
