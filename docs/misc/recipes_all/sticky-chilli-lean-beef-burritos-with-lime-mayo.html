<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mince is cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your lime[s] in half

Combine the juice of half your lime with your natural yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your honey and cook for 2-3 min or until the beef becomes crispy, sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sticky lean beef mince chilli</p><br><br>
