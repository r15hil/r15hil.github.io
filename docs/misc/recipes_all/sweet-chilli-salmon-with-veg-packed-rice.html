<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the salmon skin is starting to crisp, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Add the sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 6-7 min turning once halfway, or until the salmon is cooked through and the sauce has thickened

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
