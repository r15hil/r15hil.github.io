Add your basa fillet[s] and give everything a good mix up until the basa is fully coated in the marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Squeeze half the lemon wedges over the potatoes and add the squeezed wedges to the tray (save the remaining wedges for garnish)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once everything's been cooking for 20 min, remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle the spinach all over, then place your marinated basa fillet[s] on top

Return the tray to the oven for 12-15 min or until the spinach has wilted and the basa is cooked through – this is your Indian-style spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your red chilli[es] finely

Once everything's cooked, remove the Indian-style spiced basa from the tray and stir the wilted spinach through the potatoes and onion wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indian-style spiced basa with the potato, spinach and onion wedges to the side

Dollop with the remaining natural yoghurt

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), nigella seeds and remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
