<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat your grill to a high heat

Add your basmati rice, nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your nigella rice</p><br><br>

Add the paneer cubes and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your coated paneer</p><br><br>
