Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 min further or until thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef bolognese sauce

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the beef bolognese sauce to an oven-proof dish (or use individual ones for fancy presentation) and top with layers of the cooked potatoes

Pour the garlic cream all over

Sprinkle over the grated cheese with a pinch of black pepper and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your beef bolognese x dauphinoise potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and your red wine vinegar – this is your dressed salad

Serve the beef bolognese x dauphinoise potatoes with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
