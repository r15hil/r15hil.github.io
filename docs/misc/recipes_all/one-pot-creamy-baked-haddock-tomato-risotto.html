<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and a pinch of salt in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[780ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your cherry tomatoes and tomato paste to the dish with your roasted garlic paste, most of your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock to the dish along with your arborio rice

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven

Cook for 20-25 min or until the rice is almost cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your lemon[s] into 2 wedges per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once the rice is almost cooked, add your spinach, soft cheese and the juice of half your lemon wedges to the dish, then give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top with your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!), remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), and a pinch of salt and pepper

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the haddock is cooked through – this is your one-pot creamy baked haddock & tomato risotto

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot creamy baked haddock & tomato risotto with the remaining lemon wedges to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper
