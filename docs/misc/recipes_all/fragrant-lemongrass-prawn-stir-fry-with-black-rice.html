<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add the black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 30 min or until it's tender (it will still have a slight bite to it when cooked)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin

Remove the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>of the lemongrass and add to the pot with the black rice

Once the rice is cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the softer inner lemongrass core finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop the ginger

Peel and finely chop the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and blanched edamame beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until almost cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, half of the chopped lemongrass and half of the ginger (you'll use the rest for your dressing!)

Drain the king prawns, then add them to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until everything is cooked through – this is your lemongrass prawn stir-fry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely into rounds

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the remaining chopped ginger and lemongrass to a pestle & mortar and bash to a paste

Add the soy sauce, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice of the lime<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(not a fan of citrus? Use half!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemongrass dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemongrass prawn stir-fry with the black rice (discard the lemongrass outer layers!) and carrot ribbons to the side

Drizzle the lemongrass dressing all over and garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
