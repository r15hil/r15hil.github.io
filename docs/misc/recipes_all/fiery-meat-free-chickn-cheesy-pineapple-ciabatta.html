<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>After the chips have had 20 min, remove your pineapple from the can (save the juice for later!) and add to a separate baking tray

Top the pineapple slices with your grated cheddar cheese

Add your ciabatta[s] to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until the cheese is melted

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>reserved pineapple juice and season with a pinch of pepper – this is your pineapple mayo

Tip: Keep the remaining pineapple juice for your smoothies, cakes or marinades!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the meat-free chick'n to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks (this technique is known as ‘pulling’) then return to the pan – this is your shredded fiery meat-free chick'n

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble the ciabatta with a lettuce leaf, a cheesy pineapple slice, the shredded fiery meat-free chick'n, another lettuce leaf, another cheesy pineapple slice and finally a dollop of pineapple mayo

Serve with the chips and lettuce wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
