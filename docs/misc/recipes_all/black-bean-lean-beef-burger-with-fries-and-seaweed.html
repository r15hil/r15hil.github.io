<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut in half

Add the fries and pepper halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the fries are in the oven, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Combine your black bean paste and cornflour with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] <span class="text-danger">[</span>350ml] </span>boiled water in a bowl – this is your black bean stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your lean beef mince and your five-spice mix in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person and refrigerate until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the sliced onion to a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once the onion has started to soften, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the black bean stock and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has begun to thicken to a gravy-like consistency – this is your black bean & onion gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the gravy is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche buns in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan

Tip: Cooking for 3? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the lean beef patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min 

 Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!  

Flip each patty and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your shredded kale and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the shredded kale with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a bowl – this is your 'seaweed'

After the fries have had an initial 20 min, remove the baking tray[s] from the oven and top the fries with the 'seaweed'

Return the baking tray[s] to the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the 'seaweed' is crisp and the fries are golden</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top each toasted brioche base with a roasted pepper half, a handful of crispy 'seaweed', a lean beef patty, the black bean & onion sauce and finally a toasted brioche lid

Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the fries and serve to the side with the remaining crispy 'seaweed'

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
