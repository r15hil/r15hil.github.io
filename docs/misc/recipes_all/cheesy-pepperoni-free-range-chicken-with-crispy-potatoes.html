<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had 12 min, remove the dish from the oven and top with the grated cheese and chopped pepperoni

Return the dish to the oven and cook for a further 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted, the pepperoni has crisped and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cheesy pepperoni free range chicken

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the cheesy pepperoni free range chicken from the dish and give the tomato sauce a good mix up

Serve the cheesy pepperoni free range chicken over the tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes and salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
