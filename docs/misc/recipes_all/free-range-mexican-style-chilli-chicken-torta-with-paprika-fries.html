<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your paprika fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining ground smoked paprika and ground coriander to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] to the bowl and turn several times until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, add a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan then cook, covered, for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice half your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds

Chop the remaining tomato finely

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside, then shred the inner core</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your cider vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give everything a good mix up until fully coated – this is your free range Mexican-style chilli chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Add the shredded lettuce and diced tomato to the dressing and mix it all together – this is your zesty salad

Cut the warmed ciabatta in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the ciabatta with the free range Mexican-style chilli chicken, a dollop of your mayo, the sliced tomato and a lettuce leaf – this is your free range Mexican-style chilli chicken torta

Serve the paprika fries and zesty salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
