<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under running cold water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> [400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min, then remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your white miso paste and half of your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), then mix together until you have a loose paste – this is your miso marinade

Cut your basa fillet[s] into quarters and add to the miso marinade

Give everything a good mix up until the fish is fully coated, then set aside for later – this is your miso basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the fish is marinating, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to a plate and coat the miso basa in the cornflour, pressing firmly to coat the fish evenly and set aside

Tip: Coat the basa in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Add the diced shallot to a small bowl with your mayo, ginger paste, half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for later!) and a splash of cold water to loosen the sauce

Season with a crack of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your ginger & coriander mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 4 min on each side until golden, crisp and cooked through – these are your Asian-style basa goujons

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the sliced spring onion to a bowl with the edamame beans, tamari soy sauce, remaining rice vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Add the remaining chopped coriander to the edamame beans and mix everything together – this is your edamame salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sushi rice with the edamame salad, Asian-style basa goujons and ginger & coriander mayo to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
