<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, add the eggs to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking!)

After 4 min add the green beans and boil for a further 3-4 min or until the beans are tender

Once done, drain and run everything under cold water</p><br><br>
