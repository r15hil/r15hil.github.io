<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 6-7 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Wash, then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Drain and rinse your sweetcorn</p><br><br>
