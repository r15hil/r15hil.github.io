<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the tofu is marinating, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once very hot, add the marinated tofu and cook for 6-7 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into matchsticks

Dissolve your pho broth paste, umami seasoning and vegetable stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[800ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water – this is your pho stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut your lime[s] in half

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Strip most of your mint leaves from their stems, leave some on the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the drained noodles to the pan with the pho stock and remaining tamari soy sauce and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are completely tender, then remove from the heat and add the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your fragrant pho

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant pho topped with the crispy tofu, chopped coriander, mint leaves and stems and the carrot matchsticks

Drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
