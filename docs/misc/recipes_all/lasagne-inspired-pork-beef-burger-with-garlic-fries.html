<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and peel and grate your garlic

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your garlic fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your pork & beef mince (remove the paper if required) to a bowl with your dried oregano, remaining grated garlic and half your beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person and add to a separate baking paper-lined baking tray</p><br><br>

Add 75ml<span class="text-purple"> [110ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> milk to the pot and cook over a medium heat for 3-5 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your cheesy sauce</p><br><br>

<p>Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the remaining beef stock mix and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>warm water

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the burger[s] is cooked, discard the excess juices on the tray

Top each patty with the tomato sauce, then the cheesy sauce

Return the tray to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until everything is bubbling – this is your lasagne-style pork & beef burger patty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fries are golden, remove from the oven and move to one side of the tray[s]

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray[s], cut-side up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top the warmed brioche base with a lasagne-style pork & beef burger patty (and any extra sauce from the baking tray[s]!), then top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your Lasagne-style pork & beef burger

Serve with the garlic fries and salad to the side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and your balsamic vinegar to the salad and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
