<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potato to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-5 min <span class="text-danger">[6-8 min]</span> or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, mash them until smooth

Break up the crab meat gently with a fork, then add it to the crushed potatoes with the ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your crab cake mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then slice finely

Add the chopped cucumber and baby leaf salad to a large bowl with the cider vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Bring a pot with plenty of boiled water to the boil over a high heat

Crack the eggs gently into the water and leave them for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your poached eggs</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crab potato cakes with the poached egg on top and the dressed salad to one side

Drizzle the sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) over the poached egg

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
