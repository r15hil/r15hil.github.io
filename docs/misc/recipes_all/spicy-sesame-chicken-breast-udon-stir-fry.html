<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and chopped pepper to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 6 min or until the chicken is starting to brown</p><br><br>

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the carrot has softened, add the spicy sesame sauce to the pan and cook for a final 2-4 min or until everything is warmed through, fully coated in the sauce and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy sesame chicken breast udon stir-fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy sesame chicken breast udon stir-fry and garnish with the sliced spring onion and top with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
