<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces (Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess!), then deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Chop half your cucumber and sweet pointed pepper into batons</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces

Add your soy sauce to a large bowl with your maple syrup, half your mayo and half your sesame seeds (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sesame marinade

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the sesame seeds or just add a little!</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer half your sesame marinade to a separate small bowl and set aside

Add the chopped chicken to the large bowl of sesame marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Thread the marinated chicken onto the soaked skewers – these are your chicken skewers

Add the chicken skewers to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and pull up the edges of the foil to form an open parcel (this will collect any juices!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 minutes, turning once halfway, until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your maple sesame chicken skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While your rice and chicken skewers are cooking, add your rice vinegar to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, remaining sesame seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your spicy dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the smashed cucumber and chopped pepper to the spicy dressing and mix it all together

Season with a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt – this is your spicy smashed cucumber salad

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the pepper and cucumber batons plain!</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the maple sesame chicken skewers over the cooked rice with the spicy smashed cucumber salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining sesame marinade all over the chicken and rice

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Serve the cucumber and pepper batons to the side with a dollop of the remaining mayo</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
