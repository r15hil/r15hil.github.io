<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Do this in batches!

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, return the drained potato & carrot to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk, your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your harissa mash

Tip: Don't worry if your carrot doesn't get completely smooth, it will add some texture to your mash!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked basa over the harissa mash

Drizzle over the creamy tomato sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
