<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped aubergine, courgette and pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with a very generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and black pepper

Sprinkle over your dried oregano, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While your veg is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and your arborio rice and cook for 30 secs

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until evaporated

Once evaporated, add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your tomato stock

Once the vegetables have had 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the halved cherry tomatoes and tomato stock

Mix it all together and return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5-8 min – this is your ratatouille</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese

Once the rice is cooked, add a knob of butter and half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and gently stir it all together – this is your cheesy risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the ratatouille over the cheesy risotto

Top with the chopped basil and remaining grated cheese

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
