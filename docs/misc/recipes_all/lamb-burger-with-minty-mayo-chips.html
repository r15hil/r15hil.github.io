<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) lengthways, into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle with vegetable oil and season generously with salt, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Pat your lamb mince dry with kitchen paper, then add it to a bowl with the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, a pinch of salt and a good grind of pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this will help the patty[ies] hold shape whilst cooking)

Shape the lamb mince mix into 1 equal-sized thin patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your cucumber, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of cucumber 'ribbons'

Squeeze out the excess liquid from the cucumber ribbons (over the sink is the easiest place)

Tip: You want to get rid of the excess liquid so that the cucumber absorbs the pickling vinegar</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your white wine vinegar to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and the cucumber ribbons

Mix to combine and set aside to pickle until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Combine your mayo and chopped mint in a small mixing bowl with a large drizzle of olive oil – this is your minty mayo

Slice your tomato[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)

Carefully cut the warmed ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, layer your ciabatta base with a pile of quick-pickled cucumber, a lamb patty, sliced tomato and a generous dollop of minty mayo, then top with the ciabatta lid – this is your lamb burger

Serve the lamb burger with the wedges and any remaining minty mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
