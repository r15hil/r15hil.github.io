<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the potato discs to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Crush 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife, leaving the skins on

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper, sliced onion and crushed garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened and caramelised

Once caramelised, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Zest 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomatoes to a bowl with the chopped coriander, half the white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lime and the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your chilli salsa

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Add the haddock bites to a large bowl with the cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the coated haddock bites and cook for 3 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through – these are your crispy haddock bites

Meanwhile, combine the mayo with the lime zest, chopped garlic and remaining white wine vinegar in a small bowl – this is your lime aioli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the golden potato discs topped with the caramelised pepper, onion and garlic (don't forget to remove the skins!) – this is your patatas a lo pobre

Add the crispy haddock bites with the chilli salsa and serve the lime aioli to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
