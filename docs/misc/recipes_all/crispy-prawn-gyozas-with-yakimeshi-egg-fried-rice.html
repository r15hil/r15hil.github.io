Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the cooked rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Remove from the heat, add your prawn gyozas and carefully add a splash of cold water, return to the heat and cook, covered, for 5 min, then remove the lid, and cook for a further 5-7 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Be careful when adding the water to the pan, it may splash!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the cooled rice and your vegetable stock mix and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined

Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your yakimeshi egg fried rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the remaining chopped garlic in a bowl – this is your chilli & garlic dipping sauce

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy prawn gyozas and yakimeshi egg fried rice with the chilli & garlic dipping sauce to the side

Garnish with the remaining shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
