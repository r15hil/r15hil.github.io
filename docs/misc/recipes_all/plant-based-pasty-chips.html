<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, grated carrot and diced potato to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until everything is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are softening, cut the remaining potato[es] (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

Put the pasty[ies] in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden and cooked through and the edges have puffed up – this is your plant-based pasty

Meanwhile, combine your mayo and remaining onion marmalade in a small bowl – this is your onion marmalade dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pasty is cooking, combine your cider vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressing and toss – this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based pasty with the chips, salad and onion marmalade dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
