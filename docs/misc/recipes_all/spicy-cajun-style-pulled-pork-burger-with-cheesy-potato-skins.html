<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish, draining away half of the juices

Sprinkle over your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, ground coriander, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and rub it into the pork, using the back of a spoon, then cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, pierce your red potato[es] with a fork, then add to a plate and cook in the microwave for 10-12 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your shredded red cabbage to a large bowl with half your soured cream (you'll use the rest later!), your cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and mix it all together – this is your cabbage slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potato[es] is cooked through, carefully slice the potato[es] in half (it will be very hot!) and scoop the potato flesh out into a bowl, leaving a little around the edges of the skin

Combine the potato flesh with half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!), your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining soured cream and mash it all together with a fork – this is your cheesy chipotle filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the potato skins to a baking tray and divide the cheesy chipotle filling between them, then top with the remaining cheese, sliced spring onion and drizzle with a little olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until golden brown – these are your cheesy potato skins</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 30 min, remove the pulled pork dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pull the BBQ pulled pork apart using two forks, then add your honey and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the sauce has reduced and the pork has started to crisp – this is your smoky Cajun-style pulled pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pork is in the oven, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top each toasted brioche base with the smoky Cajun-style pulled pork, a handful of cabbage slaw and a toasted brioche lid – this is your Cajun-style pulled pork burger

Serve the Cajun-style pulled pork burger with the cheesy potato skins and remaining cabbage slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
