<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the bulgur is cooking, sprinkle the dried oregano over a chopping board with a big pinch of salt

Press the chicken breast portions onto the seasoning so that they're evenly coated – this is your seasoned chicken</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, crumble the Greek cheese into small, bite-sized pieces

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the crumbled Greek cheese, sliced spring onion and rocket to a large bowl and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, reduce the heat to medium

Add a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Cut the nectarines in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and remove using a spoon, then roughly chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the balsamic vinegar with the fig relish, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your figgy dressing

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped nectarine and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the cooked chicken finely

Add the cooked bulgur and warmed nectarine to the bowl with the rocket, Greek cheese and spring onion and give everything a good mix – this is your nectarine & Greek cheese salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced cooked chicken over the nectarine & Greek cheese salad

Drizzle the figgy dressing all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
