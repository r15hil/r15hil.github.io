<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook your beef thoroughly, until piping hot and cooked through (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until the beef is beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the beef is browning, top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into thin discs

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger & garlic paste, tomato paste, soy sauce and 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp] </span>sugar in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your gochujang sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, add the carrot discs to the pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3 min or until slightly softened

While the carrot is softening, add your udon noodles to a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 2 min or until softened, then gently break apart using a fork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once softened, drain the noodles, then add them to the pan with the spinach and gochujang sauce

Gently stir it all together and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until the noodles are coated in sauce, the spinach has wilted and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your gochujang beef udon noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the gochujang beef udon noodles and garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
