<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted boiled water to the boil over a high heat


Add the linguine and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through but with a slight bite

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;stir the brown sauce and&nbsp;tomato paste into the reserved starchy pasta water with a large pinch of both&nbsp;salt and sugar


Stir to dissolve &ndash; this is your stock


Tip: pasta water is full of starch which helps your sauce stick to the linguine</p><br><br>
