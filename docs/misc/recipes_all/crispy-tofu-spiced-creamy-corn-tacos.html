<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white wine vinegar to a bowl with 1/4 of the diced shallot<span class="text-danger"> </span>and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir it all together and set aside — this is your quick-pickled shallot

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your sweetcorn (no need to drain), 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for an initial 5 min

After an initial 5 min remove the lid and cook, uncovered, for a further 3-4 min or until most of the liquid has absorbed, then remove from the heat – this is your spiced corn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut into strips

Add your soy sauce to a bowl with the tofu strips

Combine your cornflour with the remaining ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt on a plate

Press the marinated tofu strips into the spiced flour, turning a couple of times until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu strips and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp all over – this is your spiced tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the tofu is cooking, finely dice your tomato[es]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the diced tomato, chopped coriander and a pinch of salt to the bowl of quick-pickled shallot and mix to combine – this is your tomato salsa

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

Meanwhile, return the spiced corn to a medium heat to warm through, then stir through half your cultured coconut (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your creamy corn</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load up the warmed tortillas with the spiced tofu, creamy corn and shredded lettuce

Dollop over the tomato salsa and top with the remaining cultured coconut

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
