<h4>Step 1</h4>

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and a few generous grinds of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the potatoes are starting to brown

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, strip the mint leaves from their stems, then chop them roughly and discard the stems

Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Mix the chopped mint leaves (save a little for garnish!) through the refreshed peas then set aside for later – these are your minty peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the Dijon mustard and cider vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your Dijon mustard vinaigrette

Wash the lamb's lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken skin has crisped, turn the chicken thighs over and cook for 1 min further

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, remove them from the oven and transfer the crispy thighs to the other side of the baking tray[s] (skin side up)

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the chicken is crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are roasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Once the chicken and potatoes are done, transfer the crispy chicken to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing – this is your sliced crispy chicken

Mix the roast potatoes through any chicken juices left in the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> for extra flavour – these are your peppery roasties</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the lamb's lettuce to the plate with the peppery roasties dotted on top

Sprinkle over the minty peas and place the sliced crispy chicken over the top

Drizzle over the Dijon mustard vinaigrette and garnish with the grated Italian hard cheese, Italian hard cheese shavings and the reserved mint leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
