<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped peppers and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – these are your charred peppers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the rocket between the plates and top with the crispy potatoes, roasted onion & tomato wedges, paprika chickpeas and charred peppers – this is your Spanish-style chickpea & charred pepper salad

Drizzle the spicy aioli all over
