<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a very high heat

Once very hot, add the beef strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until browned on both sides

Tip: Try not to stir the beef too much as this will prevent it from browning!

Once done, transfer the beef strips to a plate to rest</p><br><br>
