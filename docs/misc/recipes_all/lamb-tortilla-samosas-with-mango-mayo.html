<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot and grated carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the shallot is starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add your lamb mince and cook for 5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the lamb is browned, add the chopped garlic, ground cumin, curry powder and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced lamb filling

Meanwhile, combine 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> flour with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> water in a bowl to form a thick paste – this is your flour paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a tortilla to a clean board and using your finger, rub some of the flour paste along the edge of one quarter of the tortilla

Fold the tortilla in half and press firmly to seal the bottom half, leaving an opening at the top

Tip: This will make filling your tortillas easier!

Repeat this with the remaining tortillas – these are your samosa shells</p><br><br>

Use the remaining flour paste to seal the top half of the samosa shells – these are your lamb tortilla samosas

Tip: Press firmly on the edges to make sure there are no gaps!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the lamb tortilla samosas to a baking tray (or two!) and brush them on both sides with a little olive oil until evenly coated

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the samosas are in the oven, add your cider vinegar to a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper and whisk with a fork – this is your dressing

Combine your mayo, mango chutney and most of your nigella seeds (save some for garnish!) in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the lamb samosas in half and serve with the shredded lettuce and mango mayo to the side

Drizzle the dressing over the lettuce leaves and garnish with the remaining nigella seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
