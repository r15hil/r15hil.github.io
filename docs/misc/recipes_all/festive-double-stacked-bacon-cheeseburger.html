<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skin on) into thin chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and your dried sage

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until they are starting to brown – these are your festive fries

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a pot over a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk in your beef stock into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chips and gravy are cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Add your beef mince to a bowl, season with salt and pepper and roll into 2 meatballs per person

Once the chips are starting to brown, push them to one side of the tray[s], add your smoked streaky bacon to the other and return to the oven for 12-15 min or until the chips are crispy and the bacon is golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs, press them down firmly with a spatula to form a thin burger shape and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly charred on the bottom

Flip the burgers and top half with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the cheese has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the burgers are cooking, cut the ends off your ciabatta[s] and slice in half

Tip: Don’t chuck the crusts away. Instead, turn them into croutons!

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the ciabatta and brioche halves to a separate tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once toasted, add the ciabatta to the gravy and set aside for 1-2 min or until it has started to soak up the gravy

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the brioche base and lid with your mayo and cranberry sauce

Top the brioche base with some shredded lettuce, the cheesy beef patty, gravy-soaked ciabatta, remaining beef patty, crispy bacon, more shredded lettuce and the brioche lid

Skewer the burger and serve the festive fries and any remaining gravy to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
