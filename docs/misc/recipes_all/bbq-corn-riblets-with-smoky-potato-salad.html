<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes in half lengthways then slice them into half moons

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with the smoked paprika, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender but not crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>WARNING: The next step is a little tricky and could be dangerous so please read carefully!

Stand the sweetcorn cobettes upright on the larger flat end

Using your weight, and with your fingers well clear, push down on the knife and slice the cobettes in half lengthways

Tip: Make sure your knife is sharp. When slicing, hold the knife firmly and keep both hands above the blade. If you’re worried about slipping, chop the corn into two shorter cobs before slicing in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>One by one, put the halved cobettes flat-side down

As with before, use your weight again with your fingers well clear and push down on your knife to chop them in half again, lengthways – these are your corn riblets

Tip: If any naturally break apart, don't worry. They'll taste just as good!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the corn riblets to a separate baking tray with the ground coriander, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until the riblets are nicely coated in the spices

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until lightly golden and starting to curl slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While everything's cooking, chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped tomatoes and coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Mix the chipotle paste with half the mayo (save the rest for later!) – this is your chipotle mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Once the potatoes are done, transfer them to a large bowl with the sliced shallot, the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lime and the remaining mayo

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a gentle mix – this is your smoky potato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the corn riblets with the smoky potato salad, tomato salsa and chipotle mayo to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge and enjoy!
