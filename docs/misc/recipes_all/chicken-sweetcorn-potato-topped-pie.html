<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sweetcorn (no need to drain) to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly caramelised then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 1-2 min

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>
