<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the veg is cooking, add a handful of flour to a plate with the remaining dried oregano and a pinch of salt – this is your herby flour

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add to the herby flour, turn several times until fully coated – this is your coated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake with a pinch of salt and cook for 6 min on each side or until cooked through

Once the croutons and roasted veg are cooked, add them to the dressing with the sliced cucumber

<h4>Step 8</h4>
