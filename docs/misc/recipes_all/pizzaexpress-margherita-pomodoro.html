<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the dough balls have rested for 15 min, press your palm into the middle of a dough ball to flatten it until it is twice as wide

Turn the dough over and repeat a few times, until approx. 24cm in diameter (use a rolling pin to help you!)

Repeat with the other dough ball<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>– these are your pizza bases

Transfer the pizza bases to a baking paper-lined baking tray</p><br><br>

Season with a pinch of salt
