<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leeks to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the gnocchi and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, add the wilted spinach to the pan and cook for 1-2 min

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into quarters

Combine the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon into the pan and add most of the chopped dill and basil (save some for garnish!)

Season with a crack of black pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Crumble the feta into the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until the cheese starts to melt into the mixture

Transfer the crispy gnocchi to the pan and stir everything together – this is your spanakopita-style gnocchi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spanakopita-style gnocchi with the rocket to the side

Drizzle over the lemon dressing and season with a crack of black pepper

Garnish with the reserved chopped herbs and lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
