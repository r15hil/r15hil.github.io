<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your turmeric fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Combine half your white wine vinegar and half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl – this is your quick-pickled onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, combine your lamb mince and half your curry powder (save the rest for later!) in a medium bowl with a generous pinch of salt

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands are the best way!), divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has slightly softened, add a generous knob of butter and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pot with the remaining curry powder and your ground smoked paprika

Add your tomato paste, the remaining white wine vinegar and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> boiled water, a generous pinch of salt and cook for a final 4-5 min or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your vindaloo-style chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chutney is thickening, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the lamb patty[ies] and cook for 5-6 min on each side, or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced lamb patty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the quick-pickled onion from the bowl and set aside, reserve the bowl with the pickling liquid

Add your mayo, the remaining ground turmeric and a drizzle of vegetable oil to the pickling liquid and give it a good mix up – this is your turmeric mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the turmeric fries are golden and crisp, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the spinach and your nigella seeds

Return the tray to the oven for a final 1-2 min or until the spinach is slightly softened

Once softened, mix everything together – these are your saag fries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread a toasted brioche base with the vindaloo-style chutney, then add a spiced lamb patty, a handful of quick-pickled onion, a drizzle of turmeric mayo and a toasted brioche lid – this is your spicy lamb vindaloo x burger

Serve the saag fries to the side, topped with the remaining quick-pickled onion and turmeric mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
