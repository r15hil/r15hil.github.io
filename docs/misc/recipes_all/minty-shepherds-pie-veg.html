<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and finely dice your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and carrot and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to soften

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water

Once the onion and carrot have started to soften, add your lamb mince and cook for 4-5 min further, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan and stir until fully combined

Stir in the beef stock and your mint sauce and cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your lamb mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the lamb mixture (reserve the pan for later!) to an oven-proof dish and evenly top with the mashed potato

Tip: Gently run a fork over the mash to create a crispy top!

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your minty shepherd's pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the shepherd's pie is cooking, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, then wash to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice finely

Cut your courgette[s] into batons

Wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek and courgette batons with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-10 min or until soft and caramelised</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, allow the minty shepherd's pie to cool slightly (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the minty shepherd's pie with the leek & courgette to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
