<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s] and chop into large chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped aubergine to the pot with your butternut squash cubes and red Thai curry paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Roll your lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the the juice of half the lime[s] with the chopped shallot, chopped creamed coconut and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water

Add your ginger & garlic paste to the pot with your vegetable stock mix, peanut butter, soy sauce, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the cashew nuts

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your sushi rice to an oven-proof dish with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and cover tightly with tin foil

Put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice

Once the curry is boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until the butternut squash is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges
