<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(no need to peel!)

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and finely shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the cucumber matchsticks, grated carrot and shredded lettuce to a large bowl with your rice vinegar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside to pickle – this is your zingy veg

Combine your mayo with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a separate bowl – this is your spicy mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice your flat white mushroom[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3 min on each side or until tender and caramelised

Tip: Try not to stir the mushrooms too much as this will stop them from caramelising</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until crusty and warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have caramelised, reduce the heat to medium and add your soy sauce and agave to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further, turning the mushrooms to coat them fully in the sauce – these are your sticky mushrooms

Carefully cut the warmed ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread each ciabatta with some spicy mayo, then top with the sticky mushrooms, a handful of zingy veg, the chopped coriander and some sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your mushroom bánh mì

Serve the mushroom bánh mì with the chips and remaining zingy veg to the side and garnish with any remaining chopped coriander and sliced chilli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
