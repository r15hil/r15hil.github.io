<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook for 7-8 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the orzo has had 10 min, remove the dish from the oven

Add the blanched peas, most of the chopped dill (save some for garnish!) and half the grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the orzo with the crispy chicken thighs (skin side up)

Return the dish to the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy baked orzo & peas

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy baked orzo & peas topped with the crispy chicken

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and chopped dill

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
