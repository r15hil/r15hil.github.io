<p><strong>Description:</strong> These eggs are cooked somewhere between soft and hard boiled, giving them a solid shape with a yielding middle. We've served them rolled in a hazelnut 'dukkah' - a traditional Egyptian spice blend seasoning made from toasted nuts and spices. </p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle and preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Rinse the&nbsp;freekeh in a sieve under cold water, then&nbsp;add it to a pot, with a lid, with 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span>&nbsp;boiled&nbsp;water over a high heat&nbsp;


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 20-25 min or until cooked through, but with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the hazelnuts to a small baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until they've slightly darkened


Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Combine half of the chopped&nbsp;garlic (reserve the rest for step 6) with the Greek-style&nbsp;yoghurt, a drizzle of olive oil and<span class="text-highlight"> a pinch of</span>&nbsp;salt and pepper


Mix well and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Carefully add the eggs to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt&nbsp;over a high heat


Once boiling, cook for 7 min for perfect mid-boiled eggs


Tip:&nbsp;the salt prevents the eggs from cracking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the toasted hazelnuts and cumin seeds to a food processor


Blitz into a sandy nutty rubble (alternatively use a pestle and mortar)&nbsp;


Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in the nigella seeds&nbsp;&ndash; this is your dukkah


Transfer it to a plate and set aside&nbsp;

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Fill a bowl of cold water with ice (Gousto's ice packs are perfect)


Once the eggs&nbsp;<span class="text-highlight">are ready</span>, drain and add them to the ice water (to stop them cooking further)


Tip: alternatively, run them under very cold water for 3 min, then set aside in a bowl of cold water


Reserve the egg pot and give it a rinse out</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the&nbsp;cherry tomatoes in half


Return the egg pot to a medium heat with 1-2 tsp olive oil (or a knob of butter for extra richness)


Once hot, add the tomatoes, the remaining chopped&nbsp;garlic, harissa paste and a pinch of salt and sugar


Cook for 5-7 min on until they've softened&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and return the cooked freekeh to its cooking pot


Chop the dill finely, including the stalks and stir most of it through the freekeh (save the rest for garnish), season generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Peel the eggs carefully


Roll the peeled eggs in the dukkah mix until fully coated&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa&nbsp;tomatoes, garlic&nbsp;yoghurt and eggs over the freekeh


Garnish with the remaining chopped&nbsp;dill and dukkah


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
