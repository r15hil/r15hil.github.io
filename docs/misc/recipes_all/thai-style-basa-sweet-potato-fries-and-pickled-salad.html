<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, add your ginger & garlic paste to a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce and half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and mix to combine – this is your Thai-style marinade

Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the basa fillet[s] to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Peel lengths off your cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the carrot and cucumber ribbons to a bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of sugar and salt, give everything a good mix up and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled ribbon salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to the bowl with the marinated basa fillet[s]

Give everything a good mix up until the basa fillet[s] are coated in the Thai-style batter – this is your coated basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp, golden and cooked through – this is your Thai-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the basa is cooking, combine your mayo with the remaining chopped coriander in a small bowl – this is your coriander mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style basa with the sweet potato fries, quick-pickled ribbon salad and coriander mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
