<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine half your jerk paste (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with half your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper – this is your jerk marinade

Add your free range chicken thighs and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, transfer the browned chicken to an oven-proof dish and pour over any excess marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 12-14 min or until cooked through and slightly charred (no pink meat!) – this is your roasted jerk chicken</p><br><br>

<p>Combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and your mayo in a bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Once the chicken is slightly charred and cooked through, add the roasted jerk chicken (and any chicken juices!) to the bowl with the jerk glaze

Give it a good mix up – this is your glazed jerk-spiced free range chicken thighs</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the glazed jerk-spiced free range chicken thighs with the slaw and sweet potato wedges to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
