<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min

Add your ground smoked paprika and ground cumin and cook for 30 secs further

Add the drained kidney beans with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [125ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil

Cook for 4-5 min or until the beans are beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim and finely slice your spring onion[s] and add to a large mixing bowl

Drain your sweetcorn and add it to the bowl

Grate your cheddar cheese into the bowl, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly – this is your cheesy sweetcorn mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the kidney beans are beginning to break down, season with a generous pinch of salt and squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s]

Remove the beans from the heat and mash into a semi-smooth paste – these are your refried beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide the refried beans and cheesy sweetcorn mixture between your tortillas, covering only half

Fold each tortilla over and press down firmly so you're left with 3 half moon-shaped sandwiches per person – these are your quesadillas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the quesadillas to a baking tray (or two!)

Place a second baking tray[s] on top to weigh them down slightly

Put the stacked trays in the oven for 10 min or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted – these are your refried bean & corn quesadillas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the juice of the remaining lime with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing

Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and mayo with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your chipotle mayo

Slice the refried bean & corn quesadillas in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and toss it in the salad dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the halved refried bean & corn quesadillas alongside the dressed salad and the chipotle mayo for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
