<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and a drizzle of vegetable oil

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 8-9 min or until softened and caramelised

Once softened, transfer your caramelised onion to a small bowl (reserve the pan!), with your red chilli relish and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your sweet onion chilli relish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, add your smoked streaky bacon to a separate baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden and crispy

Dice your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your shredded lettuce and diced tomato to a medium bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressed salad

Grate your lighter cheese

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have been cooking for 25 min, move them to one side of the tray[s] and add the brioche halves to the other side

Top the brioche base[s] with the grated cheese and put the tray[s] in the oven for a final 5 min or until the brioche halves are crusty and the cheese has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, add a dollop of sweet onion chilli relish to your cheesy brioche base and top with crispy bacon, a fried egg and a brioche lid – this is your gluten free cheesy bacon & egg sandwich

Serve with the crispy spiced potatoes and top with a dollop of remaining sweet onion chilli relish

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
