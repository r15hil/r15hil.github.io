<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and halve the potatoes, then add them to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Tip: You will need some softened butter later so take it out of the fridge now!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with baking paper and a drizzle of vegetable oil then add the turkey joint<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (leave the string on!)

Slide half the sage leaves (you'll use the rest later!) under the string of the turkey joint<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and top with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> knobs of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover the turkey with tin foil and put the tray in the oven for 35 min or until it's cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil to a separate baking tray and put the tray on the bottom shelf of the oven to heat up

Top, tail and chop the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half lengthways (no need to peel)

With the flat side down, make diagonal crosses along the parsnip halves without cutting all the way through

Finely chop the remaining sage leaves and discard the stems

Combine the chopped sage with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> knobs of butter and spread the mixture onto the parsnips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them in a colander and shake them until they're fluffy

Reserve the pot for later

Carefully remove the tray of hot oil from the oven and add the drained potatoes, buttered sage parsnips and pigs in blankets

Turn them until they're fully coated in the oil and season with a pinch of salt, then return the tray to the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then peel and slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat the reserved pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, then add the shredded red cabbage, grated apple, 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, white wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and half the sliced onion

Season with salt and pepper and cook, covered, for 25-30 min or until all of the water has evaporated – this is your braised red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes and parsnips have been in the oven for 15 min, trim the ends off the Brussels sprouts and add them to the tray, then give the potatoes a good mix up

Return the tray to the oven for a further 10 min or until the potatoes are crispy, the parsnips are golden and the pigs in blankets are cooked through

Tip: Keep an eye on your parsnips and remove them early if they look ready so that the edges don't burn!

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the turkey is cooked through, remove it from the oven and set it aside to rest, then heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced onion and a knob of butter and cook for 3-4 min or until softened, then stir in 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Add 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water with the Henderson's Relish, chicken stock mix, soy sauce and a generous grind of black pepper, and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the string from the rested turkey, then slice it finely

Serve the sliced turkey with the pigs in blankets, braised red cabbage, roast potatoes, buttered sage parsnips, and roasted sprouts to the side

Add a dollop of cranberry sauce to the side and drizzle over the onion gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
