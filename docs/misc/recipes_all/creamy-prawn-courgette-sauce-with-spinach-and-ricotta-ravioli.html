<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Top, tail and peel lengths off your courgette[s] until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Stack the courgette ribbons and slice finely, lengthways into thin strips – this is your courgetti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the courgetti with a small pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the courgette has begun to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook your ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the ravioli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and slice (don’t chop!) your garlic

Drain your jumbo prawns

Once the courgette has softened, increase the heat to high and add the jumbo prawns and sliced garlic to the pan with a good grind of black pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the prawns are cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your crème fraîche and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add a splash of the starchy pasta water, mix it all together and cook for 1 min or until warmed through

Tip: Make sure the pan isn't too hot as this could cause your sauce to split!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce is warmed through, remove the pan from the heat and add the drained ravioli

Gently stir it all together until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy jumbo prawn, courgette and spinach & ricotta ravioli

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy jumbo prawn, courgette and spinach & ricotta ravioli

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
