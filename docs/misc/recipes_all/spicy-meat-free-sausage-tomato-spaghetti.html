<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the meat-free sausage pieces with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the meat-free sausage meat is cooking, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it until wilted

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool enough to handle, then squeeze out any excess water (clean hands is best!)</p><br><br>
