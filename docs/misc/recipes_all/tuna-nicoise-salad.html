<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, half your dried oregano (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your herby roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the egg[s] from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled egg[s], then fill a bowl of ice-cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl, set aside and reserve the pot with the water

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut in half</p><br><br>
