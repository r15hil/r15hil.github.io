<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Drain your sweetcorn

Once hot, add your baby plum tomatoes and drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes are starting to soften</p><br><br>
