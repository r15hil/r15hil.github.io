<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the Brussels sprouts into quarters

Add 70ml <span class="text-danger">[120ml]</span> milk and the white wine vinegar to a bowl – this is your cheat's buttermilk

Add the chopped sprouts to the cheat's buttermilk, give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate

Tip: Don't worry if the mixture is a little lumpy, it's meant to be!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the dried cranberries roughly

Remove 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> leaves from the gem lettuce, give them a wash and set aside, then cut the inner core into wedges

Cut the brioche buns in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Combine 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>cornflour (reserve the rest for later!) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water in a small bowl – this is your cornflour mixture

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 180ml <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water and stir in half the soy sauce – this is your gravy stock

Add the gravy stock to a large, wide-based pot over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the stock is hot, add the cornflour mixture and diced cranberries and whisk immediately to avoid any lumps

Add the meat-free chicken and cook for 1-2 min or until the stock has thickened to a gravy-like consistency and the meat-free chicken is warmed through – this is your gravy-soaked meat-free chicken

Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain the marinated sprouts from the cheat's buttermilk in a colander over the sink

Return the marinated sprouts to the bowl with the remaining soy sauce, dried sage and remaining cornflour and give it a good mix up to coat the sprouts thoroughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the coated sprouts and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp then transfer to kitchen paper – these are your sage-fried sprouts

Meanwhile, put the brioche buns in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Spoon out 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> of the gravy from the pot and mix it with the mayo – this is your gravy mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each warmed brioche bun with 2 lettuce leaves, the sage-fried sprouts, a drizzle of honey (don’t have a sweet tooth? Go easy!) and a spoonful of gravy-soaked meat-free chicken – this is your crowd sauced veggie Christmas sarnie

Skewer the crowd sauced veggie Christmas sarnie with a reserved sage-fried sprout

Serve with the chips, lettuce wedges, gravy mayo and any remaining gravy to the side  Enjoy!</p><br><br>
