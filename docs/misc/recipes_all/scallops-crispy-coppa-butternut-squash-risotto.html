<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Soften the onion


Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 350°F/ Gas 4.


Peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>. Peel and finely chop the garlic.


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat.


Once hot, add the diced onion and garlic and cook for 8-10 minutes or until softened.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Mash the butternut squash


Meanwhile, boil a kettle.


Add the butternut squash cubes<span class="text-highlight"> to a pot of boiled water (</span>just enough to cover them) with a pinch of <span class="text-highlight">salt</span>, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 minutes or until they're tender.

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cook the risotto


Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 700ml<span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> of boiled water.


Once the onion has softened, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat the grains in the oil.


Add <span class="text-highlight">1/3 </span>of the stock and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until it has absorbed.


Continue to add the stock a little at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 minutes or until the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Make the crispy sage


Once the risotto is almost done, heat a separate large, wide-based frying pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat.


Once hot, add the sage leaves and cook for 1 minute or until crispy.


Set aside on a piece of kitchen paper to drain the excess oil and season with a pinch of salt.


Reserve the pan for later.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Fry the king scallops


Pat the king scallops dry with kitchen towel.


Return the pan to a medium-high heat. Once very hot, add the scallops and cook for 1-2 minutes on one side, or until golden brown. 


Flip the scallops and cook for 1 minute further or until cooked through. 


Tip: your scallops are cooked when they turn opaque.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Finish off the risotto


Stir the butternut squash purée, grated Italian hard cheese and a knob of butter through the cooked risotto and cook for 1-2 minutes further or until the cheese has melted – this is your butternut squash risotto.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Break the coppa into shards.


Serve the scallops, coppa shards and crispy sage leaves over the butternut squash risotto.


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
