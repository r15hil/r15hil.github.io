<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Peel and roughly slice your shallot[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once slightly softened, add your roasted garlic paste, ground smoked paprika and ground cumin and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans and your sweetcorn

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and sweetcorn to the pan with your chopped tomatoes, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), vegetable stock mix and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>boiled<span class="text-danger"> </span>water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has begun to thicken – this is your Mexican-style tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked rice to the Mexican-style tomato sauce with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Top with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 2 min or until the cheese has started to melt – this is your cheesy Mexican-style rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy Mexican-style rice

Dollop over your soured cream and sprinkle over the chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
