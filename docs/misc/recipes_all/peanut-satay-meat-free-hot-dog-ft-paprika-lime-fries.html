<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, add the meat-free hot dog sausages to one side of a separate baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest your lime (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the zested lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your peanut butter and soy sauce in a small bowl with your chilli relish, half of the chopped peanuts and the juice of 1 lime wedge[s] per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>– this is your satay sauce</p><br><br>

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your lime-pickled mooli slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun

Once the meat-free sausages have had 15 min, remove the sausage tray from the oven

Add the cut hot dog buns to the other side of the tray, then return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the hot dog buns are warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your ground paprika and the lime zest to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the fries are golden and crisp add them to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – these are your paprika lime fries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each hot dog bun with a meat-free hot dog, then top with some satay sauce, remaining chopped peanuts, coriander leaves and some of the lime-pickled mooli slaw – these are your meat-free peanut satay hot dogs

Serve the paprika lime fries, the remaining lime-pickled mooli slaw and any remaining satay sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
