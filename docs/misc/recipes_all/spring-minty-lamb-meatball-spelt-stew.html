<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your lamb mince to a large bowl with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lamb mixture

Divide the lamb mixture<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape into 3 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped leek with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the leek is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix and soy sauce in 650ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.3L] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock

Once the leek is soft, add the remaining chopped garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chicken stock, spelt and bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 13 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 13 min, add the sliced carrot and browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the spelt is tender and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spring lamb meatball & spelt stew

Meanwhile, add your mint sauce to a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a small splash of cold water – this is your minty drizzle

Discard the bay leaf[ves]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spring lamb meatball & spelt stew in a bowl

Drizzle over the minty drizzle

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
