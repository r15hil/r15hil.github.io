<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place your hand on the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> on a chopping board

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a couple of handfuls of flour to a plate


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat them with a fork 


Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 5-6 tbsp vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once very hot, add the panko crusted chicken and cook for 2-3 min each side or until golden 


Transfer the golden chicken to a baking tray (keep the pan for the next step) and put it in the oven for 6-10 min or until cooked through <span class="text-highlight">(no pink meat!)</span></p><br><br>
