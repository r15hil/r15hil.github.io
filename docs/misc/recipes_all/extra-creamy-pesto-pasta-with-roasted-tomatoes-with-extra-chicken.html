<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large dry pan over a medium heat, then once hot, add your pine kernel & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once done, transfer the toasted seeds to a food processor</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portion to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

While the pine nuts & seeds are toasting, chop your tomato[es] into wedges and add to another baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until softened – these are your roasted tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, drain the farfalle & green beans, then return them to the pot with the creamy pesto

Give everything a good mix up until fully coated – this is your extra creamy pesto pasta

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the extra creamy pesto pasta with the cooked chicken

Top with the roasted tomatoes, season with a grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!
