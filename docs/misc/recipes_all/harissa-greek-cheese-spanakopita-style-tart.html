<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water over it so that it starts to wilt, then rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until cool, squeeze as much water out as you can and chop roughly

Combine the chopped spinach and Greek cheese in a bowl with your harissa paste, half your oregano and half your honey (save the rest for later!) – this is your cheese filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out as thinly as you can into a large rectangle with a rolling pin

Cut it, lengthways, into 1 rectangle per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Place the rectangles end to end and press together firmly so you end up with long piece[s]

Tip: Dab a little cold water on the edge to help them stick together!

Spoon the cheese filling into the centre of the pastry in an even line, then brush the long edge of the pastry with a little bit of cold water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, then use a fork to crimp along the edge

Roll the sealed pastry, starting at one end, into a spiral</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the pastry spiral to the lined baking tray 

Tip: Leave a 2 cm gap within the spiral so that it can puff up!

Brush the pastry spiral with milk and sprinkle over your nigella seeds and half your toasted sesame seeds (save the rest for garnish!)

Put the tray in the oven for 20-22 min or until golden and crisp – this is your harissa & cheese spanakopita-style tart</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Chop your tomatoes roughly

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl with the remaining honey and dried oregano, then add the chopped tomato, cucumber and the salad and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, sprinkle your ground sumac and remaining toasted sesame seeds over the roast potatoes and mix everything together – these are your sumac & sesame roast potatoes

Serve the harissa & cheese spanakopita-style tart with the sumac & sesame roast potatoes and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
