<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic clove[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Remove the skin and discard, then chop the garlic roughly

Add the chopped garlic, your arborio rice and saffron to the dish and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Stir in your vegetable stock mix and add 600ml <span class="text-purple">[780ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20 min or until most of the water has absorbed and the rice is almost cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Drain your king prawns

After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the drained king prawns, blanched peas and a small splash of water

Stir it all up, cover with the lid and return the dish to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese all over the risotto and top with the salad

Garnish with the lemon wedges, drizzle with some olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper
