<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse the long grain brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped ginger, mirin, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, tamari soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt in a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breast portions to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the butterflied chicken and cook for 4 min on each side until golden, then reduce the heat to medium

Add the zingy sauce and cook for a further 3-4 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is nearly tender, add the chopped garlic and mangetout to the same pot

Cook for a further 5 min before draining everything

Once drained, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir through the carrot ribbons until they've softened slightly – this is your vegetable rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean chopping board and slice – this is your zingy chicken

Serve the zingy chicken with the vegetable rice to the side

Pour over any remaining zingy sauce and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
