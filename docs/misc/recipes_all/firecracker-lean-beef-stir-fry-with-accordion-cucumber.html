<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up into bite-size pieces with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the mince is cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Once the mince has browned, add your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated

Add the carrot discs and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water

Add your ginger & garlic paste, Chinese rice wine, 2/3 soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and your red chilli relish with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your chilli stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the carrot has slightly softened, add the chilli stock with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 7-8 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened, the carrot is tender with a slight bite and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your firecracker lean beef stir fry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While everything's cooking, hold your cucumber in place between two chopsticks

Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) across the middle of the cucumber, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base

Tip: Don't have chopsticks, use two wooden spoons instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Turn the cucumber over and place it back between the chopsticks

Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) on the diagonal across the middle of the cucumber, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – this is your accordion cucumber

Add the accordion cucumber to a medium bowl with the remaining soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds – this is your sesame accordion cucumber</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the firecracker lean beef stir fry with the cooked rice and accordion cucumber to the side

Drizzle any remaining sesame sauce from the bowl over the cucumber

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
