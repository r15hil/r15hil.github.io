<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine the sliced spring onion, mayo, chopped capers, Dijon mustard, chopped dill and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar in a bowl – this is your remoulade

Separate and wash your lettuce leaves, pat them dry with kitchen paper, then set aside until later</p><br><br>

<p>Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and whisk

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a separate large bowl with a pinch of salt and mix it up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Coat your hake fillet[s] in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press it into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to coat everything evenly – this is your breaded hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Once hot, add the sliced ciabatta, cut-side-down and cook for 3 min or until lightly toasted

Once toasted, transfer the toasted ciabatta to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded hake and cook for 4-5 min on each side, or until golden and cooked through – this is your golden hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top a toasted ciabatta half with some lettuce leaves, a dollop of remoulade and the golden hake – this is your open Scandi-style hake sandwich

Serve the chips and any remaining remoulade to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
