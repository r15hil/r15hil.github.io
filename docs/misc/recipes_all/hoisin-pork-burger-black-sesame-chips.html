<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your pork mince (removed the paper if required), panko breadcrumbs and soy sauce to a bowl and give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Cut your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the brioche is toasted, wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium heat

Add your hoisin sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and cook for 1 min or until warmed through

Sprinkle your black sesame seeds over the chips – these are your black sesame chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top your toasted brioche base with a pork patty, a drizzle of warmed hoisin sauce, some cucumber salad, spring onion strips and the brioche lid

Serve any remaining cucumber salad and the black sesame chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
