<p><strong>Description:</strong> Wrapping chicken in bacon not only keeps the meat moist – it also acts as a seasoning. We love these pre-cooked lentils: they’re packed with protein and are simply stirred through with a splash of Shaoxing wine and a touch of cream at the last minute. Chicken-y, vegetable-y, lentil-y goodness. </p>
