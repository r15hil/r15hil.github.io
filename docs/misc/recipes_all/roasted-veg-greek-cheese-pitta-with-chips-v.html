<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate into wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into discs

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the onion petals, tomato wedges, sliced courgette and drained chickpeas to a separate baking tray (or two!) and sprinkle over your dried oregano and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the veg is lightly charred and softened – this is your roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are nearly ready, remove the tray[s] from the oven and push them to one side

Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the other side of the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and return to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the warmed pitta in half and fill with a dollop of garlic mayo, some of the roasted veg and crumbled Greek cheese – this is your roasted veg & Greek cheese pitta

Serve the roasted veg & Greek cheese pitta with the chips and remaining roasted veg and crumbled Greek cheese to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
