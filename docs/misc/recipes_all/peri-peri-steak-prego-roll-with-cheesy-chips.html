<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let the steak[s] adjust to room temperature, then chop your sweet pointed pepper[s] and peel and roughly chop your garlic

Add the chopped pepper, peeled garlic, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika and cider vinegar to a food processor

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt and blitz until smooth – this is your peri peri marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your rump steak[s] to a plate with most of the peri peri marinade (save the rest for later!)

Give it a good mix up so the steak[s] is evenly coated, then cover the plate with cling film and set aside to marinate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, slice your tomato[es] into rounds

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add the reserved peri peri marinade to a bowl along with your mayo and mix it all together – this is your peri peri mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat, and once very hot, add the marinated steak[s] with any remaining peri peri marinade from the plate

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each

Once the steak[s] is cooked, transfer to a clean plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are done, remove them from the oven and push into two piles

Top each pile with the grated cheese

Add your ciabatta[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min until the cheese has melted and the ciabatta[s] is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, transfer the peri peri steak[s] to a clean board and slice

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add a dollop of peri peri mayo to a ciabatta base and top with the sliced peri peri steak, tomato rounds, salad leaves and the ciabatta lid – this is your peri-peri steak prego roll

Serve the peri-peri steak prego roll with the cheesy chips and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
