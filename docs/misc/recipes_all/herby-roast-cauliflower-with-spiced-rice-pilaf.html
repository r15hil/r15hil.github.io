<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the cauliflower into florets and add them to a baking tray

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a lid with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Cook for 3 min or until the onion has softened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice to the pot and stir to coat the grains in oil

Add 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving - this is your spiced rice pilaf</p><br><br>

Fluff the spiced rice pilaf with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roast cauliflower over the spiced rice pilaf with the fresh chutney dotted around

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves
