<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the toasted ciabatta with the the remaining chopped basil and the roasted cherry tomatoes– this is your garlicky toast

Tip: Use a fork to squish the tomatoes onto the ciabatta to release their juices!

Serve the creamy ribollita stew with the garlicky toast on top
