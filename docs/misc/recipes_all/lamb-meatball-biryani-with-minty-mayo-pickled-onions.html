<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your lamb mince to a large bowl with half your mint sauce, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest the later!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, divide and roll into 3 meatballs per person (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until starting to brown all over

Once brown, transfer the meatballs to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chicken stock and basmati rice to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Add the browned meatballs, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the water has absorbed  – this is your biryani</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and roughly chop

Once the lamb is cooked through, add the chopped spinach to the biryani and give everything a good mix up – this is your lamb meatball biryani</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the lamb meatball biryani with the quick-pickled onion

Drizzle over the minty mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
