<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 80ml <span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>milk to a bowl with half the cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add the free range chicken thighs to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later

Tip: This will help to tenderise your chicken!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice the cucumber finely into discs

Add the cucumber discs and the remaining cider vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot with 10g <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add the sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together until fully combined and resembles a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice the brioche buns in half

Peel and grate the garlic

Add the mayo to a small bowl with the dried oregano, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Discard all the excess marinade from the chicken

Add the ground smoked paprika, cornflour and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>flour to the bowl with the marinated chicken

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 7-8 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread a little bit of the ranch-style dip on the base of the warmed brioche halves, top with a handful of the quick-pickled cucumber and the fried free range chicken, then drizzle the buffalo sauce over the top

Top with the warmed brioche bun lids and serve the fries with the remaining quick-pickled cucumber and ranch-style dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
