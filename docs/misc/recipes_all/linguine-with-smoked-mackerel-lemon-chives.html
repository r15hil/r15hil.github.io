Give everything a good mix up and season with a generous grind of pepper – this is your smoked mackerel linguine</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked mackerel linguine with the zingy salad to the side

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and reserved chopped dill and chives all over and then season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
