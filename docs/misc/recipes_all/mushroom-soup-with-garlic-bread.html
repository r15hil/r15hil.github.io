<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped potato and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then once fragrant, add your soy sauce and vegetable stock mix to the pan with 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Tear the remaining buttered ciabatta into bite-sized pieces and add to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-7 min or until golden and crusty – this is your garlic bread and croutons</p><br><br>

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
