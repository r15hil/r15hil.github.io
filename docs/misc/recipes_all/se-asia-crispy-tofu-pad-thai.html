<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper, then tear into bite-sized pieces and combine in a bowl with half your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!), your umami seasoning and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coated tofu

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan (reserve the bowl) and cook for 10-12 min or until golden – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Combine the remaining cornflour with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water in the reserved bowl and mix until well combined

Add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar with your soy sauce, tamarind paste, ketjap manis and the juice of half your lime[s] (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your pad Thai sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into thin strips

Once the tofu is crispy, transfer the crispy tofu to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper to the pan

Cook for a further 5-6 min or until the pepper is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Push the pepper to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the pepper</p><br><br>
