<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat

Transfer the browned chicken to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add a knob of butter with the chopped onion, half your smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until the onion has softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped potatoes, browned chicken, thyme (chuck it in, stalks and all!) and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min or until the Chinese rice wine has evaporated

Add the chicken stock and a generous pinch of salt, and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling reduce to medium and cook for an initial 10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your sweetcorn

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

After an initial 10 min, add the drained sweetcorn and spinach to the pan for a final 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, stir through your soft cheese with a good grind of black pepper – this is your creamy chicken breast & sweetcorn chowder

Discard the thyme stalks and shred any larger pieces of chicken apart, using two forks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken breast & sweetcorn chowder in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining smoked paprika

Season with a generous grind of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
