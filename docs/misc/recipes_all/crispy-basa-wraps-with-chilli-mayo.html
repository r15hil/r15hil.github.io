<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add a handful of flour to a plate along with your ground paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the grated cheese, lots of pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your basa fillet[s] into 3 strips per person

Coat the basa strips in the spice mix (make sure to tap off any excess!)

Add the coated basa strips to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded basa strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with tin foil

Add the breaded basa strips to the tray and top them with any remaining cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through and golden – these are your crispy basa strips

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Slice your tomatoes finely into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the basa strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy basa strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
