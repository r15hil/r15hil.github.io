<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then chop your hazelnuts roughly

Heat a large, dry pan over a medium heat and once hot, add the hazelnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once lightly golden, transfer them to a chopping board, reserving the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat

Add the beetroot purée to the pan with your grated Italian hard cheese, half the goats' cheese, the remaining cider vinegar and most of the chopped basil (you’ll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy beetroot risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the creamy beetroot risotto with the remaining crumbled goats' cheese, roasted beetroot, toasted hazelnuts and remaining chopped basil

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
