<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into wedges and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Add the juice from your lemon[s], your soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and mix to form a paste – this is your peri peri paste

Add the chicken pieces to the paste and mix until fully coated – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has caramelised, push to one side of the pan and increase the heat to high

Add the coated chicken to the other side of the pan and cook for 5 min on each side until golden, then cover with a lid and cook for a further 6-8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
