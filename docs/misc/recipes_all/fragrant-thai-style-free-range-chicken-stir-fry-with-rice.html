<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Add your basmati rice, bashed lemongrass and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and cover until serving</p><br><br>

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s], chop your red chilli[es] roughly and peel your garlic

Add the garlic and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a pestle & mortar and bash into small rough pieces

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!</p><br><br>
