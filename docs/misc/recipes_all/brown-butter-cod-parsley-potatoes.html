<p><strong>Description:</strong> The twist to this classic, clean dish is in the vinaigrette; made by soaking chopped shallots in vinegar, which mellows their flavour, then combining them with butter which is melted and browned into a naturally nutty tasting sauce. Served with greens and potatoes, tumbled together with fresh parsley and toasted hazelnuts. We're nuts for it...</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have been cooking for 15 min, add the green vegetable medley to the pot


Cook the potatoes and green vegetables together for a further 4 min, then drain everything and return to the pot, allowing them to steam dry for a few min


Once done, leave the toasted hazelnuts to cool slightly then chop them roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan over a high heat


Pat the cod fillets dry, rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with a little salt


Once hot, add the cod to the pan and cook for 4 min, carefully flipping once halfway through (your fish is cooked once it flakes easily), then transfer to a plate and keep the pan for the next step</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat and add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> butter 


Once the butter has melted, foamed and started to brown, pour it into the pickled shallot – this is your brown butter vinaigrette 


Add the chopped parsley and chopped hazelnuts to the potatoes and green vegetables with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and mix them through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cod over the vegetables and spoon the brown butter vinaigrette over


Tip: keep the vinaigrette to the side, adding more to taste if needed


Season with pepper


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
