<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Drain the tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into 12 <span class="text-danger">[24] </span>strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the tofu strips and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Once the tofu is crisp, transfer it to kitchen paper and set aside (reserve the pan for later!) – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, peanut butter, chilli relish and soy sauce in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a jug

Stir it all together – this is your peanut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons, discard the watery seeds

Add the cucumber ribbons to a large bowl and set aside

Add the rice vinegar to the cucumber ribbons and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your cucumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Carefully wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-low heat

Add the peanut stock to the pan and cook for 2-4 min or until thickened slightly – this is your satay sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, add the black sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy tofu over the sesame rice with the cucumber salad to the side

Pour the satay sauce all over the crispy tofu

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
