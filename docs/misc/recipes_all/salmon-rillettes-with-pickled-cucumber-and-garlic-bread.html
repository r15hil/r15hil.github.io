<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Zest your lemon[s] and cut into wedges

Chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives and lemon zest with your soured cream in a small bowl – this is your soured cream & chive dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salmon rillettes with the garlic bread, quick-pickled cucumber, chips and baby leaf salad to the side

Dollop the remaining soured cream & chive dip to the side and garnish with a lemon wedge
