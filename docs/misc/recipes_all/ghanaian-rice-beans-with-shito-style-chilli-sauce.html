<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Pre-heat the grill to high and boil a kettle

Peel the ginger and garlic

Chop the chillies in half lengthways (can't handle the heat? Deseed the chillies!)

Chop 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters and add to tin foil-lined baking tray with the peeled garlic and ginger and the halved chillies

Grill for 8-10 min or until charred then remove and keep to one side to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Carefully add the eggs to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 7 min for perfect mid-boiled eggs

Tip: The salt prevents the eggs from cracking!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Add the charred veg to a food processor with 80ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>cold water and the tomato paste

Season with a generous pinch of salt and sugar

Blitz until you have a chunky sauce – this is your Shito-style chilli sauce

Heat a medium-sized pot (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the red onion has softened, add the basmati rice and spinach and give everything a good mix up

Pour in the stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans

Peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
