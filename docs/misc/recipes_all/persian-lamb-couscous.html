<p><strong>Description:</strong> We’ve created a simple dish here that encompasses all that’s good within Persian cuisine. Our lamb is crisped and flavoured with baharat, a lovely warm Arabic spice mix. Served over cucumber and carrot couscous with plump sultanas. All topped with crunchy toasted pistachios and a dollop of cool minty yoghurt. </p>
