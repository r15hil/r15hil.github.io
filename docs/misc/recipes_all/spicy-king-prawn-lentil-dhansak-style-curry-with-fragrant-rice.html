<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into thin wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<p>Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Add the rinsed lentils to the pan[s] with your ground coriander, ground turmeric, garam masala, tomato paste, tamarind paste and ginger & garlic paste

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water with the crushed cardamom pods to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant rice</p><br><br>

<p>Drain and add your king prawns

Stir it all together and cook, covered, for a final 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the spinach has wilted – this is your spicy king prawn & lentil dhansak-style curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Discard the cardamom pods from the fragrant rice

Serve the spicy king prawn & lentil dhansak-style curry with the fragrant rice to the side

Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top with the green chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
