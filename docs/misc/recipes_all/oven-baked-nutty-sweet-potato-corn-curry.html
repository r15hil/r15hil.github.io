<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat then peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the chopped sweet potato and cook for 1-2 min or until the potato is beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato is browned, add your ginger & garlic paste and garam masala to the dish with your ground turmeric and tomato paste

Add the chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the drained sweetcorn, vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut, peanut butter and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until the sweet potato is cooked through – this is your oven-baked nutty sweet potato & corn curry</p><br><br>

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the oven-baked nutty sweet potato & corn curry in the centre of the table, ready to share, with the baked rice to the side
