<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp – these are your smoky chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Remove 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g] </span><span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter from the fridge to warm up for later

Cut 1 piece of tin foil approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper

Lay half your garlic (skins on) in the middle of the foil, then add a drizzle of olive oil, a small splash of water and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the garlic to form a sealed parcel

Add the garlic parcel to a separate tray and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the garlic is soft

Once soft, carefully remove the skins from the roasted garlic, mash with a fork and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Combine the chopped parsley, chopped garlic and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) with the warmed butter and a generous pinch of salt – this is your cheesy garlic butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Spread the cheesy garlic butter over the outside of the ciabatta lid and the inside of the ciabatta base, then add to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until crusty – this is your garlic bread

Meanwhile, combine the mashed roasted garlic, mayo and your white wine vinegar in a small bowl – this is your roasted garlic aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash, then remove 1 outer leaf per person from your lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper and set aside, then chop the inner core into quarters, lengthways

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, season generously with salt and pepper then give it a good mix up – this is your pulled free range chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your burger, top the garlic bread base with the pulled free range chicken, a drizzle of roasted garlic aioli and a lettuce leaf, then finish with the garlic bread lid

Serve the lettuce quarters with a drizzle of roasted garlic aioli and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Serve the smoky chips and any remaining aioli to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
