<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, until starting to brown and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add half of your Marmite (you'll use the rest later!) to a small bowl with your red chilli relish, peanut butter and soy sauce and mix until combined – this is your Marmite satay sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pork mince has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste and remaining Marmite to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the pork has caramelised, add your udon noodles and spinach to the pan with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water and cook, covered, for 2 min until the spinach has started to wilt and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has wilted, add the Marmite satay sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are coated – this is your Marmite & peanut butter pork udon</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Marmite & peanut butter pork udon in a bowl

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion and chopped peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
