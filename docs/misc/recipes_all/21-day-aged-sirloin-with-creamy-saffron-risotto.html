<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until caramelised

Once caramelised, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml<span class="text-purple"> [950ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water and add your saffron – this is your saffron stock

Once the garlic is fragrant, add your arborio rice to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the saffron stock to the pan with the rice, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Whilst the risotto is cooking, slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Once the risotto has been cooking for 25-30 min, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat your sirloin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt on both sides

Once very hot, add the seasoned sirloin steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side; for medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is cooked, add your Chinese rice wine, most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and your clotted cream

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your creamy saffron risotto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and halved cherry tomatoes to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak

Serve the creamy saffron risotto and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Top with the sliced steak and serve the balsamic salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
