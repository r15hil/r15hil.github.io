<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the butternut squash wedges to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground cumin, ground turmeric, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the butternut squash is cooked through and tender – these are your spiced butternut squash wedges

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nut & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden, then transfer to a small bowl and set aside

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[150ml] </span>boiled water

Once slightly thickened, add the vegetable stock and creamy single soy to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your makhani sauce</p><br><br>
