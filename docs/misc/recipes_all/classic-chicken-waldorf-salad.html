<p><strong>Description:</strong> The history of this iconic salad dates back to 1896 when the Waldorf Hotel in New York concocted this fruity number. Apple, sultanas and grapes are tumbled through a creamy dressing, with walnuts adding earthiness, chicken for protein and croutons for crunch! </p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 350&deg;F/ Gas 4


Heat a large, <span class="text-highlight">wide-based pan</span> (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the chicken thigh fillets with the dried&nbsp;oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min, turning once halfway, until golden on both sides

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dice the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on) into bite-sized pieces


Add the diced apple to a very large bowl with the juice of the remaining lemon


Tip: the lemon juice&nbsp;prevents the apple from going brown!


Add the sultanas to a small bowl and cover them with&nbsp;boiled water (this plumps them up)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut the ciabatta roll<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small, bite-sized pieces&nbsp;


Add the ciabatta&nbsp;to one side of the baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper&nbsp;


Add the walnuts to the other side of the baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until they've darkened slightly in colour and toasted&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, shred the chicken apart in the pan, using two forks - this technique is known as &lsquo;pulling'


Drain the sultanas


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add&nbsp;all of the&nbsp;ingredients, including the creamy dressing, to the large&nbsp;bowl with the apple and&nbsp;give everything a good old mix up - this is your waldorf salad


Serve the waldorf salad


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
