<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if the pan is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Combine the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, Chinese rice wine, soy sauce, a splash of cold water, your red chilli relish and a generous pinch of sugar in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
