<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges, then add them to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the wedges are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, then slice the cucumber as finely as you can

Add the red wine vinegar, yellow mustard seeds, a pinch of<span class="text-danger"> </span>sugar, a splash of boiled water and a pinch of salt to a bowl and stir until dissolved

Add the sliced cucumber to the bowl and give everything a good mix up, then set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

Tip: Give the cucumber an occasional shake while pickling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the turkey mince and soy sauce to a large bowl with a generous pinch of pepper

Knead thoroughly until fully combined (kneading the patties for longer will make them more tender!)

Shape into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>burger patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the burger patties to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Push the patties down with a spatula for even cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Combine the mayo, ketchup and mustard ketchup in a small bowl – this is your burger sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash and shred the gem lettuce finely, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the shredded lettuce and sliced shallot to the bowl of quick-pickled cucumber and gently mix everything together

Drain the excess liquid then add a drizzle of olive oil and give it another mix – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, top the burger patties evenly with the grated cheese and continue to cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the cheese has melted – these are your turkey cheeseburgers</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the turkey cheeseburgers with the crispy onions

Serve with the salad, potato wedges and burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
