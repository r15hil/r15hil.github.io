<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Slice your halloumi into thin strips

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s], then add to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled carrot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your couscous, sultanas, half of your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt to a heatproof bowl with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water, cover and set aside to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), your honey, the juice of half your orange[s] and a generous drizzle of olive oil to a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your orange harissa dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel the remaining<span class="text-danger"> </span>orange and slice into segments

Chop your dill roughly, including the stalks

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the softened couscous with a fork – this is your harissa couscous

Add the salad, harissa couscous, quick-pickled carrot and half of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your couscous salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the couscous salad with the golden halloumi slices over the top

Drizzle over the orange harissa dressing and top with the orange segments and remaining chopped dill – this is your halloumi, couscous & orange salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
