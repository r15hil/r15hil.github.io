<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion is softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger & garlic to the pan with your garam masala, ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground turmeric and half your cumin seeds (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2-3 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water with the chopped creamed coconut and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Once fragrant, add the drained lentils, tomato paste and creamy stock to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil then remove from the heat – this is your dal makhani</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the dal makhani to an oven-proof dish, reserving the pan

Top with the softened sweet potato and a grind of black pepper, then put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is bubbling and the potatoes are golden and cooked through – this is your dal makhani & sweet potato bake</p><br><br>

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to the middle of the foil with a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel (or two!) and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the broccoli is nearly cooked, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> of butter to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until the butter has melted and is foaming

Once foaming, add the remaining cumin seeds and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant – this is your cumin butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the dal makhani & sweet potato bake with the Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Drizzle the cumin butter over the broccoli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
