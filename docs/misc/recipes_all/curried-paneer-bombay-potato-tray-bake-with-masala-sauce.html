<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes and onion wedges to one side of the baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle over your ground turmeric, black mustard seeds and half your curry powder and give everything a good mix up – these are your Bombay potatoes

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your paneer into 4 strips per person

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add half your garam masala (save the rest for later!) to a plate with a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the paneer strips to the plate and turn them several times until fully coated

After the Bombay potatoes have had an initial 15 min, add the coated paneer to the other side of the tray[s] with a drizzle of vegetable oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 12-15 min, or until the potatoes are crispy and golden and the paneer is charred – this is your curried paneer & Bombay potato tray bake

Line a separate baking tray with a large piece of tin foil and add the sliced spring greens to the middle of the foil with a pinch of salt, a knob of butter and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the edges of the foil to form a sealed parcel and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the greens are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion has started to soften

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, remaining curry powder and garam masala to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through half your natural yoghurt – this is your masala sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried paneer on a plate with the Bombay potatoes and spring greens to the side

Spoon the masala sauce over the paneer and drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
