<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [160ml]</span> milk to a bowl with half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened, then add the chicken breast portion[s] to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside for later – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Mix it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>flour to a plate, season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your flour mix

Add the marinated chicken breast portion[s] to the flour mix, then press firmly into the mixture, making sure to evenly coat them on both sides – this is your coated chicken

Discard any remaining marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden brown, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy fried chicken

Reserve the pan and the remaining cooking oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your cayenne pepper and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small heatproof bowl with a pinch of salt

Carefully pour the remaining cooking oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up – this is your chilli oil

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread your mayo on the warmed brioche base, then top with the quick-pickled cucumber discs and crispy fried chicken, then drizzle the chilli oil (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the top

Top with the warmed brioche bun lid and serve the fries and quick-pickled cucumber batons to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
