<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and season generously on both sides with salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is very hot, add the seasoned rump steak[s] and the halved cherry tomatoes

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Transfer the cooked rump steak[s] to a clean plate to rest, and keep the tomatoes in the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to a boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Add a drizzle of olive oil to the spaghetti and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the steak is resting, return the pan to a medium heat and add your tomato paste, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt, sugar and pepper

Cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle of olive oil if your pan is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your dried oregano, halved olives, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce and a splash of the reserved pasta water and cook for 1-2 min further or until thickened – this is your pizzaiola sauce

Add the drained spaghetti to the pizzaiola sauce and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your spaghetti pizzaiola</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spaghetti pizzaiola, topped with your grated Italian hard cheese and the sliced steak

Garnish with the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
