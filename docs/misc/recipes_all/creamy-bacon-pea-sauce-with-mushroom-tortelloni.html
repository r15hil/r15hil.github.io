<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Gradually add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>milk and mix until fully combined – this is your creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add your creamy sauce and blanched peas to the pan, give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil

Cook for 30 secs, or until the sauce has slightly thickened, then add your drained tortelloni to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water

Stir it all together and cook for a final 30 secs or until the sauce is coating the pasta – this is your creamy bacon & pea sauce with mushroom tortelloni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy bacon & pea sauce with mushroom tortelloni topped with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and chopped basil

Drizzle with olive oil and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
