<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, add your giant couscous and diced apricots to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the giant couscous for 8-10 min or until tender with a slight bite and once done, drain the giant couscous over the spinach and return both to the pot

Meanwhile, combine your ras el hanout with a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your basa fillets to the spice mix and turn them several times until they're fully coated in all the spices – this is your coated basa

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
