<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add the rice and 350ml [700ml] water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Toast the spices for 30 seconds, then add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the pan</p><br><br>

Transfer the mixture (keep the pan for step 6) to a processor and blitz until smooth paste - this is your curry paste</p><br><br>
