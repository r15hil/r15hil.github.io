<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands along with a grind of black pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add half your ginger paste (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of sugar

Add the salad and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your ginger salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are brown, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add a large knob of butter and your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your soy sauce and the remaining ginger paste

Cook for 1 min or until the butter has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the butter has melted, add your udon noodles to the pan along with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>cold water and cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are warmed through

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the noodles have warmed through, add half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are evenly coated – these are your cheesy gochujang udon noodles

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the cheesy gochujang udon noodles with the sliced spring onion and remaining grated cheese

Serve the ginger salad and the cooked chicken breast to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
