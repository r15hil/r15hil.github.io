<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min until starting to soften, but not colour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan, stirring to coat the grains of rice in the oil

Add the chopped tomatoes and stir continuously until the rice has absorbed most of the tomato juice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 15-20 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your tomato risotto

Meanwhile, chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Grate the cheddar flavour block</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grind most of the chopped basil (save some for garnish!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with olive oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken and cook for 8 min or until coloured and cooked through (no pink meat!), then season lightly with pepper

Once the risotto is nearly done, add the red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 2 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the cooked chicken and half the grated cheddar flavour block to the tomato risotto and gently stir it all together – this is your tomato & chicken risotto

Serve the tomato & chicken risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining grated cheddar flavour block and chopped basil

Drizzle the basil oil all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
