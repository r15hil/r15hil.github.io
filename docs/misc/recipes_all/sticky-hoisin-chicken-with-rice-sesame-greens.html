<h4>Step 1</h4>

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the flattened chicken to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Cooking for 5? Use two pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the pak choi wedges and spinach to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 3-4 min or until the pak choi is fork tender

Once cooked, add your toasted sesame oil to the bowl with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky hoisin chicken with the cooked rice and sesame greens to the side

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
