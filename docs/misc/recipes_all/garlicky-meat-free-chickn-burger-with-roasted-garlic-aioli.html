<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Remove 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g] </span>butter from the fridge to warm up for later

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp – these are your smoky chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut a piece of tin foil approx. the size of an A4 sheet of paper

Lay 1 garlic clove per person (skin on) in the middle of the foil, then add a drizzle of olive oil, a small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Scrunch the edges of the tin foil together around the garlic to form a sealed parcel

Add the garlic parcel to a separate tray and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the garlic is soft

Once soft, carefully remove the skin from the roasted garlic, mash with a fork and set aside – this is your mashed roasted garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the garlic is roasting, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Combine the chopped parsley, chopped garlic and half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with the warmed butter and a generous pinch of salt – this is your cheesy garlic butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Spread the cheesy garlic butter over the outside of the ciabatta lids and the inside of the ciabatta bases, then add to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until crusty – this is your garlic bread</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your gem lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then separate 1 outer leaf per person and cut the remaining lettuce into quarters, lengthways

Combine the mashed roasted garlic and mayo in a small bowl with your white wine vinegar – this is your roasted garlic aioli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your burger, top each garlic bread base with the meat-free chick'n, a drizzle of roasted garlic aioli and a lettuce leaf, then finish with the garlic bread lid

Serve the lettuce quarters with a drizzle of roasted garlic aioli and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Serve the smoky chips and any remaining aioli to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
