<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel your potatoes and chop into large, bite-sized pieces, then top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into thin batons

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly then top, tail and slice finely, then peel and finely chop your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry and reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, season your free range chicken breast portion[s] with your dried thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, transfer to a baking tray (or two!) and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the carrot batons and a knob of butter to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water

Scrunch the foil around the carrots to form a tightly sealed parcel (or two!) and add to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-14 min or until the carrots are fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your glazed carrots and herby chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chicken stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce starts to thicken

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and crème fraîche – this is your creamy leek sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your buttery mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the free range herby chicken on a clean board

Serve the sliced herby chicken with the buttery mash and glazed carrots to the side

Spoon the creamy leek sauce all over and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
