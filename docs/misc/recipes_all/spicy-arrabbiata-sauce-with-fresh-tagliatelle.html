<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your chilli oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim the ends off your Tenderstem broccoli then chop into thirds

Grate your Italian hard cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your fresh tagliatelle and chopped Tenderstem broccoli to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle and broccoli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the tagliatelle is cooking, add your chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock mix to the pan with the chilli oil

Season with a pinch of salt, sugar and a grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once thickened, add the drained tagliatelle and broccoli to the pan, tear in half your basil (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your spicy arrabbiata sauce with fresh tagliatelle

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy arrabbiata sauce with fresh tagliatelle topped with the grated Italian hard cheese

Tear over the remaining basil

Season with a grind of black pepper and drizzle everything with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
