<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your nigella rice

Once cooked, remove the rice from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high

Cut your hake fillet[s] in half lengthways, and then chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) with your curry powder, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a generous pinch of salt and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl

Add the chopped hake and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your coated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil (to prevent the fish from sticking!)

Add the coated hake to the baking tray[s] and place under the grill for 6-7 min or until the fish is cooked through and starting to char – this is your tandoori hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways

Scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and set aside for later, then dice the deseeded cucumber finely

Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Dice your tomato[es]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the diced cucumber, chopped shallot and diced tomato in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your kachumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the cucumber seeds, remaining natural yoghurt and mint sauce in a separate bowl

Season with a large pinch of salt – this is your mint raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tandoori hake over the nigella rice with the kachumber salad and mint raita to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
