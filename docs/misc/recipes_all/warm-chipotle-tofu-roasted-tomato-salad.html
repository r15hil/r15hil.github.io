<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once golden, transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the tofu into large bite-sized pieces

Add the torn tofu to a bowl with your soy sauce, half your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Drain your sweetcorn

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the halved tomatoes and drained sweetcorn with a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Return the tray to the oven for a final 12-15 min or until the potatoes are cooked through and the sweetcorn is charred – this is your roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the tofu is cooking, combine your mayo, remaining chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cider vinegar in a bowl

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and stir it all together – this is your chipotle dressing

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is cooked, add the roasted veg and crispy tofu to a large bowl with half the chipotle dressing (you'll use the rest later!) and give it a gentle mix up – this is your chipotle tofu & roasted veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chipotle tofu & roasted veg over the baby leaf salad

Drizzle over the remaining chipotle dressing and garnish with your toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
