<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop your potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and halved green beans to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken and green beans are lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potato to a large heatproof bowl, cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 4-6 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and the chopped creamed coconut to the pan with your chicken stock mix and soy sauce, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 5 min further, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the potato is fork-tender, add it to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Malaysian-style chicken thigh & green bean curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Malaysian-style chicken thigh & green bean curry with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
