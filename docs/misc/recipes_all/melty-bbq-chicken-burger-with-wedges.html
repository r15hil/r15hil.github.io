<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the wedges have been in the oven for 10 mins, add the chicken burger patties to a separate tray (use non-stick baking paper to prevent them from sticking!) and put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken burgers have had 12 min, remove the tray from the oven and top them with the grated cheese 


Add the brioche rolls, cut-side up, to the other side of the tray


Return the tray to the oven for 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the burgers are cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your melty chicken burgers</p><br><br>
