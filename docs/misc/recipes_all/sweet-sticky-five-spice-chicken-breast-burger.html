<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and and shred finely

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Add your white wine vinegar to a large bowl with your mayo and a pinch of salt and mix to combine

Add the shredded lettuce and grated carrot and give everything a good mix up – this is your tangy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Bash your chicken breast portion[s] with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your chicken escalopes

Add the chicken escalopes to a bowl with your five-spice mix and cornflour

Give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated in the cornflour mixture – this is your five-spice coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the five-spice coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the chips have been in the oven for 25 min, move them to one side of the tray[s] and add the brioche halves to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the brioche buns are lightly toasted and the chips are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your hoisin sauce to a small pot with your soy sauce, honey and a drizzle of olive oil and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened and sticky – this is your sticky glaze

Tip: Watch carefully to prevent the glaze from burning!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, add it to the sticky glaze one piece at a time and turn to coat evenly – this is your sweet & sticky five-spice chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, fill a brioche bun with the sweet & sticky five-spice chicken, a drizzle of sticky glaze and top with some of the tangy slaw

Serve with the chips and remaining tangy slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
