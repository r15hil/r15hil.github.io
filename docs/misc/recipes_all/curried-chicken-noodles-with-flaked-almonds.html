<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the noodles and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the coconut stock, halved green beans and sultanas to the pan with the chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles and stir it all together

Cook for 3 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried chicken noodles and garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
