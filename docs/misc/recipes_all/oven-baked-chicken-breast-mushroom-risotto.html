<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Wash your leek[s] thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves, then top, tail and slice into rounds</p><br><br>

<p>Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and leek rounds to the casserole dish and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your arborio rice to the dish and stir everything together

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Remove the skin and chop the crushed garlic roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Tear your white cup mushrooms directly into the dish

Add the chopped garlic with your Chinese rice wine and white wine vinegar

Add your chicken stock mix with 600ml <span class="text-purple">[780ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven

Cook everything for 25-30 min or until the rice is cooked with a slight bite and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir your grated Italian hard cheese through the risotto and season with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper – this is your oven baked chicken and mushroom risotto

Serve with the salad to the side

Dig in!</p><br><br>
