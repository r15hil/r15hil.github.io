<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] skin side down, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your mooli slaw mix to a large bowl with the sliced spring onion, half your black sesame seeds (save the rest for later!) and the juice of half your lime[s]

Add the cucumber matchsticks with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your honey to a separate bowl with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) sesame oil, soy sauce and a squeeze of lime juice

Give everything a good mix up – this is your honey sriracha glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the salmon is cooked through, transfer to a clean board (remove the pan from the heat and reserve)

Remove and discard the skin, then break the cooked salmon into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Add the honey sriracha glaze to the reserved pan, off the heat (be careful, the glaze may sizzle from the heat of the oil!) and warm through for 10-20 secs or until thickened to a thin syrup-like consistency

Tip: Add another squeeze of lime juice if the sauce is looking a little thick

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, top each warmed tortilla with a little sesame lime slaw and some salmon pieces

Drizzle the honey sriracha glaze over the tacos then top with the remaining black sesame seeds – these are your honey sriracha salmon tacos

Serve the remaining sesame lime slaw to the side and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
