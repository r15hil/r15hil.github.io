<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned, then remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the juices run clear</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is in the oven, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot (with a matching lid) over a medium heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for 1-2 min further or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chicken stock, chopped potatoes, and a generous pinch of salt to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for an initial 10-12 min or until the potatoes are almost cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your shredded kale and shake off any excess water

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once the potatoes are almost cooked through, add the shredded kale and halved green beans to the pot and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Drain and rinse your butter beans, then add them to the pan with the pulled chicken, your dried oregano and your soft cheese

Stir everything together – this is your chicken & butter bean stew</p><br><br>
