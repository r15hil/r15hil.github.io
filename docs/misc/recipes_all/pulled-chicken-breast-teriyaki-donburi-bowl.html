<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is thickening, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Slice your mangetout in half lengthways

Add the sliced mangetout to a large bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, shred it apart in the pan using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once pulled, mix the pulled chicken into the pan juices – this is your pulled chicken breast teriyaki

Drain the pickled vegetables through a sieve

Drain your mangetout</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pulled chicken breast teriyaki over the cooked rice, with the grated carrot, pickled vegetables and mangetout to the side

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
