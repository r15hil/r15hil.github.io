<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil a kettle

Heat a very large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breasts strips and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice your brown onion[s] finely

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Push the chicken to one side of the pan and reduce the heat to medium-high

Add the sliced onion and pepper strips with a generous pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chestnut mushrooms into quarters

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[455ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [650ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with a pinch of salt and 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the veg is beginning to soften, add the chopped mushrooms, ground paprika and ground smoked paprika to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add the tomato stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and season generously with salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your smoky chicken goulash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chicken goulash in bowls with the cooked rice to the side

Top with a dollop of your soured cream, a good grind of black pepper and the chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
