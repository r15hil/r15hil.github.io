<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast strips, a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 7-8 min, turning halfway, or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain the pineapple, reserving some of the juice for later

Chop the pineapple roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed basmati rice to separate the grains

Add the rice, drained beans and a splash of water and cook for 4 min, stirring regularly, or until warmed through

Once hot, add pineapple chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is almost cooked, add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice, soy sauce and a splash of pineapple juice to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce starts to thicken slightly – this is your Caribbean-style chicken</p><br><br>
