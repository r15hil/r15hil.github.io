<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>Drain and rinse your green lentils

Once the onion has started to soften, add the drained green lentils, your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock mix to the pan

Cook for 2-3 min or until starting to thicken to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your lentil lasagne mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Melt 20g<span class="text-purple"> [30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in a medium-sized pot over a medium heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Layer some of the lentil lasagne mix over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets

Cover with the white sauce, then top with the grated cheese

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the dish to a baking tray, cover with tin foil and cook in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the pasta is cooked

Remove the tin foil and return the dish to the oven for a further 10 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – this is your cheesy lentil lasagne</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the cheesy lentil lasagne to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
