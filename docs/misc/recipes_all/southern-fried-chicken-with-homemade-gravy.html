<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add the ground paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), dried oregano and ground allspice to a plate with 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g] </span>flour

Add a generous pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your flour & spice mix

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a separate bowl and beat with a fork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop each chicken breast into 4 strips

Coat the chicken strips in the flour & spice mix, tap off the excess, then add them into the beaten egg

Once all the chicken pieces are coated in the egg, return them to the remaining flour & spice mix to coat in a second layer – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 8-9 min on each side or until the chicken is crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Southern fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, dissolve the chicken stock mix and Marmite in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Marmite stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a pot over a medium heat and add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter

Once melted, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs until a sandy paste has formed

Add the Marmite stock and cook for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally, until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top, tail and grate the carrots

Trim, then finely slice the spring onions

Add the grated carrot and sliced spring onion to a bowl with the mayo, red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up – this is your slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Southern fried chicken with the chips and slaw to the side

Pour the gravy into pots for dipping and serve to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
