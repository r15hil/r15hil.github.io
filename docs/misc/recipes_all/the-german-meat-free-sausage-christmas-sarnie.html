<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the wedges to one side of the baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then add your meat-free sausages to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous knob of butter, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 12-15 min or until golden and caramelised, then transfer them to a bowl and reserve the pan for later – these are your caramelised onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your Brussels sprouts to a food processor and blitz until roughly chopped

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop them up as finely as you can!

Roughly chop your dried cranberries and grate your apple[s]

Combine the chopped sprouts with the chopped cranberries, grated apple, your mayo, white wine vinegar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Brussels sprout slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium low heat and add your curry powder, smoked paprika, Henderson's Relish, ketchup and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add a splash of cold water and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your curry ketchup

Once the curry ketchup has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free sausages are cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and transfer them to a chopping board to cool slightly

Slice your brioche buns in half and add them to the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the brioche are warmed through and the wedges are golden

Chop the cooked meat-free sausages into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped meat-free sausages to the pan of curry ketchup and give everything a good mix up until well coated

Return the pan to a low heat and cook for 1-2 min to gently reheat – these are your German meat-free sausages</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble your sarnie[s] by piling up the warmed brioche bun[s] with half of the Brussels sprout slaw, then the German meat-free sausages and top with the caramelised onions – this is your German meat-free Christmas sausage sarnie[s]

Serve the wedges and the remaining Brussels sprout slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
