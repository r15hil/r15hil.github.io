<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the salmon fillets to the other side of the tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!), drizzle with vegetable oil and season the skin generously with salt

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove and discard the salmon skin (optional) and serve with the potatoes and beetroot raita to the side

Garnish with the nigella seeds and remaining mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
