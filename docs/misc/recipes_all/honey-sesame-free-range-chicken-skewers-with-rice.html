<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to medium-high then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces (Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess!), then deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Chop half your cucumber and sweet pointed pepper into batons</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add your soy sauce to a large bowl with your maple syrup, half your mayo and half your toasted sesame seeds (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sesame marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer half your sesame marinade to a separate small bowl and set aside

Add the chopped chicken to the large bowl of sesame marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Thread the marinated chicken onto the soaked skewers – these are your chicken skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chicken skewers to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and pull up the edges of the foil to form an open parcel (this will collect any juices!)

Pour the remaining marinade all over and put the tray[s] under the grill for 16-18 min, turning once halfway, until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your maple sesame free range chicken skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While your rice and chicken skewers are cooking, add your rice vinegar to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil, remaining toasted sesame seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your spicy dressing

Add the smashed cucumber and chopped pepper to the spicy dressing and mix it all together, then season with a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt – this is your spicy smashed cucumber salad

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the pepper and cucumber batons plain!</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the maple sesame free range chicken skewers over the cooked rice with the spicy smashed cucumber salad to the side

Drizzle the remaining sesame marinade all over the chicken and rice

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Serve the cucumber and pepper batons to the side with a dollop of the remaining mayo</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
