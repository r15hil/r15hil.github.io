<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your duck leg[s] (including the white duck fat and duck jelly!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 28 min or until the duck legs are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim, then roughly chop your spring onions into batons

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the duck is golden and crispy, remove the tray from the oven and transfer the cooked duck leg[s] to a clean chopping board and roughly shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Discard all the bones</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the spring onion batons and most of the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your five-spice mix, chopped garlic and chopped ginger, then cook for 2-3 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the pulled duck and cook for a further 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer everything to a plate (save the pan!) and set aside until serving – this is your salt & pepper duck

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cooled rice, blanched peas, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce then stir everything together until combined and cook for 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salt & pepper duck over the egg fried rice

Garnish with the remaining chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
