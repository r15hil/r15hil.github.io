<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is cooking, roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the chopped peanuts in a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your chilli peanut crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add your sugar snap peas to the pot with a generous pinch of salt and increase the heat to medium-high

Cook, covered, for a further 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the juice of half your lime[s] and stir it all together – this is your Thai red veg curry

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rice noodles in bowls and pour over the Thai red veg curry

Discard the lemongrass halves

Sprinkle over the chilli peanut crumb and garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
