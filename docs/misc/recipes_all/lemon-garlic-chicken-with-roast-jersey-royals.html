<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs to the pan, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skin has browned and crisped

Once browned, turn the chicken thighs, skin-side up, and cook them for a further 1-2 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once done, add the chicken thighs to the baking tray with the potatoes (reserve the pan and juices for later)

Return the tray to the oven for a further 5-6 min or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Add the trimmed asparagus and a pinch of salt to a pot and cover with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved chicken pan to a medium-low heat with a very generous knob of butter and drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and thyme and cook for 3-4 min or until softened but not browned

Once softened, add the juice of the lemon and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your herby lemon butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the crispy chicken thighs in half and serve with the roasted Jersey Royals potatoes and asparagus to the side

Drizzle the crispy chicken thighs with the herby lemon butter

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
