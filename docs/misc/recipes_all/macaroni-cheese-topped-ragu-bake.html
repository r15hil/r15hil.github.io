<h4>Step 3</h4>

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [300ml]</span> boiled water and stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano and half of the balsamic vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) – this is your beef stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once browned, add the beef stock, grated carrot and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to the beef mince and cook for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your ragù

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the ragù is cooking, melt 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in the reserved pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk into the roux and whisk for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper – this is your béchamel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained macaroni and Dijon mustard to the béchamel and mix well – this is your macaroni cheese

Transfer the ragù to an oven-proof dish (or individual smaller ones) and top with the macaroni cheese

Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your ragù bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and toss through the rocket

Serve the ragù bake with the dressed rocket to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
