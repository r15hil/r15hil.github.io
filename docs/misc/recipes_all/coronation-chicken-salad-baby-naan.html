<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portions and cook for 3 min on each side until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once golden, add a knob of butter, your curry powder and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 1 min further

Reduce the heat to medium-low, add a few splashes of water and your sultanas and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your cucumber[s] in half and slice into half disks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), mustard seeds and a generous drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl

Juice the lime into the bowl and season with salt and pepper - this is your lime & mustard seed dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and shred the chicken apart in the pan, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Once pulled, add your Greek-style yoghurt and mango chutney to the pan and give everything a good mix up - this is your Coronation chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad and sliced cucumber in the lime & mustard seed dressing and divide between 2 <span class="text-purple">[3]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> plates</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the salad with the Coronation chicken and sliced spring onion

Serve the warmed naans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
