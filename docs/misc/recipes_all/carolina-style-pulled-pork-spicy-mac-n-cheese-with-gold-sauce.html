<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel and finely dice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> brown onion, then finely slice the remaining onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the pulled pork joint to an oven-proof dish, draining away half of the juices

Sprinkle over the ground cumin and smoked paprika with 2/3 of the cider vinegar and half the honey (you'll use the rest later!) and rub it into the pork, using the back of a spoon

Cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min, removing the foil for the final 5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork is in the oven, add the macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite and once done, drain and set aside

While the macaroni is cooking, melt 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter in a pan over a medium heat

Reboil half a kettle and grate the cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once melted, add the diced onion and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the onion – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Stir half the grated cheese into the sauce with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> mustard ketchup – this is your béchamel sauce

Add the drained macaroni to the béchamel sauce with a grind of pepper and a pinch of salt and mix everything together

Transfer the cheesy macaroni to an oven-proof dish, reserving the pan (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with the remaining grated cheddar and 1/4 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1/2 tsp]</span> cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-12 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your spicy mac 'n' cheese

While everything's in the oven, wipe down the reserved pan and return it to a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and remaining chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Wash the shredded spring greens, then pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the shredded spring greens to the pan with the chicken stock mix and 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [180ml]</span> boiled water and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until wilted – these are your collard-style greens

Meanwhile, combine the remaining mustard ketchup, remaining honey, remaining cider vinegar, 1/4 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1/2 tsp] </span>cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the smoked sea salt flakes – this is your Carolina-style gold sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Pull the pork apart using two forks and give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled pork

Serve the collard-style greens in a bowl with the spicy mac 'n' cheese and pulled pork to the side

Drizzle the Carolina-style gold sauce over the pulled pork

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
