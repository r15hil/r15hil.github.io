<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your lean beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml] </span>boiled water, then add your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar and mix to combine – this is your spicy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the spicy stock to the lean beef mince

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the lean beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your lean beef chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are done, push them into<span class="text-danger"> </span>1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with the lean beef chilli and then the grated cheese and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
