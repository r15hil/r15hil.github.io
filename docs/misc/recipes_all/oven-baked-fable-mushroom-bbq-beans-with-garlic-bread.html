<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Peel and finely grate your garlic

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and cut into wedges

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium, then add the onion wedges and tomato paste to the dish with the half the grated garlic, half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), ground smoked paprika, ground coriander and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water and the drained cannellini beans to the dish with a generous pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once boiling, put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 25-30 min or until the sauce has thickened – these are your Fable mushroom BBQ beans

Combine the remaining grated garlic with a<span class="text-danger"> </span>knob of butter per person in a bowl with a pinch of pepper – this is your garlic butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the Fable mushroom BBQ beans are almost ready, spread the garlic butter all over the ciabatta halves (reserve the bowl!)

Add the buttered ciabatta halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-7 min or until golden and crisp – this is your garlic bread

Combine your mayo and remaining white wine vinegar in the reserved bowl – this is your ranch dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Shred the Fable mushrooms apart, using two forks and give everything a good mix up

Sprinkle your smoked sea salt flakes over the Fable mushroom BBQ beans and serve the lettuce to the side

Drizzle the ranch dressing over the lettuce and Fable mushroom BBQ beans and serve the garlic bread to the side
