<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Boil a full kettle, then chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Pat the pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub it with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned pork and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until it is browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pork loin is cooked, transfer to a plate and set aside

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and cook for 2 min

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, then add 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>water and your soft cheese and give everything a good mix up

Add the cracked black pepper, Chinese rice wine and Dijon mustard and bring to the boil over a high heat, then add any resting juices from the plate with the steak and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your peppercorn sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is thickening, trim, then add your green beans to a separate pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and season with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain the green beans and return them to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add a knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt to the drained potatoes

Crush the potatoes lightly with a masher or the back of a fork – these are your crushed potatoes

Tip: Don't press too hard, you only want to crush them!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork loin steak over the peppercorn sauce with the crushed potatoes and green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
