<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop in half lengthways

Cut each half in two through the centre, so you end up with 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>pieces per person

Tip: Trim a little aubergine skin off each piece, this will make it easier for the breadcrumbs to stick!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with your grated Italian hard cheese and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and mix it all together - this is your cheesy panko breadcrumbs

Combine 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl with 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[</span>6 tbsp]</span> cold water – this is your flour mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Coat the aubergine pieces in the flour mixture, then press into the cheesy panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over

Add the coated aubergine to a baking paper-lined tray and add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the trays with the fries and the aubergine in the oven for an initial 20 min or until crispy and golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your garlic

Combine the grated garlic, tomato paste and half your oregano (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with 1 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp] </span>[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Slice the drained mozzarella into 2<span class="text-danger"> </span>slices per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your basil as finely as you can, including the stalks

Combine the chopped basil and mayo in a bowl – this is your basil mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After the initial 20 min, remove the trays from the oven

Sprinkle the remaining dried oregano over the fries and push them to one side, then add the mozzarella slices to the other side of the tray[s] and top each one with a dollop of tomato sauce – these are your saucy mozzarella slices

Add the brioche halves to the baking tray with the aubergine, cut side up

Return the trays to the oven for 4-5 min or until the brioche is warmed through and the mozzarella has melted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, add a handful of salad, then a saucy mozzarella slice to the toasted brioche base, then layer with the crispy aubergine and repeat the process

Spread the basil mayo over the toasted brioche lid and top the burger – this is your aubergine parmigiana burger

Serve the oregano fries and remaining salad to the side, then drizzle a little olive oil over the salad with a grind of black pepper and enjoy!</p><br><br>
