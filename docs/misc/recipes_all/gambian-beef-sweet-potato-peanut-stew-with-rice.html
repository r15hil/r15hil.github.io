<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced beef with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into thin wedges

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces

Slice your red chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Decrease the heat to medium-high and add the onion wedges, chopped sweet potato and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the dish

Add your curry powder, ground paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 480ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[620ml]</span> [810ml] </span>boiled water with your tomato paste, peanut butter and your beef stock mix

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 60 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through – this is your Gambian-style beef & sweet potato peanut stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the stew has had 30 min, reboil the kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Gambian-style beef & sweet potato peanut stew over the cooked rice

Sprinkle over the reserved sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
