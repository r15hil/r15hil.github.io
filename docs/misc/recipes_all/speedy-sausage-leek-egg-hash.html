<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Cut your waxy potatoes (skins on) into very small chunks

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a low heat

Once melted, add the sliced leek with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the leeks are softening, score your sausages by drawing the knife lengthwise along the sausage – but don't cut all the way through!

Peel the skins away from the sausages and discard (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, increase the heat to medium and add the sausage meat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

Cook for 4 min or until the sausage meat is brown and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once cooked, add the drained potatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until brown and crispy

Tip: Stir as little as possible to give the potatoes a chance to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Once the potatoes have browned, stir most of the chopped chives (save some for garnish!) into the pan, then serve up onto plates (keep the pan for the next step!) – this is your sausage & leek hash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack them for a perfectly centred yolk</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fried egg over the sausage & leek hash with your mustard ketchup to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
