<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/ 200ºC (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into thick chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min, then drain (reserve the pot!) and shake them around the colander to fluff up the edges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the chips have 10 min left, remove them from the oven, then shake and turn them and return them to the oven until crispy and golden

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your meat-free patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on each side or until the burger is cooked through and lightly charred</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free patty with the twice cooked chips and lettuce wedges to the side

Top the lettuce wedges with the sliced orange and sliced shallot and drizzle the mustard vinaigrette over the top

Dollop the cranberry & orange relish over the patty and serve the truffle mayo to the side with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
