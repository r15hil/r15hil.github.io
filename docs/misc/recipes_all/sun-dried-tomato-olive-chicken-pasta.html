Once hot, add the chicken thigh fillets and cook for 3-4 min, turning once half way, until they're golden on both sides


Add the sun-dried tomatoes to a bowl, cover them with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and leave them to soak</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Shave the Italian hard cheese with a peeler until you end up with a pile of 'cheese shavings' and grate any remaining cheese


Chop the basil finely, including the stalks


Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl - this is your balsamic dressing&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, shred it&nbsp;apart in the pan, using two forks - this technique is known as &lsquo;pulling'


Add the black olives and chopped basil


Season with a pinch of&nbsp;salt and pepper and add the drained linguine&nbsp;


Tip: if the sauce looks a bit dry add some of the starchy pasta water&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash and dry&nbsp;the rocket&nbsp;then tumble it&nbsp;with the&nbsp;cheese shavings and the balsamic dressing


Serve the fresh tomato &amp; chicken ragu&nbsp;and garnish with the remaining&nbsp;grated cheese


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
