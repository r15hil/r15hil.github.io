<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min, then drain the soaked noodles

Meanwhile, cut your lime[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] with half of your red Thai curry paste (save the rest for later!) and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan and cook for 6-7 min, turning the salmon once halfway</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the salmon is cooking, add your soy sauce to a bowl along with your toasted sesame oil, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining red Thai curry paste and juice of the remaining lime

Give everything a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli sauce

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan with the salmon and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped spring onion, chopped green beans and half of your chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 30 secs further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the lime & chilli sauce and cook for 2 min until the green beans have softened slightly and the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Transfer the cooked salmon to a plate and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles to the pan with the sauce and give everything a good mix up – these are your lime & chilli noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your lime & chilli noodles with the zingy salmon over the top

Tear over your coriander leaves and garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
