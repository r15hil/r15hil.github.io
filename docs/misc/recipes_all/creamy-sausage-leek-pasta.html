<p><strong>Description:</strong> This comforting pasta dish uses the classic British flavours of Cumberland sausage and leek. We've used shaoxing wine to flavour the dish, a type of Chinese rice wine, which cooks out any alcohol, so it can be enjoyed by the whole family! </p>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat with 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter


Once melted, gradually stir in 15g <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> plain flour and cook for 1 min, stirring constantly


You should end up with a sandy textured, honey coloured paste - this is your roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whisk&nbsp;200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk gradually into the roux


Cook&nbsp;for 3 min, stirring continuously, until a smooth fairly loose sauce forms, then remove it from the heat and stir in the cheddar and clotted cream - this is your cheesy sauce


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the cooked pasta, sausage and leek into the cheesy sauce&nbsp;


Serve the pasta in bowls with a good grind of pepper&nbsp;


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
