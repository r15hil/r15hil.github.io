<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Add your blanched peas to a colander and rinse under cold running water to refresh them</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the courgette ribbons and refreshed peas to a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your courgette & pea salad

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your sliced prosciutto to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your sliced prosciutto every 30 secs to prevent it from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>
