<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs

Add your sliced potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (the salt prevents them from cracking) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 9-10 min for hard-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onions[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add your curry powder to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – these are your curried onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop your cooled egg[s]

Chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your cornflour, chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Wash your spinach then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the curried onions are fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, add the chopped egg, chopped basa, blanched peas and spinach to the pan, stir everything together until fully combined and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your curry fish pie mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has wilted, transfer the curry fish pie mix to an oven-proof dish (use individual oven dishes for fancy presentation!)

Arrange the softened potato discs on top (they will be hot!), then put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce is bubbling and golden – this is your creamy 'kedgeree' basa pie

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy 'kedgeree' basa pie

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
