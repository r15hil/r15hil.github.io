<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add your tomato paste and drained cannellini beans with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the trimmed green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a very small knob of butter

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potato has had an initial 15-16 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully slice in half down the middle (careful, it will be hot!)

Spoon the homemade cheesy beans over your baked potato[es] and top with the torn mozzarella

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 7-8 min or until melted and oozy – this is your jacket potato with homemade cheesy beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the jacket potato with homemade cheesy beans with the green beans to the side

Sprinkle the Italian hard cheese shavings over the beans and season with a generous grind of black pepper
