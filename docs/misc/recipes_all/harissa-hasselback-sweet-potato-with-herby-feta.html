<p><strong>Description:</strong> Hasselbacking is a tasty Swedish technique. It creates nooks and crannies in your sweet potatoes so you can jam-pack them with sweet, spicy harissa-honey glaze. Serve with herby pilaf, feta dip and crunchy pumpkin seeds for a flavour explosion in every bite.

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut narrow slices (about 1cm apart) into your sweet potato[es], making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – this is your hasselback sweet potato

Transfer the hasselback sweet potato[es] to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cover the tray tightly with tin foil and put in the oven for an initial 45 min

After 45 min, remove the tray from the oven, remove the tin foil and drizzle over your honey and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Return the tray to the oven, uncovered, for 10 min further or until the potato is soft and caramelised – this is your harissa & honey hasselback sweet potato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 8-10 min or until caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the onions are cooking, chop your pumpkin seeds coarsely 

Crumble your Greek cheese into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped pumpkin seeds and cumin seeds in a bowl with your ground sumac and black sesame seeds – this is your pumpkin seed crumble

Add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with the crumbled Greek cheese, chopped parsley, chopped mint and a grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your herby Greek cheese dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the onions are caramelised, add the spinach and cook for 3-4 min or until wilted

Once wilted, add the cooked basmati rice to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your caramelised onion rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa & honey hasselback sweet potato with the herby Greek cheese dip and caramelised onion rice to the side

Sprinkle over the pumpkin seed crumble

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
