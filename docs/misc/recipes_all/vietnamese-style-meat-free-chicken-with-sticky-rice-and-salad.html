<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meat-free chick'n along with any remaining Vietnamese-style marinade from the bowl and cook for 6-7 min or until warmed through and starting to brown – this is your Vietnamese-style meat-free chick'n</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky rice with the Vietnamese-style meat-free chick'n on top and the crunchy salad to the side

Garnish with the chopped mint
