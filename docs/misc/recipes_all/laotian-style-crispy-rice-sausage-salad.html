<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 5 min – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

Once done, transfer the sticky rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the sushi rice is cooking, peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and peel and grate the garlic

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine half the soy sauce and half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl with half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, the rice vinegar, 1/2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and a drizzle of vegetable oil – this is your chilli-lime dressing

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash the gem lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper, remove 6 <span class="text-danger">[12] </span>leaves and set aside then shred the inner core

Cut the cucumber into batons and roughly chop the roasted peanuts

Combine the sticky rice and red Thai curry paste in a bowl with the chopped shallot, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar, the remaining soy sauce and grated garlic

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky rice mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Shape the sticky rice mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> balls

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the rice balls and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crispy

Once done, transfer to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy sausage meat

Meanwhile, combine the shredded lettuce, cucumber batons and half the chopped coriander & mint (save the rest for garnish!) with half the chilli- lime dressing – this is your zesty salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the outer lettuce leaves in bowls topped with the zesty salad, spicy sausage meat and crispy rice balls

Top with the remaining chopped coriander & mint and chopped peanuts

Drizzle over the remaining chilli-lime dressing and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
