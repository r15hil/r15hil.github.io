Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the spiced basa pieces and cook for 3-4 min each side, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cajun-style rice  topped with the spiced basa pieces and drizzle over the lime mayo

Garnish with the lime wedges and season with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
