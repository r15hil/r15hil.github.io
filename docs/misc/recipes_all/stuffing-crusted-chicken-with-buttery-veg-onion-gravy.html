<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle, then chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a large knob of butter to a bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [180ml] </span>boiled water

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Once the butter has melted, add your panko breadcrumbs and dried sage to the bowl with the grated cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up, then set aside to absorb – this is your cheese & sage stuffing mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp - these are your roasties

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a clean chopping board, then slice through the thickest part, being careful not to cut all the way through, and open out like a book

Cover the chicken with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until it is of even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken

Top the butterflied chicken with the cheese & sage stuffing mixture, then press it down gently to coat the surface of the chicken – this is your stuffing crusted chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the stuffing crusted chicken (stuffing side down first) and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crispy

Once crispy, add the stuffing crusted chicken to a baking tray and add it to the oven for 12-14 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!), reserve the pan and oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the carrot discs and sliced leek with a small knob of butter, a pinch of salt and 120ml <span class="text-purple">[160ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until the carrot is tender with a slight bite - this is your buttery carrot & leek</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min, stirring frequently, until you're left with a sandy paste

Whisk in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water with your chicken stock mix, Marmite, onion marmalade and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your onion gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the stuffing crusted chicken over the buttery carrot & leek with the roasties to the side

Drizzle the onion gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
