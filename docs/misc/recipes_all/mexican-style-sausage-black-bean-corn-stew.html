<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and soy sauce in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[680ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse your black beans and sweetcorn

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Once the sausages are browned, add the onion wedges and cook for a further 4-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add 2/3 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>flour with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat?

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the tomato stock with the drained sweetcorn, drained beans and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 9-10 min or until the sauce is starting to thicken and the sausages are cooked through – this is your Mexican-style sausage & corn stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the stew is cooking, add the remaining chopped coriander to a small bowl with a knob of butter and the remaining garlic

Put the bowl in the microwave for 15-20 secs or until starting to melt

Once melted, mix to combine – this is your garlic herb butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, spread the garlic herb butter on the toasted ciabatta halves – this is your garlic herb ciabatta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style sausage & corn stew with the garlic herb ciabatta to the side

Dollop over your soured cream and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
