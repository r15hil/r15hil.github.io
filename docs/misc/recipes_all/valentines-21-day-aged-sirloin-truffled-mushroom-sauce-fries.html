<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Add a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until the oil is very hot

Meanwhile, chop the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Pat the fries dry with kitchen paper

Tip: This helps the fries get extra crispy!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the oil is very hot, remove the tray from the oven and carefully add the fries to the oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a gentle mix up until the fries are coated in the oil

Return the tray to the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the sirloin steaks to the pan

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side

For medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a plate to rest (reserve the pan)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the steak is cooking, add the Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the steak is resting, return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the oyster mushrooms and cook for 3 min or until caramelised

Once caramelised, add the beef stock and clotted cream and cook for 1-2 min further or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency

Add the truffle oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your truffled mushroom sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sirloin steak with the fries and Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Drizzle the truffled mushroom sauce over the steak

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
