<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chicken thighs to a bowl with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), then add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix to combine – this is your Peruvian-style chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Add the Peruvian-style chicken to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and add the halved pepper to the other side

Add a drizzle of olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, transfer the cooked rice to a plate and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your shallot[s],<span class="text-danger"> </span>add them to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems (discard the stems!) and chop the leaves roughly

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (reserve a few leaves for garnish)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your chickpeas and cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the chopped tomato to the quick-pickled shallot with the drained chickpeas, chopped herbs and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your chickpea salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken and pepper have been in the oven for 12 min, remove the pepper from the tray, then return the tray to the oven for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the roasted pepper and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to a food processor and blitz until smooth

Add your mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to blitz until fully combined – this is your aji amarillo-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium-low heat with a small knob of butter, the remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Return the cooked rice to the pot and cook for 1 min further – this is your garlic butter rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Peruvian-style chicken over the aji amarillo-style sauce with the chickpea salad and garlic butter rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
