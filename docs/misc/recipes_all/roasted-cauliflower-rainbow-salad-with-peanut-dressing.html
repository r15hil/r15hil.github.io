<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add to a large bowl with your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and half the chopped herbs (save the rest for garnish!)

Add half the peanut dressing (you'll use the rest later!) to the bowl and toss – this is your rainbow salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Drizzle over the remaining peanut dressing and garnish with the remaining chopped herbs, chopped peanuts and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
