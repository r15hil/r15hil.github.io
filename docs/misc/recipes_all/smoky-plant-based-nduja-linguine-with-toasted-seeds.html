<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, chopped pepper and chopped courgette to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion is starting to brown

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the vegetables are softened, stirring occasionally</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nut & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden – these are your toasted seeds

Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and set aside</p><br><br>
