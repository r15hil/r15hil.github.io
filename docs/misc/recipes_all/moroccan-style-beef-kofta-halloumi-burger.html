<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ras el hanout, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your ras el hanout roasties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and grate half your red onion[s]

Cut the remaining onion into wedges

Add your beef mince to a bowl with the grated onion, ground coriander, half your ground cumin (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt

Using clean hands, give everything a good mix up until fully combined, then roll the burger mixture into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>meatball per person and press down with your hands to form a patty – this is your beef kofta patty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Add the onion wedges to one side of a baking tray lined with tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the onion is beginning to soften

While the onion is in the oven, cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander and parsley roughly, including the stalks and cut your lemon[s] in half

Add the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), chopped parsley and coriander to a pestle & mortar with a small pinch of salt and grind to a paste

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of the lemon[s] and the remaining ground cumin and stir it all together – this is your zhoug</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Cut your halloumi in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)

After the initial 10 min, remove the tray with the onion from the oven and add the chopped Tenderstem and halved halloumi with a little drizzle of olive oil

Return the tray to the oven for a final 12 min or until the halloumi is beginning to brown and the Tenderstem is charred and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving, reserving the pan

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then once hot, add the beef kofta patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on one side

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the toasted brioche base with your mayo, then add the beef kofta patty, a baked halloumi slice, a big dollop of zhoug (save a little for the salad!) and a toasted brioche lid – this is your Moroccan-style beef kofta & halloumi burger

Add the rocket to the side with the charred Tenderstem and roasted red onion wedges and drizzle over the remaining zhoug

Serve the ras el hanout roasties to the side and enjoy!</p><br><br>
