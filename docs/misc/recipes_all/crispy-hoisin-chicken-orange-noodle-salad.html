<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Add your diced chicken thigh to a bowl with your cornflour and a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together until fully coated – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and set aside, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your orange[s] in half

Peel half the orange (you'll use the rest later!) removing all the white pith, then slice into segments</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your ginger & garlic paste and hoisin sauce in a bowl with your rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), soy sauce, the juice of the remaining orange and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your hoisin & orange sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add the drained noodles and orange segments to the pan with the hoisin & orange sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your hoisin chicken thigh, orange & mangetout noodles

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hoisin chicken thigh, orange & mangetout noodles in a bowl

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
