<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the tofu lengthways into 2 slices per person and score a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through each slice (be careful not to cut all the way through!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your tomato paste and soy sauce with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, chopped pepper and olives to the remaining marinade and give everything a good mix up – these are your marinated vegetables

Transfer the marinated vegetables to the baking tray[s] with the tofu and reserve the bowl

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through and starting to char</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, wipe the reserved bowl clean with kitchen paper

Combine your mayo, remaining garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), remaining red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt in the reserved bowl – this is your aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once your marinated vegetables are cooked through and charred, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the spinach to the baking tray[s] and return to the oven for a final 1-2 min, or until wilted – this is your one tray Spanish-style tofu & pepper bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one tray Spanish-style tofu & pepper bake and drizzle with the aioli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
