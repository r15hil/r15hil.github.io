<h4>Step 4</h4>

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Add the lime zest and half of the chopped chilli (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked rice and give it a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Squeeze the juice of half the zested lime over the Keralan-style squash curry and serve it with the lime & chilli rice to the side
