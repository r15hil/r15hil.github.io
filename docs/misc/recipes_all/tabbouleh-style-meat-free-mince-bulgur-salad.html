<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once tender, drain and set aside in a sieve to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Carefully discard any excess oil from the pan, then stir in your ras el hanout and cook for 1 min

Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and add a splash of cold water, then give everything a good mix up

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the meat-free mince is cooked through</p><br><br>

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
