<p><strong>Description:</strong> Chef Alice took inspiration for this hearty winter warmer from a blustery, leafy day. A breeze to cook, the sausages, red onions and potatoes are baked together on the same tray. The crispy sage leaves are the only part of this recipe where you need a little concentration. </p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240&deg;C/ 220&deg;C (fan)/ 475&deg;F/ Gas9

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place the potatoes, sausages and onions on an oven tray, coat well with 2-4 tbsp of olive oil and season to your taste with salt and pepper


Tip: You may need to use more than one tray, you want the vegetables to have some space inbetween them!


Put in the oven for 25-35 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel the apples


Cut them into similar sized chunks (approx. 3cm) cubes


Discard the core&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the apple to a pot with 200ml <span class="text-danger">(300ml)</span> of cold water

<h4>Step 5</h4>
