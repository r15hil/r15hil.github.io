<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine half your dried thyme (you'll use the rest later!) and your ground smoked paprika in a bowl with the cubed potatoes, lemon zest, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your marinated potatoes

Transfer the marinated potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your smoky, lemon & thyme potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the halved ciabatta to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10 min or until the ciabatta is golden and crisp – these are your crisp breads</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, combine half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] in a bowl with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your baby leaf salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad and chopped tomato to the bowl and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the ciabatta is golden and crisp, remove the tray[s] from the oven and set aside to cool slightly, then rub the sliced-side of the chopped garlic over it (not a fan of raw garlic? Only use a little!)

Top with the crumbled goats' cheese, drizzle over the remaining honey, your truffle oil (not a fan of truffle oil? Just add a little!) and the remaining dried thyme

Season with a pinch of pepper – these are your goats' cheese montaditos</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are nearly ready, put the tray[s] with the goats' cheese montadito in the oven and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly melted

Once slightly melted, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top with your sliced prosciutto – these are your prosciutto, truffled honey & goats' cheese montadito</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the prosciutto, truffled honey & goats' cheese montadito with the dressed salad and smoky, lemon & thyme potatoes to the side

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
