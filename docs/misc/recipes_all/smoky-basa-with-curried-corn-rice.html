<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice has cooked, remove it from the heat


Tip: add a splash or two of water if it looks too dry


Add a large knob of butter and season very generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Stir the chopped coriander through - this is your buttered corn rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fish over the buttered corn rice&nbsp;


Grind some pepper over&nbsp;
