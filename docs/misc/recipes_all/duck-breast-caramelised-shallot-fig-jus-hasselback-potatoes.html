<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Prepare the potatoes


Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 400°F/ Gas 6. Boil a kettle.


Cut narrow slices (the width of a pound coin) into the waxy potatoes, but don't cut all the way down to the base – these are your hasselback potatoes. (Rest the potatoes on a wooden spoon to prevent from cutting all the way through).


Add the hasselback potatoes to a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper. Strip the thyme leaves, discarding the stems and sprinkle the leaves over the potatoes. Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 minutes.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Render the duck skin


Using a sharp knife, score the duck skin on a diagonal, being careful not to cut through to the meat. Season with a pinch of salt.


Add the scored duck, skin-side down, to a cold, dry pan over a low-medium heat.


Cook for 10-15 minutes, skin-side down only, or until the skin is golden and crispy and the fat under the skin rendered. Reserve the duck fat for your potatoes.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Roast the duck breasts


Once golden, transfer the duck, skin-side up, to a separate baking tray.


Put the tray into the oven for 10-12 minutes for medium. Cook for 3-5 minutes further if you prefer your duck well done.


Once cooked, set the duck aside, cover, and leave rest for at least 10 minutes.


Once the potatoes have been in for 20 minutes, drizzle the reserved duck fat over and return them to the oven for 15-20 minutes or until tender and crispy.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Start the caramelised shallot &amp; fig jus


<span class="text-highlight">While the potatoes are in the oven, peel a</span>nd halve the shallots, discard the skins.


Dissolve the Knorr chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Caramelise the shallots


Heat a pot with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat.


Once the pot is hot, add the shallot halves, cut side down cook for 3-4 minutes or until starting to caramelise.


Add the balsamic vinegar with the bay leaves and rosemary and season with a pinch of black pepper and cook for 30 seconds.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reduce the sauce


Add the chicken stock to the pot and increase the heat to high.


Cook for 6-8 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by half and coats the back of a spoon, then remove the rosemary and bay leaves and discard.


Stir in the fig relish and a large knob of butter and cook for 1 minute or until thick and glossy – this is your caramelised shallot &amp; fig jus.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Make your garlic broccoli


Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic.


Return the duck pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter. Once melted, add the sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and black pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant.


Add the Tenderstem broccoli with a splash of boiled water cook, covered, for 4-5 minutes or until tender with a slight bite – this is your garlic Tenderstem broccoli.


Tip: Drain any excess water from your broccoli before serving.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Slice the rested duck breasts in half lengthways.


Serve the sliced duck over the caramelised shallot &amp; fig jus with the hasselback potatoes and garlic Tenderstem broccoli to the side.


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
