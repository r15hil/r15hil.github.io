<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the coated basa to the pan

Cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy fish

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to use 2 pans or do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While your fish is cooking, slice your green chilli[es] finely

Remove the base of your lettuce

Wash your lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves

Set 3 lettuce leaves aside per person, then chop the remaining lettuce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous pinch of salt in a medium bowl

Add your chopped lettuce and carrot & cabbage slaw mix and give everything a good mix up – this is your slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining white wine vinegar and honey with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small heatproof bowl

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 20-30 secs or until the butter is melted

Give it a good mix up – this is your chipotle hot honey

Once the fish is cooked, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, divide the lettuce leaves and slaw between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with the crispy fish and a generous drizzle of the chipotle hot honey – these are your baja-style fish tacos with chipotle hot honey

Garnish with the sliced chillies (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
