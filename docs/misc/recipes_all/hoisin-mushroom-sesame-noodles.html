<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble in your chestnut mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until they're starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until they're fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-7 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and set aside in a bowl and reserve the pot for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your spring greens then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), hoisin sauce, soy sauce and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml] </span>cold water to the pan

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min further or until the mushrooms are coated in a sticky sauce – these are your hoisin mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hoisin mushrooms over the sesame noodles

Garnish with the chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and sliced spring onion
