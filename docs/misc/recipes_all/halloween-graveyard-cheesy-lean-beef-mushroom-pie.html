<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes, then slice 1/5 of the potato[es] (you'll use the rest later!) into thin discs and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the potato discs in the oven for 10-12 min or until beginning to brown – these are your potato tombstones</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, reboil half a kettle

Chop your mushrooms roughly

Increase the heat to high and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the mince is browning, dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste and Henderson's Relish

When your mince has browned, add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of milk, then mash until smooth

Grate your cheddar cheese over the top of the lean beef & mushroom filling and top with the mashed potato, then push the potato tombstones in so they're standing upright

Put the pie in the oven for 15-20 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pie is bubbling and golden – this is your Halloween graveyard cheesy lean beef & mushroom pie</p><br><br>
