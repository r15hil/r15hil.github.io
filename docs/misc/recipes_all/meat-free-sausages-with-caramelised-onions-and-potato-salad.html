<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the meat-free sausages to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until they are browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sausages are in the oven, peel and finely slice the red onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt

Cook for 5 min, or until the onion has softened</p><br><br>

Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cook the onions for a further 20 min, or until they're sticky and sweet – these are your caramelised onions</p><br><br>
