<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes, then add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are brown and crispy – these are your crispy paprika potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!), panko breadcrumbs, Henderson's Relish, soy sauce, dried oregano and dried sage in a bowl with a small pinch of salt and black pepper

Divide the mixture and shape into 1 patty per person, press them down with your hands and refrigerate until later – this is your herby pork patty[ies]

Tip: Chilling the patty[ies] helps it hold it's shape whilst cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with your cider vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the herby pork patty[ies] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Keep pressing the patty down with a spatula to keep it flat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove the tray[s] with the potatoes from the oven and push the potatoes to one side

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them, cut side down, to the other side of the tray[s] and put back in the oven for 4-5 min to warm through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the herby pork patty[ies] is cooked, transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm – this is your herby pork burger[s]

Keep the pan (and any remaining oil from the burger!) for the next step</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add a drizzle of vegetable oil

Crack your egg[s] into the pan and season with a pinch of salt

Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, fill the warmed brioche with some mustard ketchup, a herby pork burger, a fried egg and a sprinkling of crispy onions – this is your herby pork & egg burger

Serve the herby pork & egg burger with the crispy paprika potatoes and the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
