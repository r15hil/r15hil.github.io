<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the pepper strips to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce, tamarind paste and fish sauce in a bowl with the juice of half the lime[s], 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> water – this is your pad Thai sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add the chopped garlic with your ginger paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, push the chicken and pepper to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once scrambled, add the drained rice noodles and pad Thai sauce to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your chicken pad Thai noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken pad Thai noodles topped with the chopped peanuts, sliced spring onion and chopped coriander

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
