<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the aubergines are cooking, peel the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop very roughly

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop the ginger and garlic roughly

Separate the coriander leaves from their stalks and set them aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped onion, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), curry powder and coriander stalks (reserve the leaves for garnish!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth or very finely chopped – this is your Sri Lankan-style curry paste

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Add the red wine vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your coconut stock

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until a thick sauce remains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergines are soft, transfer them to a clean board and carefully slice in half lengthways

Scoop out the soft aubergine flesh with a spoon and chop into bite-sized pieces, discard the skins

Add the chopped aubergine flesh to the pan, season with salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your Sri Lankan-style aubergine curry

Chop the reserved coriander leaves roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sri Lankan-style aubergine curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the crispy onions and chopped coriander leaves
