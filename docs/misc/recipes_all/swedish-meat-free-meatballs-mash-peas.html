<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C(fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces (peel your spuds for extra smooth mash!)

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam-dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the meat-free mince with half the vegetable stock mix (you'll use the rest later) and a generous pinch of pepper

Mix thoroughly with clean hands until fully combined, then shape into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> meatballs

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the meat-free meatballs to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil, then put the dish in the oven for 10-15 min or until the meatballs have browned

Meanwhile, combine the remaining vegetable stock mix, wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!), Henderson's Relish and redcurrant jelly in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Add the dried cranberries to a bowl and cover with boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir until sandy paste forms

Gradually whisk in the stock and cook for 2-3 min until the stock has slightly thickened – this is your sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce thickens, chop the dill finely, including the stalks

Add most of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to the thickened sauce

Return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 5 min further until the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – these are your Swedish-style meat-free meatballs & gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Return the pot of drained potatoes to a low heat and add a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Mash until smooth, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Drain the cranberries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Swedish meat-free meatballs over the gravy with the mash and refreshed peas to the side

Garnish with the cranberries and remaining chopped dill

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
