<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your coconut flakes and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once toasted, transfer the toasted coconut flakes to a bowl, reserve the pan

Add the chopped mint to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and grated carrot to a pot with a lid with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat, mix through your chopped dates and keep covered until serving – this is your date rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato to the pan with the tomato stock and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened

Once thickened, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for a further 4-5 min or until cooked through – this is your mild king prawn curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mild king prawn curry over the date rice

Garnish with the coconut crumb
