<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and sliced shallot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has started to soften, add your ground cumin and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your chopped tomatoes to the pan with the drained black beans and your vegetable stock mix

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>cold water and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, grate your lighter cheese finely

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the chopped coriander stalks and stir together – this is your enchilada filling

Divide 3/4 of the enchilada filling (save the rest for later!) between your tortillas, covering only half of each tortilla

Roll up your tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy baked veggie enchiladas drizzled with your natural yoghurt

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
