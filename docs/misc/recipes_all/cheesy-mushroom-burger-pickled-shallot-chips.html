<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms straight into the pan and cook for 8-12 min or until very crisp

Tip: Don't undercook the mushrooms or they will retain too much water, making your patties go soggy!

Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar with a pinch of salt in a bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and slice your shallots very finely

Add the sliced shallot to the vinegar and give everything a good mix up, then set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled shallots

Once the mushrooms are crisp, add your soy sauce and a large knob of butter to the pan and cook for 2 min further

Once done, remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your brioche buns to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 5-6 min or until warmed through

Once warmed through, remove the buns from the oven and slice them in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs, grated cheese and cooked mushrooms to a food processor with a generous grind of black pepper and blitz until smooth

Shape the cheesy mushroom mixture into a patty[ies] for per person

Tip: Use flour on your hands if it's too sticky to handle and aim for the patties to be flat and wide (a little wider than the brioche buns if possible!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the cheesy mushroom patties to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned and crispy

Tip: Remember to handle gently as the patties may be fragile!

While the cheesy mushroom patties are cooking, roughly chop your dill</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo, chopped dill, ketchup and your Dijon mustard in a small bowl – this is your burger sauce

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1  outer leaf[ves] for per person and set aside, then cut the remaining lettuce into wedges

Drain the quick-pickled shallots</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warm brioche halves with the lettuce leaves, cheesy mushroom patties, burger sauce and quick-pickled shallots

Serve the chips, lettuce wedges and any remaining burger sauce to the side

Drizzle the lettuce wedges with olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
