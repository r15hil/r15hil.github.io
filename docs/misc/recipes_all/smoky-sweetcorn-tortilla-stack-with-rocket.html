<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Preheat the grill to medium-high

Drain the sweetcorn

Once hot, add the drained sweetcorn to the pan and cook for 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the tortillas to a large baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? You might need to do this in batches!

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and spread over both sides of the tortillas

Put the tray under the grill for 3-4 min, turning the tortillas once halfway so they brown evenly on both sides</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the tortillas are cooking, chop the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> roughly

Add the chopped pepper to the pan with the sweetcorn and cook for 1 min

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomatoes, drained cannellini beans and half of the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan

Cook for 3-4 min or until the pepper has softened – this is your sweetcorn mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate the cheddar cheese

Combine the remaining smoked paprika with the mayo and half of the white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your smoky mayo

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread some of the sweetcorn mixture, grated cheese and a small handful of rocket (save some for garnish!) on the first tortilla of each stack

Layer on the second tortilla and repeat

Top with the final tortilla

Repeat this process for the other smoky sweetcorn tortilla stack<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky sweetcorn tortilla stacks with the remaining rocket to the side

Drizzle the smoky mayo over the top of the smoky sweetcorn tortilla stacks

Pour the remaining white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil over the rocket

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
