<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Add the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Remove the seeds!) to a small bowl with half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a small pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Mix everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While everything's in the oven, combine the tomato ketchup with all the<span class="text-danger"> </span>cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the honey, half the smoked paprika and half the tomato paste (save the rest for later!)

Add the remaining cider vinegar with the smoked sea salt flakes and give everything a good mix up – this is your Kansas-style sauce

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the cannellini beans

After an initial 20 min, remove the ribs from the oven and pour over half of the Kansas-style sauce (save the rest for later!), spreading the sauce out evenly with the back of a spoon (or cooking brush!)

Return the ribs to the oven for a final 6-7 min until sticky – these are your Kansas-style ribs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a little drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with the remaining smoked paprika and remaining tomato paste and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the quick-pickled chilli and reserve the pickling liquid

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water to the pot with the chicken stock mix, the pickling liquid from the green chillies and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – these are your spicy BBQ beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Loosen the remaining Kansas-style sauce with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Serve the Kansas-style ribs with the spicy BBQ beans, wedges and mayo to the side

Sprinkle the quick-pickled green chilli over the wedges and add the Kansas-style sauce to a little pot

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
