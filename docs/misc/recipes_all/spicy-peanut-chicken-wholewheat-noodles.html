<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly and trim, then chop your green beans in half

Once the pan is hot, add your diced chicken thigh and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 7-9 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken cooks, add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Once done, drain the soaked noodles and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the halved green beans and cook for a further 3 min or until starting to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
