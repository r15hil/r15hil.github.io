<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds and finely dice the remaining chilli[es]

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Combine the juice of half the lime and 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar with the chilli rounds and sliced shallot – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your crab meat with the diced cucumber, chopped tomato and chopped coriander

Add your mayo with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your crab aguachile</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, add the sliced ciabatta to the tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 8-10 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is ready, top the toasted ciabatta with the crab aguachile – these are your crab aguachile-style toasts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crab aguachile-style toasts garnished with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Serve the roast potatoes to the side topped with the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
