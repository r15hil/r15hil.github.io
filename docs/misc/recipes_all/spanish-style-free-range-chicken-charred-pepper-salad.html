<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano all over, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli</p><br><br>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – this is your charred pepper</p><br><br>
