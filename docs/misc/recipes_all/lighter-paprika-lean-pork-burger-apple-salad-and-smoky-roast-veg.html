<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] roughly

Add your butternut squash cubes and chopped carrot to a baking paper-lined baking tray, drizzle with a little vegetable oil then season with half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt, mix everything up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until they're crispy – this is your smoky roast veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Combine your lean pork mince and the remaining smoked paprika in a bowl with half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) and your ground coriander

Season very generously with salt and pepper

Divide and shape the mince into patties for 1 per person – these are your paprika lean pork burgers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your red onion[s], then slice into thin rings

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has started to caramelised

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar and natural yoghurt in a bowl with the remaining sliced spring onion and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing

Slice your apple[s] (skin on) thinly

Add the sliced apple to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the paprika lean pork burgers, press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the paprika lean pork burgers and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and give everything a good mix up – this is your apple salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your bread roll[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and toasted

Carefully slice them in half before serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, sandwich a paprika lean pork burger, some caramelised onion rings and a little apple salad between the toasted bread roll halves

Serve the smoky roast veg and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
