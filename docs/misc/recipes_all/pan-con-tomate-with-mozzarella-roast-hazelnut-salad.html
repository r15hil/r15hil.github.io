<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the ciabatta triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 7-10 min or until the ciabatta is starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your tomatoes in half

Grate the sliced tomatoes, on the sliced-side, into a shallow bowl until you are left with just the skin – this is your tomato pulp

Tip: Keep your palm flat while grating!

Discard the tomato skin

Set a fine sieve over a large bowl and drain the tomato pulp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the drained tomato pulp to the shallow bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your tomate topping

Set aside the bowl with the tomato juice for later

Once the ciabatta is starting to brown, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped hazelnuts to the side, then return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!) – this is your toasted ciabatta and toasted hazelnuts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred and wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain and pat your mozzarella dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!), then tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the ciabatta and hazelnuts are toasted, set them aside to cool slightly

Add your white wine vinegar and a generous drizzle of olive oil to the large bowl with the tomato juice

Add your honey and Dijon mustard with a pinch of salt, then whisk together – this is your tomato vinaigrette

Add the courgette ribbons, shredded lettuce and salad to the vinaigrette and toss – this is your tomato vinaigrette salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the ciabatta is slightly cooled, rub the sliced-side of the chopped garlic over it (not a fan of raw garlic? Only use a little!)

Spoon on the tomate topping – this is your pan con tomate</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato vinaigrette salad

Top with the torn mozzarella, pan con tomate and toasted hazelnuts
