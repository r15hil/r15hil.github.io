<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine your curry powder, half of your natural yoghurt, half of your ginger paste (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your tandoori marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken thigh to the tandoori marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is marinating, grate your beetroot then add to a sieve over the sink and squeeze out any excess water

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the marinated chicken to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to char – this is your tandoori chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add the grated beetroot and carrot to a large bowl with the sliced shallot, sultanas, cider vinegar, the remaining ginger paste, half of the chopped mint (save the rest for garnish!), 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your beetroot & carrot slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is nearly cooked, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium-high heat

Sprinkle your roti with a little cold water

Once hot, add the roti to the pan and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until warmed through

Tip: You may need to do this in batches or use a second pan</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the mango yoghurt over each warmed roti then top with some beetroot & carrot slaw and tandoori chicken

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint

Serve the remaining beetroot & carrot slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
