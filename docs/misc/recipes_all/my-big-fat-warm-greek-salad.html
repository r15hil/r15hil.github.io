<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the black&nbsp;olives and capers together roughly and add them to a large mixing bowl


Add the red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar - this is your Greek&nbsp;dressing&nbsp;


Pick the dill leaves from their stalks and tear them apart&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Break the crispy&nbsp;tortilla shards up into rough uneven pieces&nbsp;


Remove the warmed feta and tomato wedges from the oven and leave the feta to cool for 3-4 min (this stops it falling apart)


Add the cooked courgette,&nbsp;onion, tortilla shards,&nbsp;tomato wedges and dill leaves&nbsp; to the Greek&nbsp;dressing and give everything a good mix - this is your warm Greek salad


&nbsp;


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked feta over the warm Greek salad&nbsp;


Garnish with the&nbsp;sumac


Enjoy!&nbsp;</p><br><br>
