<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking paper-lined tray (or two) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 22-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>
