Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped courgette

Give everything a good mix up, then return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 15-20 min further or until the potatoes and courgette are crisp and golden – these are your smokey potatoes & courgette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Grind half your red wine vinegar, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, diced shallot, chopped parsley, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a pestle & mortar – this is your chimichurri

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor!

Combine the courgette ribbons and the chimichurri in a large bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your chimichurri courgette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 leaf per person and set aside

Chop the inner core into quarters, lengthways

Combine your mayo and remaining chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a small splash of water – this is your garlic sauce

Slice your halloumi in half, lengthways (like you're slicing a burger bun!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are nearly ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the halloumi is browned

<span class="text-danger">Ordered extra halloumi? Slice and cook in a pan with a little oil for 4-6 min or until golden all over</span>

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, top your toasted ciabatta base with a reserved lettuce leaf, the chimichurri courgette, the browned halloumi and the toasted ciabatta lid – this is your chimichurri courgette & halloumi sandwich

Serve the lettuce wedges to the side with a small drizzle of olive oil and the remaining red wine vinegar

Serve the smokey potatoes & courgette to the side, then drizzle over the garlic sauce and enjoy!</p><br><br>
