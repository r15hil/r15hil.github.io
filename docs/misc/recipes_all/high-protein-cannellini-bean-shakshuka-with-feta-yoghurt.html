<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion petals and pepper strips with a pinch of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pepper and onion have softened, add the chopped garlic to the pan with your ground smoked paprika and drained cannellini beans and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and vegetable stock with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5-6 min or until the vegetables are tender and the stock has thickened to a stew-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crumble your feta into small bite-sized pieces

Add the crumbled feta to a bowl with your natural yoghurt and a grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your feta yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once thickened, make 1 well per person in the pan, then crack your egg[s] into the well[s] and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your cannellini bean shakshuka

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, slice the toasted ciabatta halves on the diagonal</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cannellini bean shakshuka with the feta yoghurt and toasted ciabatta[s] to the side

Garnish with your pumpkin seeds, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
