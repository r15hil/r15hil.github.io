<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked tortiglioni, reserving a large cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned on both sides and almost cooked through

Once browned, transfer to a plate and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your chives finely

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your – this is your vegetable stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min further

Add your Chinese rice wine and vegetable stock to the pan and stir until the sauce begins to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove and discard the skin from the salmon

Flake the salmon into the pan, then cook for 3-4 min or until the salmon is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked through when it's opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the salmon is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and add the drained tortiglioni with your crème fraîche, wilted spinach and the juice of half your lemon[s]

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper, then give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce – this is your creamy salmon & spinach tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it’s looking a little dry!

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy salmon & spinach tortiglioni

Garnish with the chopped chives and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
