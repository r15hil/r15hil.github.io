<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato slices and courgette rounds to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the vegetables are golden and crisp – this is your cooked veg

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your spelt to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 20 min or until tender (it will still have a slight bite when cooked)

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and tomato paste to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes and most of your vegetable stock mix (save the rest for later!) to the pan with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your ragout sauce

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Once the vegetables are ready, add the cooked veg (careful, they will be hot!) to the ragout sauce and mix it all together until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fully coated, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your crème fraîche and most of the chopped dill (save some for garnish!) – this is your veggie ragout

Once the spelt is cooked, add the remaining vegetable stock mix and chopped spinach to the pot with the cooked spelt and mix it all together – this is your spinach spelt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the veggie ragout with the spinach spelt

Crumble over your feta and garnish with the reserved dill

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
