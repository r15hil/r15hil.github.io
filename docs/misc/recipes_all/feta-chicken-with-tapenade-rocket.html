<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle&nbsp;


Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, but don't cut all the way through (think of the piece as an open book)


Lay a sheet of cling film or greaseproof paper over the opened&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and bash the&nbsp;chicken with a rolling pin to an even thickness throughout&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Crumble up the feta


Arrange the crumbled&nbsp;feta over one side of the open&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and fold the other side over as though you're closing the book


Secure&nbsp;the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> together by threading the skewer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> through the opening (think sewing!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a lid with a drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil over a high heat


Add the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until browned&nbsp;


Add 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span>&nbsp;water to the&nbsp;pan


Cover with a lid and cook for 12-16 min or until the chicken is cooked and the juices run clear


Once cooked, transfer to a chopping board to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces


Add the potatoes to a pot with a generous pinch of salt


Cover the potatoes&nbsp;with boiled water and cook over a medium heat for 10-15 min or until tender&nbsp;


Once cooked, drain and leave&nbsp;to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the olives finely


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic&nbsp;


Add the chopped&nbsp;olives, chopped&nbsp;garlic, dried oregano&nbsp;and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;to a pestle and mortar


Grind to a coarse paste - this is your tapenade&nbsp;

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pot to a high heat with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of olive oil&nbsp;


Once the butter has melted, add the potatoes, spring onion and a generous pinch of both&nbsp;salt and pepper


Lightly crush the potatoes with a masher and set them aside


Wash, dry, then dress&nbsp;the rocket leaves with a splash of olive oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken with the crushed potatoes, salad and tapenade to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
