<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper to one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Add the chips to the other side of the tray[s]

Drizzle everything with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then give it a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the pepper is tender and slightly charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine your mayo and chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) in a bowl with the chopped dill, a pinch of salt and 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> [1 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your herby aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your balsamic vinegar to a bowl

Once the pepper is tender, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Transfer the tender pepper to the bowl and set aside to marinate

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 10-15 min further, or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut in half widthways

Add your cornflour, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your cornflour mix

Add the hake pieces to the plate and press them into the cornflour mix until completely coated – this is your coated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through and lightly crisped – this is your crispy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are almost done, add your ciabatta[s] to the tray[s] and return it to the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove the marinated pepper from the bowl and reserve the balsamic vinegar

Once done, carefully slice the warmed ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your sandwich, spread a little herby aioli over each ciabatta base and top with the marinated pepper and the crispy hake, then finish with the ciabatta lid

Serve the salad, chips and remaining herby aioli to the side

Drizzle the salad with some of the reserved balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
