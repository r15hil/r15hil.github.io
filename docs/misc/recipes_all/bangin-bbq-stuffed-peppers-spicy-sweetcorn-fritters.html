Drain and rinse your black beans

Combine the drained black beans with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – these are your BBQ black beans

Cut your sweet pointed pepper[s] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)</p><br><br>

<p>Transfer the pepper halves to an oven-proof dish and load them up with the BBQ black beans

Drizzle the peppers with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the peppers are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweetcorn fritters with the BBQ stuffed peppers to the side and a dollop of herby mayo
