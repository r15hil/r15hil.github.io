<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the cubed potatoes with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are browning, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your tomato[es] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are lightly browned, add the chopped garlic and ginger to the pan with the chopped tomato and your curry powder

Give everything a good mix and cook for 3-4 min or until the garlic has softened and the tomato has begun to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and your vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[590ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

Once the tomato has begun to break down, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook, covered, for an initial 8-10 min or until the potatoes are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board

Slice through the thickest part of the chicken breast being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side and open it out like a book

Cover with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until you have an even thickness – this is your butterflied chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Season the butterflied chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and coat in your ground turmeric

Add the seasoned chicken to a baking paper-lined tray and sprinkle your nigella seeds over the top

Drizzle over a little olive oil and put the nigella chicken in the oven for an initial 10-12 min or until golden

Wash your spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, add the chopped green beans and spinach to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook, covered, for a final 10-12 min or until the beans are tender with a slight bite – this is your potato & green bean curry

After the chicken has had an initial 10-12 min, remove the tray from the oven and drizzle your honey over the top

Return the honey nigella chicken to the oven for a final 5 min or until glazed and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the potato & green bean curry with the honey nigella chicken to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
