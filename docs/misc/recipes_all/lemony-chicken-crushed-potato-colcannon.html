<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 15-17 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot (you want them to be crumbly!)

Once done, drain and set aside, reserve the pot for later

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water to the pan with the chicken stock mix

Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and chop into small pieces

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add a large knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion and spring greens with a splash of water and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Once the spring greens are tender, add the cooked potatoes and a large splash of milk to the pot

Season with a pinch of salt and crush the potatoes gently with a potato masher – this is your crushed potato colcannon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-7-copy-1614618752420-x200.jpg' alt='Step 7 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the soft cheese, chopped basil (reserve a little for garnish!) and the juice from 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony basil sauce

Slice the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crushed potato colcannon with the sliced chicken and lemony basil sauce to the side

Finish with a grind of black pepper and a lemon wedge

Garnish with the remaining basil

Bosh!</p><br><br>
