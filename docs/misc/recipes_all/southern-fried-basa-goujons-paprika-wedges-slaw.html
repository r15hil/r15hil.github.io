<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your paprika wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the wedges are cooking, chop your basa fillet[s] lengthways into finger-width strips

Pat dry with kitchen paper – these are your basa goujons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to a bowl with your vegetable stock mix, dried oregano, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining ground smoked paprika

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your spiced cornflour</p><br><br>

Give everything a good mix up until the basa goujons are fully coated, then set aside – these are your coated basa goujons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a large bowl with your mayo and the sliced spring onions and mix it all together – this is your creamy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the wedges are almost ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa goujons and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your southern fried basa goujons

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the southern fried basa goujons with the paprika wedges, creamy slaw and a dollop of ketchup to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
