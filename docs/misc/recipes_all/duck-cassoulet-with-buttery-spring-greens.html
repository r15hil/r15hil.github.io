<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> duck fat over a medium-high heat

Tip: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil!

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once beginning to soften, add the sliced garlic, diced potato and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the dish and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained cannellini beans, tomato paste, bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>, dried thyme and duck jelly

Add the red wine paste, chicken stock mix and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat and top with the duck legs

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven and cook, uncovered, for an initial 25 min

Meanwhile, combine the panko breadcrumbs, grated Italian hard cheese, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to a large piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the spring greens to form a tightly sealed parcel, add to a baking tray and set aside (this will go in the oven later!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Make 2 separate parcels!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 25 min, remove the dish from the oven and top with the cheesy breadcrumbs

Return the dish to the oven, along with the spring green parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cook both for a final 10-12 min or until the duck is golden and crisp and the spring greens are tender – this is your duck cassoulet & buttery spring greens

Discard the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the duck cassoulet with the buttery spring greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
