<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, bash your lemongrass<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and discard, then chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Chop half your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly, and finely slice the rest into rounds (save these for garnish!)

Put everything into a food processor (can't handle the heat? Go easy on the chilli!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your flaked almonds and half your ground turmeric (you’ll use the rest later!) to the food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil

Add your soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of sugar

Pulse until you're left with a slightly chunky paste – this is your Malaysian-style spice paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle, then heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n to the pan and sprinkle over the remaining ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the Malaysian-style spice paste to the meat-free chick'n and cook for 2-3<span class="text-danger"> </span>min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tamarind paste with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 2-3 min

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then add it to the pan and cook for 1 min further – this is your Malaysian-style coconut meat-free chick'n</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Malaysian-style coconut meat-free chick'n with the basmati rice and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
