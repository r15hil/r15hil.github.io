<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat and boil a kettle

Once hot, add your toasted sesame seeds, cumin seeds, dried oregano and ground sumac with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, transfer to a pestle & mortar, reserve the pan – this is your toasted mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender and once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk, season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth (this can be quickly reheated before serving!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop your garlic and your brown onion[s]

Combine half the chopped garlic, half your baharat and 1/3 of the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!) in a medium bowl with your lean beef mince and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!), then divide and shape them into 3 meatballs per person – these are your baharat meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the baharat meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and reboil half a kettle

Dice your tomato[es] roughly

Grind the toasted mixture coarsely in the pestle & mortar – this is your za'atar</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot, add the remaining diced onion, chopped garlic and diced tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until the tomato has softened

Add your tomato paste, remaining baharat and half the za'atar (save the rest for later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your beef stock mix with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until slightly thickened

Once the sauce has slightly thickened, return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered for 12-15 min or until cooked through

While the sauce is thickening, trim your green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water, the remaining za'atar and and a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the green beans to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the green beans are tender with a slight bite – this is your za'atar green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baharat meatballs over the mash with the za'atar green beans to the side

Drizzle any remaining za'atar butter from the beans over the mash

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
