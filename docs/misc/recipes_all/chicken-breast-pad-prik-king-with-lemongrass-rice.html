<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger, shallot[s] and garlic, then roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the softer inner core[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot, garlic, ginger, chopped lemongrass and coriander to a food processor with your ground paprika, cracked black pepper, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1.5 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp] </span>sugar and blitz to a paste – this is your fiery curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice to a pot with a lid with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and the outer lemongrass layers<span class="text-danger"> </span>and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and stir vigorously for 1 min, then cover and cook for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and discard the outer lemongrass layers and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 4-5 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is browned, add the halved green beans and onion petals and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the veg has started to soften and the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
