<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min, or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once the chicken is golden, add a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your cooked chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until slightly darkened in colour

Tip: Watch these like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, remove the tray from the oven and set aside to cool – these are your toasted nuts & seeds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your soy sauce, chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> brown sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Add the juice of your lime[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>straight into the bowl and whisk it all together – this is your chilli lime dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your black beans

Once the rice is tender, add the drained black beans to the pot and cook for a further 4 min

Drain the brown rice and black beans and allow to steam-dry for 1-2 min or until cooled slightly, before returning them both to the pot – this is your beany rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop the cooled toasted nuts & seeds together coarsely (save a few whole cashew nuts for garnish!) – this is your toasted nut & seed mix

Add half of the chilli lime dressing, most of the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) and the toasted nut & seed mix to the beany rice and mix together gently – this is your chilli lime bean & rice salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the cooked chicken on a clean board

Serve the sliced chicken over the chilli lime bean & rice salad

Garnish with the reserved cashew nuts, remaining chopped coriander and spoon over the remaining chilli lime dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
