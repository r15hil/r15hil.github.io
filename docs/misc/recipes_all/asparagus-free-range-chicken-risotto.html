<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add the asparagus tips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until bright green and tender with a bite – these are your roasted asparagus tips

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped asparagus stalks and cook for 5 min further until the rice is cooked and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] and the grated cheese and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your asparagus & chicken risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the asparagus & free range chicken risotto topped with the roasted asparagus tips and a handful of salad

Drizzle with some olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
