<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a large baking tray

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Chop your hake fillet[s] in half widthways

Coat the chopped hake evenly in your red Thai curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to a plate with a pinch of salt

Press the chopped hake into the flour firmly to evenly coat all over

Meanwhile, peel and dice half your shallot[s]

Finely slice the remaining shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the diced shallot to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your quick-pickled shallot

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced shallot and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy – this is your crispy shallot

Once crispy, transfer them to a small bowl or plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrots and roughly chop your roasted peanuts

Add the grated carrot, chopped coriander and chopped roasted peanuts to the quick-pickled shallot and mix to combine – this is your quick-pickled Asian-style slaw

Combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche bun halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until coloured and charred on one side only

Once charred, remove and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated hake, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 2 min on each side or until cooked through and lightly crisp – this is your Thai-style hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, add a little sriracha mayo to each charred brioche bun base and top with the Thai-style hake, crispy shallot, some of the quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and a charred brioche bun lid

Serve with the crispy fries, the remaining quick-pickled Asian-style slaw and sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
