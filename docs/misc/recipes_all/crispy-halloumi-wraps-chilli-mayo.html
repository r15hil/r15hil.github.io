<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Grate the cheddar cheese

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your halloumi into strips (3 per person!)

Coat the halloumi strips in the spice mix (make sure to tap off any excess!)

Add the coated halloumi strips to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded halloumi strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the halloumi strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy halloumi strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
