<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your pak choi and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop the base off the pak choi and discard, then slice in half lengthways

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, add the chopped garlic and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your honey and half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and cook for 4-5 min or until the beef becomes crispy, sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chilli beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the beef is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix, sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining soy sauce in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[800ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water – this is your spicy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved pak choi and spicy stock and cook for 2-3 min until the pak choi has started to soften

Stir through your udon noodles and cook for 1 min further – this is your udon broth

Tip: You may need to gently break apart the noodles with a fork!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel lengths from your carrot[s] until you have a pile of carrot ribbons

Trim and finely slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the udon broth topped with the crispy chilli beef, carrot ribbons and sliced spring onion

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds and remaining chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
