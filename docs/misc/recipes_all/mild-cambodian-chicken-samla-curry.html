<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, slice down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (keep them for later!) and chop the softer inner stem[s] finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water, the outer lemongrass layers and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your lemongrass rice

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and add your lime leaves, fish sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once fragrant, add the sliced pepper, chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chopped lemongrass inner stem and cook for 4-5 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the coconut stock, halved green beans and a pinch of salt and cook for 7-9 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your mild Cambodian-style chicken samla curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your roasted peanuts roughly

Remove the lemongrass outer layers from the rice and discard</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mild Cambodian-style chicken samla curry with the lemongrass rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the chopped peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
