<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic, ground cumin, ground turmeric and half of your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the pepper strips to one side of a baking tray (or two!)

Add your butternut squash cubes to the other side of the tray[s] with the remaining ground smoked paprika

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water and stir in your saffron (not a fan of saffron? Just add a little!) – this is your saffron stock

Add your white long grain rice to the pan with a pinch of salt and stir everything together

Add the saffron stock and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry and the rice isn't cooked yet!

Whilst the rice is cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked pepper to a clean chopping board and chop it finely (be careful, it will be hot!)

Add the chopped pepper and mint to a bowl with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar, a pinch of salt and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your pepper salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add your blanched peas to the pan with the roasted squash and cook, covered, for 2 min further or until everything's warmed through

Fluff the rice with a fork and add the chopped parsley – this is your smoky roasted veg rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky roasted veg rice topped with the pepper salsa

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
