Once the onion and garlic has slightly softened, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have completely softened

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the gnocchi and trimmed asparagus tips to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi and asparagus for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot and once done, drain both, reserving a cup of the starchy cooking water

Add the cooked gnocchi and asparagus tips to the sauce and mix it all together, add a little starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry – this is your asparagus & tomato gnocchi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the asparagus & tomato gnocchi in bowls topped with the crispy capers

Drizzle over a little olive oil and enjoy!</p><br><br>
