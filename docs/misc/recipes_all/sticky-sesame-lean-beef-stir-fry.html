<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the lean beef has browned, add your cornflour, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and maple syrup, then return the softened pepper to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until sticky and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
