<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop half your chestnut mushrooms finely, then peel and finely dice half your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(you'll use the rest for later!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped mushrooms and diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the remaining onion and remaining chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the mushroom and onion has softened, add them to a bowl (reserve the pan) with half your smoked paprika (save the rest for later!), your meat-free burger patties and your panko breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your meat-free stroganoff mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Divide the meat-free stroganoff mixture<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape into 4 meatballs per person

Add the meat-free stroganoff meatballs to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put it in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with the sliced onion and sliced mushroom and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until slightly softened

Whilst softening, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add the remaining smoked paprika and half your chopped garlic (you'll use the rest for later!) with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> [2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix, soy sauce and creamy single soy and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened

Once thickened, stir through the chopped parsley – this is your stroganoff sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 25-30 min, remove the tray from the oven and stir through your crispy onions and remaining chopped garlic

Return the tray to the oven for a further 2-3 min – these are your garlic roast potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free stroganoff meatballs with the garlic roast potatoes to the side and spoon over the stroganoff sauce

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
