<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato discs to a baking tray (or two!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Sprinkle with cold water (this will help the potatoes cook through!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Grate your chestnut mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Once the onion and tomato have began to soften, add the grated mushrooms, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt to the pan

Increase the heat to high and cook for 4-6 min further or until softened

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, add your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste to the pan with your soy sauce and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water

Season with a generous grind of black pepper, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened – this is your mushroom bolognese sauce

Combine your double cream with the remaining garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic cream</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the mushroom bolognese sauce to a oven-proof dish (or use individual ones for fancy presentation) and top with layers of the cooked potatoes

Pour the garlic cream all over and sprinkle with the grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your mushroom bolognese x dauphinoise potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and your balsamic vinegar – this is your dressed salad

Serve the mushroom bolognese x dauphinoise potatoes with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
