<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Pat the free range chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt, add them to a baking tray and drizzle with vegetable oil (use tin foil to avoid mess!), then put the tray in the oven and cook for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until tender, then drain

Once drained, toss the noodles in your toasted sesame oil, then add them to the pan and give everything a good mix up – these are your Singapore-style noodles</p><br><br>
