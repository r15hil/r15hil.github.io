<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Roughly chop your roasted peanuts and trim, then slice your spring onion[s], then add the chopped peanuts with half the sliced spring onion, half your toasted sesame oil (save the rest for later!) and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your crunchy chilli oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and carrot discs with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pepper with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water and your chicken stock mix

Add the remaining toasted sesame oil with your soy sauce and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix it all together

Cook for 6-7 min or until the chicken has cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your golden crown chicken curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the golden crown chicken curry with the cooked rice to the side

Top with the crunchy chilli oil and reserved sliced spring onion
