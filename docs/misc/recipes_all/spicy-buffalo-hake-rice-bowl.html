<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[450ml] </span>cold water, your ground coriander and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour, ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a plate and mix it all together

Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Press the hake fillet[s] firmly into the seasoned flour, coating evenly on both sides – this your coated hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your crispy hake fillet

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g] </span><span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter to a microwave-safe jug with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your buffalo sauce mix

Put the buffalo sauce mix in the microwave for 1 min or until the butter has melted, then mix until fully combined

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your buffalo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your mayo to a small bowl with the grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), remaining cider vinegar, dried oregano, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained sweetcorn to the cooked rice with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix it all together – this is your spiced corn rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy hake fillet over the spiced corn rice with the shredded lettuce to the side

Add a small drizzle of olive oil to the shredded lettuce

Top with the buffalo sauce and ranch-style mayo and garnish with the crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
