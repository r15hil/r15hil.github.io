<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Trim the green stalks off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Then top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped aubergine, courgette and pepper to a baking tray (or two!) with a very generous drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle over your dried oregano, give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While your veg is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1.05L] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-5-copy-1641309662557-x200.jpg' alt='Step 5 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and your arborio rice to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for a further 30 secs or until evaporated

Once evaporated, add the vegetable stock mix a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your tomato stock

Once the vegetables have had 20 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the halved cherry tomatoes and tomato stock

Mix it all together and return the tray to the oven for a further 5-8 min – this is your ratatouille</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar flavour block[s]

Once the rice is cooked, add a knob of butter alternative and half the grated cheddar flavour block[s] (save the rest for garnish!) and gently stir it all together – this is your cheezy risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the ratatouille over the cheezy risotto

Top with the chopped basil and remaining grated cheddar flavour block

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
