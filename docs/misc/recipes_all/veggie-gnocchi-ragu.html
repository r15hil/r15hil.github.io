<p><strong>Description:</strong> Our Gnocchi Ragu is made with soy mince, which creates a quick, simple and flavourful veggie Bolognese alternative for meat-free feasting. By roasting the broccoli, you intensify the flavour without losing any of the nutrients in boiling. You can also cook the gnocchi on the same tray - use two if you canâ€™t fit it all on!</p>
