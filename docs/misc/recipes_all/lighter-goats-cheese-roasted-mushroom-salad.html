<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Dice your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped garlic in a bowl with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your garlic butter

Spread the garlic butter evenly over your portobello mushroom[s] and add to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the diced potato and pepper wedges to the other side of the baking paper-lined baking tray[s]

Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with your dried oregano and a generous pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is cooked through and tender – these are your roasted pepper & potatoes and garlic portobello mushroom</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based dry pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, transfer the toasted pumpkin seeds to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 8-10 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad and lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Roughly shred the lettuce

Combine half your balsamic vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) and pomegranate molasses in a large bowl, with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Add the salad and shredded lettuce to the bowl and toss – these are your dressed leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onions are softened, add the remaining balsamic vinegar and 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 1/2 tsp] </span>sugar to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until sticky and caramelised – these are your caramelised onions</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the dressed leaves at the bottom of the plate and layer over the roasted pepper & potatoes

Top with the caramelised onions and garlic portobello mushroom

Crumble over your goats' cheese

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
