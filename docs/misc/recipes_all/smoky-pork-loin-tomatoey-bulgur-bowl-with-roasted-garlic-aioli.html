<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and slice your red onion[s] into thin wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Season both sides with salt and sprinkle with half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your coated steak[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated steak[s] and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!

Once cooked, transfer the cooked steak[s] to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the steak[s] are cooking, heat a pot with a lid with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and onion wedges with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for an initial 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once starting to brown, add your tomato paste to the pot with the remaining ground smoked paprika and half your roasted garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!)

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

Add 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the bulgur wheat has cooked – this is your tomatoey bulgur</p><br><br>
