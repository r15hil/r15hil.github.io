<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Cut the paneer into cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the paneer with the ginger & garlic paste and soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the paneer is golden, add the chopped spring onion to the pan and cook for a further 2-3 min or until softened

When the noodles are almost cooked, add the sliced pepper to the noodles and cook for 1-2 min further

Once done, drain the noodles and red pepper and reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water</p><br><br>
