<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your ground paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your paprika fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a bowl with your ground cumin, garam masala and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once browned, transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mango chutney and half of your mayo (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your mango mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the fries have been in the oven for an initial 20 min, move them to one side of the tray[s] and add your ciabatta[s] to the other side

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the ciabatta is hot and toasted

Carefully slice the toasted ciabatta in half before serving</p><br><br>

<p>Add your white wine vinegar to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp]</span> sugar<span class="text-danger"> </span>and mix until dissolved

Stir in your curry powder and remaining mayo

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your curried slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top your toasted ciabatta base with a dollop of mango mayo, the spiced chicken, a handful of curried slaw and the toasted ciabatta lid – this is your Indian-style chicken breast burger

Serve the paprika fries and remaining curried slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
