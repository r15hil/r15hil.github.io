<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Toss the salad in the balsamic dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pepperoni pizza-style open sandwiches with the chips and salad to the side

Season with a pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
