<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the ground turmeric, smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the curry powder, half the Greek-style yogurt (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper to a large bowl and stir it all together – this is your tandoori marinade

Add the chicken thighs to the tandoori marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the potato cubes to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Sprinkle the remaining curry powder over the potato cubes, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and drizzle with vegetable oil – these are your spiced roast potatoes

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While everything is in the oven, grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Combine the cranberry sauce, tamarind paste and grated carrot in a bowl – this is your tamarind & cranberry slaw

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of parsnip ribbons

Once the tandoori chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean chopping board and reserve the tray

Add the parsnip ribbons to the reserved tray and return it to the oven for 5 min further or until both the potatoes and parsnips are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Shred the tandoori chicken apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Spread the remaining Greek-style yoghurt over 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> naan<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then top with the tamarind & cranberry slaw and the pulled tandoori chicken

Sprinkle over the chopped coriander then top with the remaining naan<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your Indian chicken Christmas naanwiches</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, cut each Indian chicken Christmas naanwich into 4<span class="text-danger"> </span>and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and crispy parsnip ribbons

Serve with the spiced roast potatoes to the side
