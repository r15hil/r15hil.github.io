<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your 'Nduja (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and cook for 6-8 min or until crisp and golden – this is your crispy 'Nduja</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your portobello mushroom tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked portobello mushroom tortelloni in a colander, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water (save the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped parsley and lemon zest in a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your gremolata

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy tomato stock to the pot and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken – this is your creamy tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained portobello mushroom tortelloni to the creamy tomato sauce and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato portobello mushroom tortelloni with the salad to the side

Top the tortelloni with the crispy 'Nduja (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and gremolata

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
