<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use two trays!

Add the dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breast portions to a seperate tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, shred the cooked chicken into rough, bite-sized pieces using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped garlic to a small bowl with the pesto and a drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – this is your pesto sauce

Drain the mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can!)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the pizza base mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press each dough ball in the centre and push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is slightly smaller than a side plate (you will make them bigger in the pan!) – these are your pizza bases

Heat 1<span class="text-danger"> [2] </span>large, dry, wide-based pans (preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, carefully add a pizza base to the pan<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, pushing the dough out to the edge to help shape the crust

Tip: To pick up the pizza dough, gently flip it over the back of your hand to stop it ripping!

Add 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1/4]</span> of the pesto sauce to each pizza base and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon (be careful of the hot pan!)

Cook the pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> for 3-4 min or until the crust has started to puff up, then remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and slide the puffed pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>onto the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Repeat this process for the next pizza base<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Tip: Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!

Top them with the torn mozzarella, pulled chicken and basil leaves

Drizzle the crusts with olive oil then put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the rocket to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, the balsamic vinegar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your rocket salad

Serve the pizzas with the rocket salad on top or to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
