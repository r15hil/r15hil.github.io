<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once browned, add your ground cumin with a couple of splashes of cold water to the pan and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks (reserve the pan) – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced red onion and chopped garlic and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and garlic have softened, add your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste to the pan with your chicken stock mix and chipotle paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 5 min or until a thick sauce remains – this is your chipotle sauce

While the sauce is thickening, drain and rinse your black beans and sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer 1/3 of the chipotle sauce to a medium-sized pot – this is your enchilada topping

Add the drained black beans, drained sweetcorn and pulled chicken to the pan with the remaining chipotle sauce and give it a good mix up – this is your enchilada filling

Return the pot with the enchilada topping to a high heat for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Divide the enchilada filling between your tortillas

Roll up each tortilla tightly and place them in an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Top with the enchilada topping and tear your cheeze flavour slice[s] over the top 

Put the dish[es] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the tortillas are crispy and the cheeze has melted – these are your lighter cheezy chipotle free range chicken enchiladas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lighter cheezy chipotle free range chicken enchiladas

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
