<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the beef mince to a bowl with generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly with clean hands for 1 min until fully combined (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat

Add the beef patties and cook for 5-6 min on one side, or until browned

Once browned, flip the patties and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Cover loosely with a lid (or some tin foil!) and cook for 2-3 min further or until the cheese has melted and the patties are cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Drain the pickled shallots (discard the pickling liquid), then spread each brioche base with mayo and each brioche lid with chilli jam

To assemble, top the brioche base with the pickled shallots, some lettuce leaves, a cheesy patty, some peanut butter and a brioche lid

Serve with the smoky wedges to the side and enjoy!</p><br><br>
