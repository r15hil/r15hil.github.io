<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your hot dog sausage[s] and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once browned, transfer the sausage[s] to a clean chopping board (reserve the pan!)

Cut narrow slices widthways (about the width of a pound coin) into the hot dog sausage[s], making sure not to cut all the way down to the base

Add the sliced hot dog sausage[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until the sausage[s] is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
