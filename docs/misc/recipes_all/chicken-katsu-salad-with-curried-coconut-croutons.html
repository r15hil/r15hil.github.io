<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred, then slice your red chilli[es] finely, then combine the sliced red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span>[2 tsp] </span>sugar and half your rice vinegar (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped creamed coconut to a bowl with half your curry powder (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water and stir to combine – this is your marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Press the torn ciabatta into the marinade until all the sauce soaks into the bread – these are your coconut curried croutons

Add the coconut curried croutons to a baking paper-lined tray

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the croutons are crispy around the edges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining curry powder and ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer it to a bowl and reserve the pan

Add your mango chutney and soy sauce to the bowl with the remaining rice vinegar and mix it all together – this is your katsu dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with some cling film

Bash the chicken with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – this is your chicken escalope</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs and your ground turmeric to a plate and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your panko mix

Coat the chicken escalope in a drizzle of vegetable oil, then press into the panko mix firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your breaded chicken

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!

Drain the quick-pickled chilli, add the pickling liquid to the katsu dressing and stir it all together</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>On a clean board, slice the breaded chicken finely into strips

Serve your shredded lettuce, carrot & cabbage slaw mix and curried coconut croutons topped with the sliced breaded chicken and quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Drizzle the katsu dressing all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
