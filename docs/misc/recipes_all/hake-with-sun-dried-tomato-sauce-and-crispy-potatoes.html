<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with the crushed garlic and rosemary leaves

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, drizzle with vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the potatoes are beginning to soften

Meanwhile, boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, add the hake fillet[s] to the tray (Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!)

Return the tray to the oven for a further 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the potatoes are crisp

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the fish has been cooking for 5 min, trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot and cover until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the beans are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and tomato paste with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir in your soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min further – this is your sun-dried tomato sauce

Tip: Add a splash of water if the sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hake fillet over the sun-dried tomato sauce with the crispy potatoes, roasted garlic and green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
