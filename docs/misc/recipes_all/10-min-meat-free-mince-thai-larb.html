<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped spring onion and cook for 5-6 min or until browned

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the meat-free mince is cooking, cut your lime[s] in half

Roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Add your cooked white long grain rice and ginger & garlic paste to the browned meat-free mince and cook for 2-3 min, breaking the rice up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Roughly shred the inner cores</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your soy sauce, the juice of half the lime[s], sesame oil, shredded lettuce, sliced chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mint and coriander to the pan and give it a good mix up – this is your larb filling

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lettuce leaves on plates and load them up with the larb filling

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
