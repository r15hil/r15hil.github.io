<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, line a separate baking tray with tin foil

Add your meat-free patty[ies] to the tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and sliced pepper with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 10-12 min or until golden and softened – this is your caramelised onion & pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Melt 10g<span class="text-purple"> [15g] </span><span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> milk and a pinch of salt into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Remove the pot from the heat and stir through the grated cheddar and umami seasoning – this is your cheese sauce

Once the meat-free patty[ies] are cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and transfer the patty[ies] to a clean chopping board

Slice the meat-free patty[ies] into strips, then add them to the caramelised onion & pepper and mix it all together – this is your philly 'steak' filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut a slit into the top of each hot dog bun

Once the chips are nearly cooked, remove the tray from the oven and add the cut hot dog buns

Return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until the buns are warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each warmed hot dog bun with the philly 'steak' filling, then pour over the cheese sauce and drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Serve the chips to the side and top with any remaining philly 'steak' filling, remaining cheese sauce and the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
