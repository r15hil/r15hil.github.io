<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the crispy meat-free bacon to a bowl and return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine half of your cider vinegar (save the rest for later!) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your dressing

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the garlic is fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your creamy single soy, miso paste and remaining cider vinegar

Tip: The miso paste adds an umami flavour to the sauce!

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened to a creamy consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked spaghetti and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce – this is your plant-based spaghetti carbonara

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is a little thick!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based spaghetti carbonara and top with the crispy meat-free bacon and a grind of black pepper

Toss the salad and diced tomato, then serve to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
