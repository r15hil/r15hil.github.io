<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop your apple[s] into wedges and discard the core[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken breast to the dish with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour and cook for 30 secs

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped apple and onion wedges with the crushed garlic and give everything a good stir

Add your chicken stock mix and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[350ml] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your Chinese rice wine and stir through with your wholegrain mustard and soft cheese

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 25-30 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Normandy-style chicken breast & apple casserole

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the casserole is almost done, trim your green beans and add to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Add your ciabatta[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 7-9 min or until the green beans are tender but retaining a bite and the ciabatta is warm and crusty</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, chop your chives and sprinkle them all over the Normandy-style chicken breast & apple casserole then season with pepper

Serve the green beans and crusty ciabatta to the side

Tip: For extra indulgence spread the ciabatta with butter before dipping
