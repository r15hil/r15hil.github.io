<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add each coated basa strip to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through – these are your crispy fish strips

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and tamarind paste in a small bowl – this is your tamarind mayo

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, divide the tamarind mayo and quick-pickled salad between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with 2 crispy fish strips – these are your Vietnamese-style crispy fish tacos

Garnish with the reserved sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
