<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chicken breast portion to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate along with your ground paprika and a generous grind of pepper and mix it all together – this is your spice mix

Add a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and grate your cheddar cheese

Add your panko breadcrumbs to another plate with the grated cheese, lots of pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your halloumi in to 3 strips per person

Tip: First slice the halloumi in half lengthways and then slice each half into 3 strips

Coat the halloumi strips in the spice mix (make sure to tap off any excess!)

Add the coated halloumi strips to the milk and finally press them into the cheesy breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded halloumi strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil

Add the breaded halloumi strips to the tray and top them with any remaining cheesy breadcrumbs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-15 min or until golden – these are your crispy halloumi strips</p><br><br>

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the halloumi strips are almost done, add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min until warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the sliced tomato and shredded lettuce evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with a crispy halloumi strip and drizzle over the chilli mayo

Serve the cooked chicken to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
