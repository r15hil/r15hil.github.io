<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over high heat

Once hot, add the rainbow veg mix and cook for 3 min or until the veg has slightly softened but still has some crunch

Once the veg has slightly softened, add the ginger & garlic paste and the edamame & jasmine rice and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the honey, tamari, sriracha and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your spicy sauce

Once the chicken is golden, transfer it to the rice pan and add the spicy sauce (reserve the pan!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 3 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and everything is piping hot – this is your chicken nasi-goreng</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Shake your eggs before cracking for a perfectly-centred yolk</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken nasi-goreng topped with a fried egg and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
