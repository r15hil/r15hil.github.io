<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Cut the waxy potatoes (skins on) in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and leave them to steam dry (save the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, combine the baharat with a generous pinch of salt on a plate

Add the chicken thighs to the spices and turn them several times until they're fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken thighs skin-side down and cook for 5-7 min or until crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice into strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once done, add the crispy chicken thighs to a baking tray, skin-side up (save the pan!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baharat chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes, ground turmeric and coriander seeds and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the green beans to the reserved pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop the parsley and dill finely, including the stalks

Once the potatoes are beginning to crisp, add the chopped garlic, chilli strips (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped parsley and dill – this is your batata harra</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges and slice the baharat chicken

Serve the sliced baharat chicken with the batata harra, green beans and a dollop of natural yoghurt to the side

Sprinkle the natural yoghurt with some sumac and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
