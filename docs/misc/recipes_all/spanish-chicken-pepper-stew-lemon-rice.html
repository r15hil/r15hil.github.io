<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Sprinkle over your ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is in the oven, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of sugar and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has slightly softened

Once slightly softened, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until the cherry tomatoes begin to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Chop your black olives roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the stock, chopped pepper and chopped black olives to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

Meanwhile, combine the remaining garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), white wine vinegar and mayo in a bowl and mix everything together – this is your garlic aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Add the pulled chicken and oregano to the pan and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the chicken is warmed through

Season generously with black pepper – this is your Spanish-style chicken & pepper stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Spanish-style chicken & pepper stew over the cooked rice

Drizzle the garlic aioli all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
