<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain into a sieve and set aside (save the pot for later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Dice your cucumber

Add the diced cucumber and sliced radishes to a bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Tip: Not a fan of five spice? Just add half!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned prawns and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown slightly

Once browned add the soy and honey sauce to the pan and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the prawns are cooked through and a sticky sauce has formed, then remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat

Wash your shredded kale

Add the drained rice with the shredded kale and cook for 2 min or until the kale is mixed through and beginning to wilt

Remove from the heat and season with a pinch of salt – this is your brown rice & kale</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky king prawns over the brown rice & kale with the quick-pickled salad to the side

Sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
