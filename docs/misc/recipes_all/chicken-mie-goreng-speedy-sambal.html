<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air then boil a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Trim, then chop your red chilli[es] roughly

Tip: Deseed the chilli first if you're not a fan of spice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, garlic and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a food processor with your sriracha, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Blitz until smooth – this is your speedy sambal

Tip: If you don't have a food processor, use a pestle and mortar</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown slightly, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is almost cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then chop finely on a diagonal until you are left with carrot strips

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is almost cooked through, add the carrot strips and cook for 2 min

Add the chopped spring greens and cook for 1 min further, then add a very small splash of cold water and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Drain the cooked noodles and add them to the pan with the chicken and vegetables

Gently stir everything together for 1-2 min or until the noodles are fully coated in the sauce and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken mie goreng</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken mie goreng in a bowl

Garnish with your crispy onions and drizzle the remaining speedy sambal all over (not a fan of spice? Just drizzle a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
