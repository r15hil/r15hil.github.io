<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add them to a baking paper-lined baking tray with your curry powder, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until everything is golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, add to the pan and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, transfer the cooked steak[s] to a plate to rest and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once the onion has softened, add half the chopped garlic & ginger (you'll use the rest later!), crushed cardamom, cumin seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water and red wine vinegar

Stir it all together and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce begins to thicken to a gravy-like consistency – this is your vindaloo-style curry sauce

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens with the remaining chopped garlic & ginger and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite – these are your garlic & ginger greens</p><br><br>

<p>Once the the sauce has thickened, transfer the cooked pork loin steak[s] to the pan with any cooking juices and reduce the heat to very low until ready to serve – this is your Goan-style vindaloo pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Goan-style vindaloo pork with the curried potatoes and garlic & ginger greens to the side

Drizzle over any remaining Goan-style vindaloo curry sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
