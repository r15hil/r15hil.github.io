<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the chopped pepper to the pan[s]

Cook for a further 6-7 min or until the pepper is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken and pepper is cooking, add your rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked with a slight bite, drain the noodles and set aside</p><br><br>

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min or until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the chicken and pepper</p><br><br>
