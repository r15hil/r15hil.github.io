<p><strong>Description:</strong> Yasai translates to ‘vegetable’ in Japan - in this case, meaty golden aubergine. The traditional sauce is thick and mild, which is great if you love the flavour of curry but aren't a fan of heat. The lightly pickled salad is just the ticket to counterbalance that rich sauce.</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Peel, top and tail the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Continue to peel lengths off the carrot until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Once you've peeled as far as you can, grate the inner stem&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span>&nbsp;boiled water&nbsp;


Once caramelised, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;flour to the carrot mix and cook for 1 min


Stir in the stock and a large pinch&nbsp;of sugar, mixing well to combine


Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-10 min over a low heat or until thickened - this is your curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the spring onions finely


Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks&nbsp;


Combine the carrot ribbons, spring onion, coriander and rice vinegar in a bowl and mix together gently - this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked aubergine over the rice with the curry sauce spooned over and the salad to the side


Tip: for an authentic presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out onto your plate


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
