<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water and add to a pot with a lid with 180ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[270ml] </span>[360ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the quinoa is cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving

Meanwhile, pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Add the steak[s] to a plate with your ground cumin, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and turn until coated

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the steak is cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes into quarters

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes and sliced spring onion to a bowl with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the steak is resting, return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips and cook for 5-6 min or until tender and starting to char</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander & parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and cut your lemon[s] in half

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the chopped parsley, coriander and garlic to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and a small splash of cold water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Grind the herbs to a paste, then add your natural yoghurt, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the juice of half your lemon[s] – this is your chimichurri yoghurt

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak finely on a clean board and cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the sliced steak with the quinoa, charred peppers, tomato salsa and sliced avocado to the side

Drizzle the chimichurri yoghurt all over

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
