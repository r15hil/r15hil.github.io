<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Tear your ciabatta[s] into chunky bite-sized pieces

Add the halved tomatoes and torn ciabatta to a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Squeeze the halved tomatoes together with the torn ciabatta so that the juice soaks into the bread – this is your marinated ciabatta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the marinated ciabatta to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until the sweetcorn and marinated ciabatta are golden and crispy – these are your charred sweetcorn cobettes & tomatoey croutons

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add 2/3 of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later), the sliced mushrooms, ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until browned and softened – these are your smoky mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Cut your avocado[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly

Combine your mayo, dried oregano, remaining garlic, cider vinegar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your ranch-style dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sweetcorn is charred and crispy, stand the charred sweetcorn cobettes upright and carefully slice the corn from the cobs using a sharp knife – this is your charred corn</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, layer the shredded lettuce, tomatoey croutons, diced avocado, smoky mushrooms and charred corn in rows

Drizzle the ranch-style dressing over everything – this is your plant-based cobb salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
