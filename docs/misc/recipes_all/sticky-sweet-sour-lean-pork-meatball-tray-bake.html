<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sweet potato wedges to a large baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 10 min or until the wedges are starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your lean pork mince and diced onion in a bowl with your five-spice mix

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Shape into 4 meatballs per person (they don't have to look perfect!) – these are your five-spice meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the wedges have had an initial 10 min remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the chopped pepper, onion wedges, chopped pineapple and the five-spice meatballs

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the wedges are golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your cornflour, soy sauce, tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the reserved pineapple juice in a pot

Cook over a medium heat for 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your sweet & sour sauce

Once the meatballs are cooked through add the sweet & sour sauce to the tray[s] and give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky sweet & sour lean pork meatball tray bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky sweet & sour lean pork meatball tray bake on plates and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
