<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Add your basmati rice, cardamom pod[s] and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your chickpeas, then add them to a large bowl with half your garam masala, half your curry powder and half your cultured coconut (save the rest for later!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Add the spiced chickpeas to a baking paper-lined baking tray and place in the oven for 12-15 min or until the chickpeas are starting to char – these are your tandoori chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped garlic and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!) to a small bowl with a large knob of butter and stir it all together – this is your plant-based garlic & coriander butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once softened, add your ginger & garlic paste, remaining garam masala and remaining curry powder to the pan and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the remaining cultured coconut, tandoori chickpeas (reserve the tray) and remaining chopped coriander – this is your chickpea curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>To make the perfect burrito, top each tortilla with some spinach, cardamom rice and chickpea curry, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll your tortilla until you’re left with a burrito – these are your chickpea burritos

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chickpea burritos to the reserved baking tray and put in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp

Once browned, remove the tray from the oven and spread the plant-based garlic & coriander butter over the burritos – these are your plant-based garlic & coriander butter chickpea burritos</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the plant-based garlic & coriander butter chickpea burritos in half and serve

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
