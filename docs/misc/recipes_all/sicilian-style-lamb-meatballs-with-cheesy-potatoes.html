<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up then put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until lightly golden and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your lamb mince to a bowl with the grated onion, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), your dried oregano, sultanas and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide<span class="text-danger"> </span>and shape them into 3 meatballs per person – these are your lamb meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later

Discard any excess oil from the pan and return to a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the diced onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, add the remaining chopped garlic and balsamic sun-dried tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes to the pan with your beef stock mix, 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and return the browned lamb meatballs to the pan

Cook, covered for 12-15 min, stirring occasionally, or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a ragù-like consistency – these are your Sicilian-style lamb meatballs

While the meatballs are cooking, wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After the initial 20 min, remove the potatoes from the oven and crush them firmly with the base of a mug or a spatula

Sprinkle over half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous pinch of pepper

Tip: Crowd the potatoes together for the best melty cheese!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 7-8 min or until golden – these are your cheesy potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sicilian-style lamb meatballs with the cheesy potatoes to the side

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese over the meatballs

Garnish with your salad and top with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
