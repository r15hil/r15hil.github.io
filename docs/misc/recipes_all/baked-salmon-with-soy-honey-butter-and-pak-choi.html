<p><strong>Description:</strong> Cooking ‘en papillote’ (meaning in a sealed envelope) is a brilliantly simple way to keep fish succulent whilst creating an easy flavour-packed sauce. This Asian-inspired dish packs a punch from zingy ginger and a salty-sweet balance from soy sauce and honey. Served with rice and cashew nuts.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter into small pieces

Cut 2 long rectangles of tin foil (approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper), overlap the foil and place on a baking tray (cooking for 4 or more? Do this twice!)

Tip: Overlapping the foil ensures that the fish is completely encased for cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place your salmon fillet[s] in the centre of the doubled foil

Scatter with the chopped ginger and dot the butter evenly over

Drizzle your soy sauce, honey and rice vinegar evenly over the salmon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Scrunch the edges of the foil together around the fish to form a sealed parcel[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your baked salmon with soy honey butter

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the salmon is cooking, wash your pak choi, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Slice the pak choi in half lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the halved pak choi, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly brown

Season with a pinch of salt

Once brown, add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until soft</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cashew nuts to a separate baking tray and put them in the oven for 3-4 min or until they have darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once cooled, chop them coarsely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked salmon over the cooked rice with the pak choi to the side

Spoon the soy honey butter over the salmon and garnish with the toasted cashews

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
