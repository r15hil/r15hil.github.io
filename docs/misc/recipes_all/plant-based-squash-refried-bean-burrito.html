<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your butternut squash cubes to a tray with your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the butternut squash is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a separate pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained black beans, ground cumin and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce, juice of half your lime[s] and a splash of water and mash until smooth – these are your refried beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a small bowl with the juice of the remaining lime and a pinch of sugar – this is your zingy chipotle dressing

Tear your cheese flavour slice[s] into small pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the butternut squash is almost done, add your tortillas to a tray and put the tray in the oven for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Stir the chopped coriander and sliced spring onion through the cooked rice – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top half of each warmed tortilla with some coriander rice, refried beans, roasted butternut squash, your smashed avocado and torn cheeze

Drizzle over the zingy chipotle dressing

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To make the perfect burrito, fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you're left with a burrito – these are your butternut squash & refried bean burritos

Wrap the burritos in tin foil to hold everything together, then slice in half

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
