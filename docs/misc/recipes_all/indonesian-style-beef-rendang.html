<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the halved green beans to the pot

Cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice and beans are cooking, peel and roughly chop (or grate) the garlic and ginger

Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pods

Grind the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, cardamom seeds, 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> black pepper (freshly ground is best!) and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a coarse paste – this is your spice paste</p><br><br>
