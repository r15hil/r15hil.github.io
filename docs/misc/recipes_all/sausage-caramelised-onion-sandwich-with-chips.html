<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice 3/4 of your red onion[s]

Dice the remaining onion finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the onion has completely softened, stirring frequently</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and the diced onion to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sausage patty[ies] and cook for 5 min on each side, turning once, or until the patty is browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Press the patty down with a spatula to keep it nice and flat throughout cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has completely softened, add half of your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) and tomato ketchup with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> cold water

Cook for 4-5 min further or until caramelised

Tip: Watch the onion like a hawk and stir frequently to make sure it doesn't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the onion is caramelising, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Add the ciabatta halves, cut-side up, to a separate baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-6 min or until they're hot and crusty

Wash your salad then pat dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad and remaining balsamic vinegar in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread your mayo over the toasted ciabatta base, then top with a handful of dressed salad, a sausage patty, some caramelised onion and a toasted ciabatta lid – this is your sausage & caramelised onion sandwich

Serve with the chips and remaining dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
