<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the shallot has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, tear your mozzarella into bite-sized pieces and add to some kitchen paper

Press down on the torn mozzarella with another piece of kitchen paper to squeeze out as much liquid as you can

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine the halved cherry tomatoes and a small drizzle of olive oil in a bowl with a grind of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the drained macaroni to an oven-proof dish

Add the tomato pasta sauce and mix it all together

Top with the torn mozzarella, grated cheddar cheese and halved cherry tomatoes

Put the dish under the grill for 8-10 min or until all the cheese is melted and golden – this is your cheesy tomato macaroni bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, leave the cheesy tomato macaroni bake to stand for 5 min before digging in (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
