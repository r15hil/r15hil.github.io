<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and chop your shallots into wedges, then peel and chop your garlic roughly

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the outer green pod (reserve the seeds!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cardamom seeds to a pestle & mortar with your ground cumin, coriander seeds and a pinch of salt and grind to a coarse powder – this is your curry spice mix

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, crush the coriander seeds by squashing them with the side of a knife

Add the chopped ginger and garlic to a food processor with half the shallot wedges (you'll use the rest later), your curry spice mix and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and blitz until smooth – this is your Malaysian-style curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add your coconut stock and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the veg is tender – this is your Malaysian-style coconutty pepper & aubergine curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Malaysian-style coconutty pepper & aubergine curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
