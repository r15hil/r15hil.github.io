<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, line a baking tray with tin foil and add the salmon and marinade (scrunch up the edges of tin foil to stop the marinade escaping!)


Put the tray in the oven for 5-7 min or until the salmon is cooked through


Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to the pan with the softened onion


Add the remaining soy sauce and a generous grind of black pepper&nbsp;


Give everything a good old mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until the rice is beginning to crisp slightly &ndash; this is your Chinese rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the&nbsp;glazed salmon&nbsp;over the Chinese rice


Drizzle over any remaining marinade


Garnish with the black sesame seeds&nbsp;


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
