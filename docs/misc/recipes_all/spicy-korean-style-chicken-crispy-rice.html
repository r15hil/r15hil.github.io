<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

Meanwhile, add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered for 12-15 min or until all the water has been absorbed

Remove the lid and cook over a high heat for 3-4 min further until the rice is starting to crisp on the bottom of the pan – this is your crispy rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, top, tail, and grate (no need to peel!) the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add the chopped garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for 1 min

Transfer the softened pepper, ginger and garlic (reserve the pan) to a food processor with the chilli flakes, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Blitz until smooth – this is your Korean sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut the chicken thighs into rough bite-sized pieces

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken thigh pieces with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until browned all over

Add the grated carrot and sliced spring greens and cook for a further 4-5 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Add the Korean sauce and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy Korean-style chicken</p><br><br>
