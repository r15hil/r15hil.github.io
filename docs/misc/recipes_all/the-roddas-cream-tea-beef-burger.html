<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato discs to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Spread the potato discs into a single layer and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your salt & pepper slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut 2 slices per person from your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and set these aside for later

Chop the remaining tomato finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, then once hot, add the chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to break down

Once the tomato has started to break down, add your tomato paste, red wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your warming tomato jam</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the jam is done, transfer it to a bowl and leave to cool

Tip: The jam will thicken whilst it cools!

Meanwhile, add your beef mince and beef stock mix to a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!) and put in the fridge until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash, then separate your lettuce leaves and pat dry with kitchen paper

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly toasted

Once done, set aside until serving (save the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the beef patty[ies], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the patty[ies] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top the toasted brioche base with the lettuce leaves, sliced tomato and a beef patty, then spoon over the warming tomato jam and the clotted cream (in whichever order you like!) and top with the toasted brioche lid – this is your Rodda’s cream tea beef burger

Serve with the salt & pepper slices to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
