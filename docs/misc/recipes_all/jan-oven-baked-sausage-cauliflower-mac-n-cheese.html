<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a medium-high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Mix 3/4 of the grated cheddar (reserve the rest for a topping!) with your cornflour – this is your floured cheese</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your cauliflower into small florets

Once the sausage meat is beginning to brown, add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[550ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water to the pot with your chicken stock mix and wholegrain mustard

Add your cauliflower florets and macaroni and stir it all together</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, season with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pasta and cauliflower is tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the macaroni and cauliflower are tender, remove the dish from the oven and add the floured cheese with 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [160ml] </span>milk and your soft cheese and give it a good mix up until well combined

Top with the remaining cheese (don't mix!) and a grind of pepper and return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for a final 3-4 min or until the sauce is thickened and the cheese has melted – this is your oven baked sausage & cauliflower mac 'n' cheese</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your oven baked sausage & cauliflower mac 'n' cheese

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle with your balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
