<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice, chopped ginger, a pinch of salt and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your ginger rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, combine your red chilli relish, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add them to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Season the hake with a pinch of salt and spread the sweet chilli sauce over evenly

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your sweet chilli hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the hake is in the oven, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and cut in half, separating the white bases and green tops

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pak choi white bases and sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has browned slightly

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pak choi is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add the pak choi green tops and your soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the pak choi green tops have wilted

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the wilted pak choi – this is your sesame pak choi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet chilli hake over the ginger rice with the sesame pak choi to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
