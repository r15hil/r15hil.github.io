<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel half your red onion[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and slice into thin rings

Add the red onion rings to a shallow bowl with your red wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chips are in the oven, peel and grate the remaining red onion

Add the grated red onion, panko breadcrumbs and beef mince to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 1 patty per person

Add the patty[ies] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the patty[ies] are cooking, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped parsley and mint to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and a small splash of cold water

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely!

Grind the herbs to a paste, then add your mayo, chopped garlic, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tsp]</span> of the red wine vinegar from the quick-pickled onion – this is your chimichurri mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the patty is done, remove the tray from the oven and top with the grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy patty[ies]

While the cheese is melting, separate your lettuce into leaves, then wash them thoroughly and pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top your toasted brioche base with a few lettuce leaves, a cheesy patty, some quick-pickled onion, a dollop of chimichurri mayo and the toasted brioche lid

Serve the chips, any remaining lettuce leaves and remaining chimichurri mayo to the side

Top the lettuce leaves with any remaining quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
