<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary, and if you like your steak well-done, it may take you a little longer than 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Heat a separate dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season all over with salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to one of the pans

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the steak is cooking, add a generous knob of butter to the other pan

Drain your sweetcorn

Once melted, add the drained sweetcorn with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until golden brown – this is your charred buttery corn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and red chilli relish in a bowl – this is your spicy mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your vinaigrette

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

On a clean board, slice the rested steak into strips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced steak with the charred corn rice and salad to the side

Drizzle the spicy mayo over the steak and the vinaigrette over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
