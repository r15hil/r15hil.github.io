<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Separate the white fat and the duck jelly from your duck leg[s], then discard

Add the duck to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your cucumber into matchsticks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] in half, then slice lengthways into thin strips

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Peel and grate your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil and grated garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Go easy!) in a bowl with half your hoisin sauce (save the rest for later!) – this is your hoisin dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] into small bite-sized pieces

Add the sliced ciabatta to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, half your five-spice mix (you'll use the rest later!) and most of your toasted sesame seeds and your black sesame seeds (save some for garnish!)

Season with a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until golden and crisp – these are your sesame croutons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the duck to a clean board and shred apart using two forks (watch out for any bones!) – this technique is known as 'pulling'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the pulled duck to a large bowl with the remaining hoisin sauce and remaining five-spice mix

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled hoisin duck</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Toss the sliced spring onion, cucumber matchsticks, carrot ribbons and shredded lettuce together in a large bowl – this is your Asian-style salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Asian-style salad topped with the pulled hoisin duck and sesame croutons

Drizzle over the hoisin dressing and garnish with the remaining toasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
