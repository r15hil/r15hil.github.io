<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with your roasted garlic paste and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Combine the bashed cucumber, toasted sesame oil, half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl and set aside – this is your smashed sesame cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mince is beginning to brown, add the remaining soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and hoisin sauce to the pan and stir it all together

Add your honey to the pan and cook for a further 4 min or until the mince is a little sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your honey hoisin pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, drain the noodles in a sieve</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles to the pan with the pork and give everything a good mix up – these are your honey hoisin pork noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the honey hoisin pork noodles with the smashed sesame cucumber to the side

Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
