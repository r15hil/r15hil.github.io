<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and soy sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your Thai green curry paste and ginger paste to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Tip: Be careful – the ginger will sizzle from the heat of the oil!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and your chopped green beans to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you’re cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce is beginning to thicken, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the pan with a generous pinch of salt

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the haddock is cooking, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can

Add the wilted spinach to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai green haddock & green bean curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai green haddock & green bean curry over the cooked brown rice

Season with a generous pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
