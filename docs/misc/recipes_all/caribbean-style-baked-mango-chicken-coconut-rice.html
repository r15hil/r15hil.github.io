<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil a kettle

Top, tail and peel the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>, then stand the mango<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the mango flesh into bite-sized pieces, discarding the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Dissolve the chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water with the smoked paprika, ground cumin and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2tsp]</span> sugar – this is your spiced stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear

Add the rinsed rice to an oven-proof dish with the spiced stock and a very generous pinch of salt

Add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic, chopped beans and chopped mango and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top with the browned chicken thighs

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water has absorbed, the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baked mango & chicken coconut rice</p><br><br>
