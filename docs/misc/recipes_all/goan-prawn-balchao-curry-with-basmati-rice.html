<p><strong>Description:</strong> The word ‘balchão’ in this dish refers to the use of vinegar as a way of preserving fish and meat, and it's what gives this curry its fiery sour flavour. Serve as they would in Goa, over hot basmati rice. All Health Hub recipes meet one of these criteria: <600 calories, 3 of your 5/day, or a source of protein.
