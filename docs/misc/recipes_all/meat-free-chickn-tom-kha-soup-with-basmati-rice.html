<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin, then remove the tough outer layer<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>finely

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice, tough outer lemongrass layer<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened, then, slice the chestnut mushrooms finely and chop the creamed coconut roughly

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar and the chopped creamed coconut in 600ml<span class="text-danger"> [1.2L] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped lemongrass, chopped ginger, sliced mushrooms and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and cook 1 min

Add the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 6-7 min or until the mushrooms have softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the pulled meat-free chick'n to the pan with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the meat-free chick'n is warmed through – this is your meat-free chick'n tom kha soup

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Discard the outer lemongrass layers from the basmati rice

Serve the meat-free chick'n tom kha soup in bowls with the basmati rice

Garnish with the coriander leaves, chopped coriander stalks and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
