<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips (save these for later!)

Add the sweet potato wedges to a baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min

Add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter to a bowl and microwave for 10 secs or until melted (alternatively, melt the butter in a small pot over a medium heat)

Add your toasted sesame seeds, honey and half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) to the bowl and mix everything together – this is your sesame butter mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Cut your lime[s] into 2 wedges per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, then add the chopped pepper and drizzle over half the sesame butter mix

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for a further 10-15 min or until the sweet potato wedges are golden and cooked through – these are your sticky wedges & roasted pepper

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and a tiny splash of cold water to the remaining sesame butter mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While everything's in the oven, add the remaining soy sauce to a plate with your basa fillet[s]

Turn the basa several times until the soy sauce fully soaks into the fish

Sprinkle your cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated – this is your coated basa

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden, crisped and cooked through – this is your crispy soy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the crispy soy basa to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat

Add the sesame butter mix to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until it starts to thicken

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and add the juice of half the lime[s] – this is your sesame, honey & lime sauce

Tip: Not a fan of lime? Just add a little!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy soy basa with the sticky wedges & roasted pepper to the side

Drizzle over the sesame, honey & lime sauce

Garnish with the chopped coriander, sliced spring onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
