<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s], season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi has started to crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add the sun-dried tomato stock and your crème fraîche

Add your blanched peas and the wilted spinach and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash more water if your gnocchi is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked salmon on top of the creamy sun-dried tomato gnocchi

Finish with a few grinds of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
