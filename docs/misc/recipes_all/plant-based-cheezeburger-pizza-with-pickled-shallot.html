<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and umami seasoning and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, remove the pan from the heat and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the meat-free mince is cooking, put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel and slice your shallot[s] as thinly as you can

Grate your cheddar flavour block[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with your cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste to a separate bowl with the grated garlic and a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Divide the tomato base between your pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the meat-free mince and grated cheeze

Tip: Make sure the pizza[s] don’t overlap on the tray[s] to avoid raw dough!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your ketchup and mustard ketchup in a bowl with a splash of cold water – this is your burger sauce

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based cheezeburger pizza and top with the pickled shallot and a drizzle of burger sauce

Garnish with the salad and drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
