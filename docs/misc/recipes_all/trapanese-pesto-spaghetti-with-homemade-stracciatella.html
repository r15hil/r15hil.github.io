<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs and dried basil with a pinch of pepper

Cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden, then transfer to a plate and reserve the pan – these are your herby breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into small pieces and add them to a medium bowl with your soft cheese, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>cold water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good stir – this is your homemade stracciatella</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the spaghetti is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Wipe out the reserved pan and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the sliced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have softened, add your tomato paste to the pan with your sun-dried tomato pesto, vegetable stock mix, ground almonds and a very generous splash of starchy pasta water

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant, then add the drained spaghetti

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 30 secs – this is your Trapanese-style pesto spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more starchy cooking water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Trapanese-style pesto spaghetti topped with the homemade stracciatella and herby breadcrumbs

Serve with the salad to the side and top with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
