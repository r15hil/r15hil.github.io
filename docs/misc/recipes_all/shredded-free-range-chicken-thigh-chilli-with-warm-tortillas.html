<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet to let it and let it air

Add your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until combined

Add your free range chicken thighs to the plate and turn them several times until evenly coated in all the spices</p><br><br>
