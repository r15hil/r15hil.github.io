<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and grate your garlic

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your diced beef to a bowl with the grated garlic, half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt

Tip: Unevenly sized diced beef? Chop any larger pieces into smaller ones!

Add your cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to the marinated beef and give everything a good mix up until the beef is fully coated – this is your coated beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated beef to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer to a plate and set aside – this is your crispy beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the beef is cooking, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion petals and pepper strips with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your red chilli relish, tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl – this is your chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the crispy beef and chilli sauce to the pan and stir it all together

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chilli beef</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy chilli beef over the cooked rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
