<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife, discarding the outer green pods</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add your lamb mince to the pan and cook for 4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the mince is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, tamarind paste and a generous pinch of sugar in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the lamb mince has browned, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and cardamom seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your ground turmeric, ground coriander and ground cumin with a very generous grind of black pepper and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the halved green beans to the pan with the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 5-6 min or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the lamb is cooked and coated in a thick sauce (no pink meat!) – this is your Indonesian-style lamb mince & green bean curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indonesian-style lamb mince & green bean curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
