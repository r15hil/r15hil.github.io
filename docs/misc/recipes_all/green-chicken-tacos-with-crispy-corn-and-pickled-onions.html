<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Drain your sweetcorn, then add it to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the corn is in the oven, peel your garlic

Cut your green chilli[es] in half and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)

Peel and halve your shallot[s]

Cut your pepper[s] into quarters (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the garlic to a food processor with most of the coriander (reserve a few leaves for garnish!), the halved green chilli[es] (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half of the shallot[s] and pepper quarters

Add your toasted sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds, season with a generous pinch of salt and blitz into a rough paste – this is your pepper paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Finely slice the remaining shallot

Add the sliced shallot to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and mix well – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once golden, add the pepper paste to the chicken and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Add the coconut stock and cook, covered, for 12-15 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your pulled chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load up the warmed tortillas with the pulled chicken, crispy corn and quick-pickled shallot

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
