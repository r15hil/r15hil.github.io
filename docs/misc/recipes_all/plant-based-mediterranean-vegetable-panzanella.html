<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your baking tray and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to a large baking tray (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into strips

Add the pepper strips to the baking tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Add your cherry tomatoes and crushed garlic to the baking tray[s]

Drizzle everything generously with olive oil and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Give everything a really good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min – these are your Mediterranean-style vegetables

Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar, with your Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your vinaigrette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the Mediterranean-style vegetables have been roasting for 20 min, remove the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven and tear your ciabatta[s] into large pieces over the top and drizzle the torn ciabatta with a little olive oil

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 6-7 min further or until the ciabatta is lightly golden and starting to crisp, then sprinkle over your pine kernel & seed mix and return to the oven for a final 3-4 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Carefully squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skin and discard the skin

To serve, top the salad with the Mediterranean-style vegetables, crispy ciabatta, roasted garlic and toasted pine kernels & seeds – this is your Mediterranean-style vegetable panzanella

Tear your basil leaves all over, drizzle over the vinaigrette, season with a grind of black pepper and dig in!</p><br><br>
