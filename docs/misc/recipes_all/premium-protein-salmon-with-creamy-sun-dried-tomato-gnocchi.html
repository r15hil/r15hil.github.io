<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 6-8 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your salmon fillet[s] (skin-side down), season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and roughly chop your garlic</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

Add your chopped garlic and balsamic sundried tomato paste and stir it all together – this is your sundried tomato stock</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi has started to crisp, reduce the heat to medium and add the sundried tomato stock and crème fraîche

Add your blanched peas and wilted spinach and cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash more water if your gnocchi is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked salmon on top of the creamy sun-dried tomato gnocchi

Finish with a few grinds of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
