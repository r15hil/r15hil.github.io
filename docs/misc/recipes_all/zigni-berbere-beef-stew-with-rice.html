<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and cut your shallot[s] in half

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into strips

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins

Cut your ginger in half (no need to peel!)</p><br><br>
