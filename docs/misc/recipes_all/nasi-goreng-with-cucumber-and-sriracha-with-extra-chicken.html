<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and reserve the pan

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Wash your shredded kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, remove it from the heat, then add the brown rice with your roasted garlic paste, grated carrot, shredded kale and sliced spring onion

Return the pan to the heat, then add your toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar and cook for 2-3 min or until fully combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 3 min or until cooked to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan with the rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your nasi goreng

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the nasi goreng and top it with a fried egg and chicken

Garnish with the sliced cucumber, roasted peanuts and a lime wedge

Squeeze over your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
