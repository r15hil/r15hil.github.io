<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your chestnut mushrooms into quarters

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, mushroom quarters, half your ground smoked paprika and half the chopped thyme (save the rest for later!) to the pan

Season with salt and a generous amount of pepper

Spread the mushrooms out as much as possible and allow to cook, without stirring, for 5-10 min or until caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, combine the remaining chopped thyme, crème fraîche and a generous amount of pepper in a bowl – this is your seasoned crème fraîche

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once caramelised, add half of your vegetable stock (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan, increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the stock has completely absorbed

Add the remaining ground smoked paprika and stir well</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine and the remaining vegetable stock to the pan, then cook until reduced and thickened

Once thickened, add the seasoned crème fraîche and stir to combine – this is your creamy mushroom stroganoff

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy mushroom stroganoff and season with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
