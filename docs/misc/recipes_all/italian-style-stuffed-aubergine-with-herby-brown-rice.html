<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways (including the stalk[s]), then score the aubergine flesh with a sharp knife in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin, then rub the flesh with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the scored aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side down, and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the flesh is tender and golden brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with a matching lid with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and slice your red onion[s] finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Crush your walnuts in their bag with a rolling pin (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and chopped tomato to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have softened

Once softened, add your balsamic sun-dried tomato paste to the pan with half your vegetable stock mix (save the rest for later!), dried basil and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant, then crumble half your goats’ cheese (you’ll use the rest later!) into the pan, stir it all together and keep covered – this is your stuffing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is tender, carefully scoop out the flesh, taking care not to break the skin, and roughly chop the flesh

Add the chopped aubergine flesh to the stuffing and mix it all together

Divide the aubergine stuffing between the aubergine skin[s] and top with the remaining goats' cheese and crushed walnuts

Return the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 4-5 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your Italian-style stuffed aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining vegetable stock mix to your cooked rice with half the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and cook over a low heat for 1-2 min or until warmed through – this is your herby brown rice

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Toss the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Italian-style stuffed aubergine with the herby brown rice and dressed salad to the side

Garnish the aubergine with the remaining chopped parsley and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
