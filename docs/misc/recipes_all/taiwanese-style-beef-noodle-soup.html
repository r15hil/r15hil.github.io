<h4>Step 1</h4>

Transfer the cooked beef strips to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the beef stock to the pan with the rice vinegar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the sliced spring greens and any resting juices from the beef strips

Stir it all together and cook for 2 min further or until the spring greens are bright green and wilted â€“ this is your fragrant broth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Arrange the drained noodles, wilted spring greens and beef strips in bowls

Pour the fragrant broth all over
