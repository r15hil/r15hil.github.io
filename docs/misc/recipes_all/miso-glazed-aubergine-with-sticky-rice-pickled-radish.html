<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle, then top, tail and slice the radishes and peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in<span class="text-danger"> </span>lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Add the carrot ribbons and sliced radishes to a bowl with half the rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a generous pinch of sugar and 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> boiled water, give everything a mix and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the aubergines in half lengthways (including the stalks), then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper and add the aubergine halves

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the flesh of each aubergine half and put the tray in the oven for an initial 30 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, combine the white miso paste and agave in a small bowl with the mirin, remaining rice vinegar, soy sauce and toasted sesame oil and stir it all together – this is your miso glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the aubergines have been in the oven for 30 min, top them with the miso glaze

Tip: Make sure the glaze gets into the gaps!

Return the tray<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven for a further 5-6 min or until the aubergines are caramelised and cooked through – this is your miso-glazed aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the aubergines caramelise, trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drain the quick-pickled veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the miso-glazed aubergine with the sticky rice and quick-pickled veg to the side

Tip: Drizzle over any remaining glaze from the tray!

Garnish with the black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
