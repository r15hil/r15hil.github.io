<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded fish and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your crispy breaded fish

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trims the green beans

Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add the green beans to the pot and cook for a further 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once done, drain and return them to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil, the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon quarter<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the crispy breaded fish with the garlic butter – this is your garlicky breaded fish

Serve the tender green beans and potatoes to the side, and garnish with a remaining lemon quarter

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
