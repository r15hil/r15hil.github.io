<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your tomato paste to a bowl with the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to another bowl along with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your chilli oil

Pick your basil leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 per person

Toss your dough ball[s] in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go<span class="text-danger"> </span>(no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press your dough ball[s] in the centre and gently push outwards, with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Keep going until your base is slightly smaller than a side plate (you will make it bigger in the pan!) – this is your pizza base

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (or two), (preferably non-stick) over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, carefully add the pizza base[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the pan[s], pushing the dough out to the edge to help shape the crust

Tip: To pick up the pizza dough, gently flip it over the back of your hand to stop it ripping!

Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon (be careful of the hot pan!)

Cook the pizza base[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>for 3-4 min or until the crust has started to puff up, then remove the heated tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>from the oven and slide the pizza base[s] onto the tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Repeat this process for the remaining pizza base[s]

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!

Top with your torn mozzarella, dried oregano and basil leaves then drizzle the chilli oil all over, even on the crust (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your DIY pizza Margherita with chilli oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the halved cherry tomatoes to a bowl with the salad, balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressed salad

Sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese over the DIY pizza Margherita with chilli oil and serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
