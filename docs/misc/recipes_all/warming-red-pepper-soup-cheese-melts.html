<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped pepper, red onion wedges and crushed garlic in a mixing bowl

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Just add a little!) and mix well

Season to taste with salt and pepper – this is your seasoned veg

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Spread both the inside and outside of each ciabatta half with butter, then sandwich the grated cheese between two slices – this is your cheese sandwich[es]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and once hot, add the cheese sandwich[es] and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (e.g. several cans) to the top pan and cook for 2-3 min per side, checking occasionally – this is your cheese melt[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the tray of roasted vegetables from the oven, then add them to the tomato stock

Add in your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Blitz together until smooth, then add the blitzed soup to a pan over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through

Serve in bowls and season generously with salt and plenty of pepper – this is your warming pepper soup</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the cheese melt[s] into thirds lengthways – these are your cheese melt soldiers

Serve the cheese melt soldiers alongside the warming pepper soup

Drizzle the soup with olive oil and season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
