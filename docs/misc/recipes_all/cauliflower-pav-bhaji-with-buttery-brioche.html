Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pan and stir it all together

Cook for 1-2 min further or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your cauliflower pav bhaji

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cauliflower pav bhaji

Top with the golden cauliflower and crispy cauliflower leaves and serve the chilli brioche to the side

Garnish with the reserved chopped coriander, remaining chopped red onion and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
