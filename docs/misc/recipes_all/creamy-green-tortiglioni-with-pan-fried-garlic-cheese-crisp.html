<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until golden

Tip: Watch the garlic like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!

Once golden, transfer the garlic to kitchen paper, set aside and reserve the pan for later – this is your pan-fried garlic

Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 7-8 min or until cooked with a bite

Tip: This will finish cooking in the sauce later!

Drain the tortiglioni and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

While the pasta is cooking, chop the basil finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach then add it to a food processor with the chopped garlic, chopped basil, cashew nuts and dried oregano

Add half the blanched peas, half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!), vegetable stock mix, soft cheese and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>cold water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your creamy green cashew sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the creamy green cashew sauce and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the tortiglioni, sliced spring onion and remaining blanched peas with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 4-5 min, stirring occasionally, or until the pasta is fully coated and creamy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, add a small piece of baking paper to a plate

Divide the remaining grated Italian hard cheese into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>piles on the baking paper and microwave for 1 min or until melted

Set aside to cool and harden – these are your cheese crisps</p><br><br>
