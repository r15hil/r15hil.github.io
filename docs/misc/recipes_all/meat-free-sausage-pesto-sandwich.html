<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once everything is almost cooked, add your ciabatta[s] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Meanwhile, combine the remaining red wine vinegar with drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Carefully slice your ciabatta[s] in half and spread with the cheddar pesto

Top with the sliced tomato, meat-free sausages and a small handful of salad – this is your sausage & pesto sandwich</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage & pesto sandwich with the potato wedges and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
