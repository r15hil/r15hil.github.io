<h4>Step 1</h4>

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until lightly browned and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[90ml] </span>boiled water then add your dried oregano and stir together – this is your herby stock

Drain and rinse your green lentils</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add the chopped garlic and chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your herby stock and drained lentils with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your lentil filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your grated Italian hard cheese in a pot with your cornflour and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until the cheese is fully coated

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk to the pot and stir it all together

Cook over a medium-high heat for 3-4 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your white sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the lentil filling has thickened, transfer to an oven-proof dish

Top with the roasted aubergine slices

Cover with the white sauce, spreading it over the aubergine slices with the back of a spoon until evenly coated

Top with the chopped lighter cheese and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden – this is your aubergine & lentil moussaka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the aubergine & lentil moussaka to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Garnish with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
