<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your leek[s] thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves then top, tail and slice into rounds

Add the sliced leek to the dish</p><br><br>

<p>Add your chicken stock mix to the dish with your tortiglioni, Chinese rice wine and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Nestle the pasta into the water as much as you can, then stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!</p><br><br>
