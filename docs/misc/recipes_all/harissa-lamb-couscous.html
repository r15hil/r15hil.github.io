<p><strong>Description:</strong> Harissa is a North African chilli paste, which is fragrant and a little bit spicy. It adds instant flavour to all manner of dishes, but works particularly well with lamb. Lamb in turn, works really well with aubergine. Here weâ€™ve got a super quick and tasty dish that features four essential Moroccan ingredients: lamb, harissa couscous and mint.				</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Discard the root end of the aubergine<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> and using a vegetable peeler, peel strips off the aubergine lengthways, leaving a gap between each strip (think zebra stripes)


Cut the aubergine into chunky rounds approx. 2cm thick</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a wide-based pan (non-stick is best) with 1-2 tbsp of vegetable oil


When hot, add the aubergine rounds, red onion, and a pinch of salt


Cook on a medium-low heat for 5 min, turning the aubergine half way, and once the aubergine is slightly browned, transfer both to a plate


Reserve the pan for the next step</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle for steps 4 and 6


Add the ras el hanout to the reserved pan and cook for 20 sec, stirring constantly


Add the lamb mince and break it up with a wooden spoon


Cook the lamb in the spice for 5 min, or until starting to colour</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the stock cube<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in 300ml <span class="text-danger">(500ml)</span> of boiled water


Add the harissa paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tsp)</span> of sugar to the stock


This is your harissa stock</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the stock, the cooked aubergine and half of the red onion to the lamb pan, cover with a lid and cook on a rapid simmer for 10 min on a low heat


After the 10 min, remove the lid, turn the aubergines and cook for a further 5 min, or until most of the water has evaporated</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the couscous to a bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> of boiling water and cover well


Set aside for 10 min


Chop the mint leaves and stalks finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the couscous with a fork and stir through the remaining red onion and chopped mint


Season to taste with salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lamb and aubergines over the jewelled couscous


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
