<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Bash the lemongrass with a rolling pin to release the juices and add it to a pot (you may have to cut it to fit) with the rice and 350ml <span class="text-danger">(700ml)</span> water&nbsp;


Bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low, cover and cook for 10-15 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is tender</p><br><br>
