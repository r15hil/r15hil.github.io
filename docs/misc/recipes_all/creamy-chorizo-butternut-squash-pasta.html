<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once crisped, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan – this is your crispy chorizo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and once hot, add the cooked butternut squash (be careful not to tip any of the water into the pan!)

Cook for 3-4 min, or until starting to brown

Once starting to brown, add the sliced shallot to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the creamy stock to the pan with 2/3 of the crispy chorizo (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened

Once thickened, add the drained farfalle with a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the farfalle is evenly coated in the sauce – this is your creamy chorizo & butternut squash farfalle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chorizo & butternut squash farfalle

Sprinkle the remaining crispy chorizo over the top and season with a generous grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
