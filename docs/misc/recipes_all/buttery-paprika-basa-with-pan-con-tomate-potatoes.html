<p>When everything's nearly ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a large knob of butter

Once melted, add your ground paprika and dried oregano with a pinch of salt and mix everything together

Add your basa fillet[s] to the pan with the the juice of half the lemon[s] (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min on each side – this is your buttery paprika basa

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove all of the trays from the oven

Add the cooked spring greens to the cooked potatoes and mix through the pan con tomate dressing until everything is coated – these are your pan con tomate potatoes

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the buttery paprika basa over the pan con tomate potatoes

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper
