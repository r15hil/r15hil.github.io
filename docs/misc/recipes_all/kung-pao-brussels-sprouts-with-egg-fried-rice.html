<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped sprouts and chopped spring onion to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until the sprouts are tender and slightly crispy – these are your roasted sprouts & spring onion

Once tender, remove the tray from the oven and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked white long grain rice and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through – this is your garlic rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate, medium-sized pot over a medium-high heat and once hot, add the remaining chopped garlic and cornflour to the pot with your rice vinegar, red chilli relish, half your gluten free soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), roasted peanuts and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the roasted sprouts & spring onions to the pot and mix it all together – these are your Kung Pao Brussels sprouts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the garlic rice has warmed through, add your blanched peas, your toasted sesame oil, the remaining gluten free soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min until everything is combined

Once combined, push the rice to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] into the other side

Stir the egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the rice – this is your egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Kung Pao Brussels sprouts over the egg fried rice

Garnish with the sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
