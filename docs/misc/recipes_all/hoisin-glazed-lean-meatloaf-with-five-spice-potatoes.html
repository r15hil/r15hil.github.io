<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then peel and finely dice your shallot[s] and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger, then cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with the diced shallot, panko breadcrumbs and half of the chopped garlic

Add half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half of the grated ginger (you'll use the rest later!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Using clean hands, knead the lean pork mixture until fully combined, then add it to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray and shape into a loaf (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to the other side of the tray (or another tray!)

Add your five-spice mix to the chopped potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give them a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 35-40 min or until the meatloaf[ves] is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are crispy

Meanwhile, combine your hoisin sauce and your Chinese rice wine in a small bowl – this is your hoisin glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once cooked through, pour half of the hoisin-glaze over the top of the meatloaf[ves] (save the rest for later!) and sprinkle over your toasted sesame seeds

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until golden and sticky – this is your hoisin glazed lean pork meatloaf and crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While everything's in the oven, wash your pak choi and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut in half and cut the white base into bite-sized pieces

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Once everything is almost done, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped pak choi, carrot ribbons and soy sauce to the pan with the remaining chopped garlic, grated ginger and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 2 min – this is your stir-fried veg

Add the remaining hoisin glaze to a pot with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] [</span>2 tbsp]</span> water and gently heat to warm through (alternatively, pop in the microwave for 1 min to warm through!) – this is your hoisin gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the hoisin-glazed lean pork meatloaf and serve with the crispy potatoes and stir-fried veg to the side

Drizzle over the hoisin gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
