Peel and grate 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> brown onion into a large bowl

Slice the remaining onion finely

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve half<span class="text-danger"> [all]</span> the Knorr beef stock cube in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and add the Henderson's Relish and soy sauce

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>flour and the chopped garlic to the pan with the mushrooms and cook for 30 secs

Add the stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is almost cooked, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Cook, covered for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the patties over the cooked rice and pour the gravy all over

Top with a fried egg and garnish with the sliced spring onion
