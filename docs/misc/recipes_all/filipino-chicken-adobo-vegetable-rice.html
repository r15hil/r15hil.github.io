<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Combine your cornflour, soy sauce, cider vinegar, ginger paste and bay leaf[ves] in a bowl with a generous grind of black pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>sugar – this is your marinade

Add your chicken thighs and set aside for 5 min to marinate</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your marinated chicken (reserve the marinade liquid!) and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the pan (and any remaining oil!) for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

When the rice is boiling, add your Tenderstem broccoli and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your rice & tenderstem</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

Turn the heat down to medium and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the sauce has reduced slightly and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Filipino-style chicken adobo</p><br><br>
