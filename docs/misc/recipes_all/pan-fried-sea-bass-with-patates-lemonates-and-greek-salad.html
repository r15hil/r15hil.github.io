<h4>Step 1</h4>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the potato & onion wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with half your dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the potatoes have slightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the lemon zest strips with a squeeze of lemon juice, the chopped garlic and a knob of butter dotted all over

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 10 min or until golden and slightly caramelised – these are your patatas lemonatas

Cut the squeezed lemon half[ves] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Score your sea bass fillet[s] by drawing a sharp knife through the skin 3 times on the diagonal, taking care not to cut all the way through, then season both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat, then once hot, add the scored sea bass fillet[s], skin side down, and cook for 5 min, then turn and cook for 1 min further until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pan-fried sea bass with the Greek-style salad and patatas lemonatas to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
