<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your garlic cloves to a piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil, then scrunch the foil around the garlic to form a tightly sealed parcel

Add the parcel to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the garlic has softened – this is your roasted garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the garlic is cooking, boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your free range chicken thighs with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and roasted garlic paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[125ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy garlic stock

Once the chicken has browned, add the creamy garlic stock to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken back to the pan with the mashed roasted garlic, drained tortiglioni and a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy roasted garlic & pulled free range chicken tortiglioni</p><br><br>
