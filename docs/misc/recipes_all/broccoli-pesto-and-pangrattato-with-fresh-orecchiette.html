<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your garlic

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fresh orecchiette and halved broccoli to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette and broccoli, reserve the pot and a cup of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add half the cooked broccoli (save the rest for later!) to a food processor with the peeled garlic, flaked almonds, soft cheese, basil and half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later)

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

Add the juice of half your zested lemon[s], 2 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Blitz until you're left with a smooth paste – this is your broccoli pesto

Cut the remaining zested lemon into 1 wedge per person

Once the breadcrumbs are golden, transfer them to a bowl with the lemon zest, give everything a good mix up and set aside for serving – this is your lemony pangrattato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add the drained orecchiette and remaining broccoli

Add the broccoli pesto and stir gently until the pasta is nicely coated in the pesto and everything is warmed through – this is your broccoli pesto orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the broccoli pesto orecchiette with the lemony pangrattato on top

Garnish with a lemon wedge, the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
