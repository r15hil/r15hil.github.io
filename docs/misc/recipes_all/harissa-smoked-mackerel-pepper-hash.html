<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-10 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed your red pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced pepper, sliced onion, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 10-15 min until softened and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once the butter has melted, add the cooked potatoes to the pan

Cook the potatoes for 7-8 min or until they're starting to brown and crisp, crushing them lightly with a fork

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are golden, add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and smoked paprika

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the wilted spinach, roasted pepper & onion, mackerel pieces, a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your smoked mackerel & pepper hash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Make 1 well per person in the smoked mackerel & pepper hash and crack the egg[s] into them, then cook, covered for 5-6 min or until the eggs are cooked to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack them for perfectly centred yolks!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked mackerel & pepper hash with your natural yoghurt and harissa paste dolloped over the top (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
