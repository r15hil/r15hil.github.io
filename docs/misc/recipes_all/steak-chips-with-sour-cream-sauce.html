<p><strong>Description:</strong> Our midweek steak and chips is the answer to home-made comfort food. The flash-fried steak cooks in mere minutes; with a simple pan-sauce made from the meat juices, plenty of black pepper and sour cream. Chips need not be an over-indulgence; their skins are a great source of nutrients so weâ€™ve left them on. </p>
