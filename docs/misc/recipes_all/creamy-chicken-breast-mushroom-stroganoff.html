<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your chestnut mushrooms into quarters

Strip your thyme from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced onion and mushroom quarters to the pan with a splash of cold water and cover with a lid

Cook for 10-12 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks and set aside – this is your pulled chicken

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook the onion and mushrooms for a further 3-4 min or until caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once the onion and mushrooms have caramelised, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and chopped thyme to the pan

Add a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine and pulled chicken to the pan with the chicken stock and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly thickened

Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and add your crème fraîche – this is your creamy chicken breast & mushroom stroganoff

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken breast & mushroom stroganoff and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
