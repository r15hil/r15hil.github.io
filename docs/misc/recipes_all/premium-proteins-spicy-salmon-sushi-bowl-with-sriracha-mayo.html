<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then boil a kettle

Once the pan is hot, add your salmon fillet[s] and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Slice your red chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the salmon is cooking, chop your cucumber roughly

Add the chopped cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold running water until it's cool

Squeeze out any excess water and add the wilted spinach to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil and a pinch of salt – this is your sesame spinach</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Flake the cooked salmon into bite-sized pieces with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the flaked salmon, quick-pickled cucumber, sesame spinach on top of the cooked brown rice and drizzle over the sriracha mayo

Garnish with the sliced spring onion, black sesame seeds and sliced red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
