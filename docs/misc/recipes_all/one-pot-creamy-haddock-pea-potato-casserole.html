<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a knob of butter over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small, rough pieces

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife, then remove the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, crushed garlic, vegetable stock mix and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good stir and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely and set aside for serving

Once boiling, cover the casserole dish with a lid and put it in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are tender

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, remove the dish from the oven and add your blanched peas

Give everything a good stir, then top with your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Return the dish to the oven, uncovered, for 7-8 min or until the haddock is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, stir your crème fraîche through the sauce and season with a generous pinch of salt – this is your one pot creamy haddock, pea & potato casserole

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
