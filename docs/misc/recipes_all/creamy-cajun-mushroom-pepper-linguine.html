<h4>Step 1</h4>

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of salt, a pinch of sugar and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Brush the top side of your portobello mushroom[s] with a little vegetable oil (this helps the spices stick!)

Press the oiled side of the portobello mushroom[s] into the Cajun-style spice mix and save the rest of the spice mix for later – this is your Cajun-style spiced portobello mushroom</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the veg has softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated

Add the creamy stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

Once thickened, add the drained linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy Cajun-style pepper linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the spiced portobello mushroom[s] finely

Serve the sliced spiced portobello mushroom over the creamy Cajun-style pepper linguine

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
