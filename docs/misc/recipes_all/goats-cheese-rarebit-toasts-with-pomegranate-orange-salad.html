<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate[s], then slice into quarters

Add the pomegranate quarters to a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and return to the large bowl</p><br><br>
