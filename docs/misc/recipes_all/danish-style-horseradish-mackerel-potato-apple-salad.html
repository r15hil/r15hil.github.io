<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the skin from your smoked mackerel fillet[s] and discard

After the initial 25 min, take the tray[s] out the oven and add the skinned mackerel fillet[s] to the other side of the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a further 6-7 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp and the mackerel is cooked through (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lamb's lettuce in bowls and spoon over the mackerel & potato mix

Drizzle over the remaining horseradish dressing and garnish with the reserved chopped chives – this is your Danish-style horseradish mackerel, potato & apple salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
