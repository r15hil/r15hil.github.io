<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and cook for 3 min or until beginning to soften

Tip: Try not to stir the mushrooms too often as this will stop them from caramelising!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are softening, boil half a kettle

Chop your pepper[s] in half, deseed (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly

Add the chopped pepper to the pan and cook for 2 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then roughly chop your spring onions

Add them to the pan and cook for 2 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your red Thai curry paste, peanut butter, chopped creamed coconut and soy sauce in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your nutty stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your mangetout and nutty stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened – this is your nutty three veg curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the nutty three veg curry with the white long grain rice to the side

Garnish with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
