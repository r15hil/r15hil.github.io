<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Top, tail and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways (no need to peel)

With the flat side down, make diagonal crosses along the parsnip halves without cutting all the way through

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] in quarters lengthways

Trim the ends off your Brussels sprouts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Line a tray (or two!) with baking paper and add your turkey breast joint[s] to one side

Top each turkey breast joint with a sprig of your rosemary (you’ll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 36-38 min or until it's cooked through and the juices run clear (no pink meat!)

Tip: Set a timer because your turkey will rest until everything else is ready!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them in a colander and shake them until they're fluffy

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the remaining rosemary with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant – this is your rosemary oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the cooked potatoes to one side of a separate baking tray and drizzle over the rosemary oil then reserve the pan

Add the chopped parsnip and chopped carrot to the other side of the baking tray (or a separate one!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min

Divide your pork, sage & onion stuffing (remove any paper!) and shape into 2 stuffing meatballs per person, then boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter

Once melted, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, stirring to form a paste

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your Henderson's Relish and Marmite

Gradually add the stock to the pan and cook for 10-12 min or until thickened – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the veg has been in the oven for 15 min, add the Brussels sprouts to the tray[s], then turn the potatoes and drizzle your honey over the parsnip and carrot and top with a couple of knobs of butter

Add the stuffing meatballs and pigs in blankets to the tray[s] with the turkey and return all the trays to the oven for a further 15-18 min or until the potatoes are crispy and the pigs in blankets are cooked through, once cooked, transfer the turkey to a clean board to rest</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Warm up the gravy over a low heat

Slice the rested turkey finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced turkey with the pigs in blankets, stuffing meatballs, rosemary roast potatoes, honey roast veg and roasted sprouts

Add a dollop of cranberry sauce to the side and drizzle over the gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
