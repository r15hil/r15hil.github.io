<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Boil a kettle


Cut the red peppers in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) 


Add the halved peppers to a baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the peppers have softened and have browned slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 10-15 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt


Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool


Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can, then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped spinach, tomato, garlic and <span class="text-highlight">half the</span> feta (you'll use the rest later!) to the cooked bulgur


Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper


Give everything a good mix up <span class="text-highlight">–</span> this is your filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the peppers have softened, remove the tray from the oven


Carefully fill each pepper half with the filling


Tip: pile the peppers high with filling!


Return the stuffed peppers to the oven and cook for 5 min further or until the filling has <span class="text-highlight">warmed</span> through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the natural yoghurt, oregano and remaining<span class="text-highlight"> feta</span> to a bowl and blitz until smooth with a stick blender – this is your feta sauce


Tip: if you don't have a stick blender use a food processor or mash it all together with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the stuffed peppers with the lamb's lettuce<span class="text-highlight"> to the</span> side


Drizzle the <span class="text-highlight">lamb's lettuce</span> with olive oil and <span class="text-highlight">season with</span> a pinch of salt


Top the peppers with the pumpkin seeds and drizzle over the feta sauce


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
