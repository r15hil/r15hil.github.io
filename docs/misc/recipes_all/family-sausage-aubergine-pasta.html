<p><strong>Description:</strong> This family-friendly sausage ragu has a sweet tomato and aubergine base. We've got a pretty unusual technique for cutting the aubergines that promises a rustic Italian vibe. There's a flourish of toasted seeds for the grown-ups at the end, which gives a more complex flavour. </p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the fennel seeds and cook for 2 min, then transfer them to small dish for serving&nbsp;


Tip: watch them like a hawk to make sure they toast, not burn!


Keep the pan, you'll use it later!

Tear the aubergine halves into rough pieces using your hands (alternatively chop into large chunks)


Tip: this is a rustic dish, so the aubergine doesn't have to be neat!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the tinned tomatoes, Henderson's relish and half the onion marmalade to the pan


Season&nbsp;generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;and cook for a further 5 min until a rich, ragu-like sauce has formed


Tip: taste and add more of your onion marmalade if you like it sweeter!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the cooked, drained pasta through the sausage ragu


Divide between bowls and scatter with the parsley leaves


Top the adults pasta with your toasted fennel seeds for an extra flavour dimension!


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
