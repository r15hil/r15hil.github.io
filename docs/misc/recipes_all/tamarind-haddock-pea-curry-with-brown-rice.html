<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to the pan and cook for 1 min or until they're warm and the fish is cooked through – this is your tamarind, haddock & pea curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tamarind, haddock & pea curry with the brown rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
