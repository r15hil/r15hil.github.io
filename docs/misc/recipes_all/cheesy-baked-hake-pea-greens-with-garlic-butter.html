<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften, then chop your potatoes into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your panko breadcrumbs and grated cheese in a small bowl with a pinch of salt – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are crisp – these are your mini roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and add to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), then sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb mix over the fish until totally covered

When the potatoes have 12-15 min left, put the tray[s] in the oven until the breadcrumb mixture is starting to turn golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your cheesy baked hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While everything's in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and cook for 7-8 min or until softened

Once softened, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml] </span>cold<span class="text-danger"> </span>water and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your blanched peas to the pan with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Cook for 2-3 min or until the peas are warmed through – these are your pea greens

Meanwhile, add the chopped parsley to a small bowl with the remaining chopped garlic, the softened butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your garlic butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy baked hake with the mini roast potatoes and pea greens to the side

Top the hake with the garlic butter

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the garlic butter or just add a little!</span>

Season with salt and pepper to taste

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
