<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and grate your garlic

Add the grated garlic to a bowl with your soft cheese, half of your dried oregano (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of black pepper – this is your garlic & herb mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Use a sharp knife to cut a deep pocket along the top of your chicken breast portion[s] (be careful not to cut all the way through!)

Stuff the chicken pocket[s] with the garlic & herb mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the remaining dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the dish to the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the tomatoes and garlic & herb mixture have created a sauce in the bottom of the dish – this is your garlic & herb stuffed chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel your potato[es] and sweet potato[es], then cut them into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim, then add your green beans to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Once the chicken has 10 min left, add the tray[s] to the oven and cook for 8-10 min until the beans have softened and started to brown – these are your roasted green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a knob of butter

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth – this is your sweet potato mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic & herb stuffed chicken over the sweet potato mash with the roasted green beans to the side

Spoon over the cherry tomatoes & sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
