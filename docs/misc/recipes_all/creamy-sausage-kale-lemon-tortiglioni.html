<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, reboil a kettle

Heat a very large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, squeeze your sausage meat from the skins into the pan (clean hands is the best way!), discard the skins

Break the sausage meat up into large, bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and cook for 6-7 min or until crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges, then add to the pan to soften

While the onion and sausage meat are cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and your wholegrain mustard in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[210ml] </span>[270ml]</span> boiled water

Grate your Italian hard cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your shredded kale, then add to a colander over the sink and pour boiled water all over until it's bright green and wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat is brown and crispy, reduce the heat to low

Add the sliced garlic and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tortiglioni and wilted kale to the pan with a splash of the starchy pasta water

Cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and begins to stick to the pasta – this is your creamy sausage, kale & lemon tortiglioni

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy sausage, kale & lemon tortiglioni topped with the grated cheese

Drizzle with some olive oil, season with a generous grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
