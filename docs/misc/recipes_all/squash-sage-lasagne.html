<p><strong>Description:</strong> This classic combo of squash and sage hails from the sunny plains of Emilia-Romagna and is the star of the show in this dish. Roasting the butternut squash intensifies its sweetness, which cuts through the rich, creamy, cheesy goodness of the lasagne. Just sit back and relax while the oven does its work.</p>
