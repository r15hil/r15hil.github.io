<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle


Add the soaked noodles to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Add the&nbsp;egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger">&nbsp;</span>to a bowl with a pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;and beat with a fork


Once the chicken is cooked, transfer everything to a plate and keep the pan</p><br><br>
