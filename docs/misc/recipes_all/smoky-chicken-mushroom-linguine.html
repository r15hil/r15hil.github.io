<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s], then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-6 min or until soft and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika, Dijon mustard and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl

Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl, then mix well and set aside – this is your smoky chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high

Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the mushrooms start to soften and brown slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have started to soften, add the smoky chicken to the pan

Add half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!)

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the chicken is beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>reserved starchy pasta water

Add the chicken stock to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 6-8 min or until the liquid has reduced by half and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine to the pan

Tip: Give it a good stir to release the starch in the pasta and make the sauce naturally creamy

Before the liquid has fully reduced, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your soft cheese – this is your smoky chicken & mushroom linguine</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chicken & mushroom linguine

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
