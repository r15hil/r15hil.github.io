<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse the brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, diced sweet potato and dried thyme and cook for 3-4 min further or until fragrant and starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato is fork-tender, add the brown rice and half the crème fraîche (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your creamy sweet potato & green bean rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy chicken over the creamy sweet potato & green bean rice

Dollop over the remaining crème fraîche and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
