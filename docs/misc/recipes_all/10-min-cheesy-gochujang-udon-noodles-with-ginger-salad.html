<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands along with a grind of black pepper and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your spring onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add half your ginger paste (you'll use the rest later!) to a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of sugar

Add the salad and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your ginger salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are brown, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add a large knob of butter and your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your soy sauce and the remaining ginger paste

Cook for 1 min or until the butter has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the butter has melted, add your udon noodles to the pan along with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>cold water and cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are warmed through

Tip: Gently separate the noodles with a fork!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the noodles have warmed through, add half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are evenly coated – these are your cheesy gochujang udon noodles

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the cheesy gochujang udon noodles with the sliced spring onion and remaining grated cheese

Serve the ginger salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
