<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely, then peel and finely chop your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and your garlic

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind (or chop if you don't have a pestle and mortar) to a rough powder</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork loin steak[s] with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 min on each side or until starting to brown

Once the pork has started to brown, add the sliced chestnut mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min further or until caramelised

Tip: Try not to move the mushrooms too much as this will stop them from caramelising!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pork and mushrooms have browned, add the chopped shallot, garlic and ground fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the chicken stock and cook for 2 min further until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, roughly strip your thyme leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pork is cooked through, remove from the pan and slice into thin strips on a clean board</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium-low and add your crème fraîche and half the thyme leaves (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan

Cook for 1 min further or until warmed through – this is your creamy mushroom sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the gluten free linguine with the sliced pork and pour over the creamy mushroom sauce

Garnish with a generous grind of black pepper and the remaining thyme leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
