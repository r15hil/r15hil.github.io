<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish over a medium-high heat

Add your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika and dried oregano to the dish, breaking it into small chunks and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly dice

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chicken thighs to the dish with the chopped potato, chopped pepper and onion wedges

Add your chicken stock mix, chopped tomatoes and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[330ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[430ml] </span>boiled water with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, put the dish in the oven for 40 min or until the potato is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When your bake is nearly ready, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your basil roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 40 min, remove the dish from the oven and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Leave the bake to stand, uncovered, for a final 5 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy chicken, potato & 'Nduja bake

Meanwhile slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Rub the toasted ciabatta halves with the peeled garlic – this is your garlicky ciabatta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy chicken, potato & 'Nduja bake with the garlicky ciabatta to the side

Top with the chopped basil
