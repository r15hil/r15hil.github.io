Once cooked, drain the cooked linguine and set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs, then reduce the heat to medium-high and pour in the tomato stock

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir through a generous knob of butter and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for later!)

Add the drained linguine to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your gluten free chicken linguine with tomatoes and chilli

Tip: If the sauce is too thin, return it to the heat and stir until the sauce sticks to the pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the gluten free chicken linguine with tomatoes and chilli in a bowl and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
