<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a medium-sized pot (with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened, then transfer the cooked leek to a bowl and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and dried sage with half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the cooked leek, then season with a generous grind of black pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is best!) – this is your sausage roll mix

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then add the sausage roll mix to one half of the pastry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Roll the pastry tightly over the filling and continue to roll until you have a log-shape, seal-side down

Make cuts into the log[s] widthways so there are 4 sections per person (making sure not to cut all the way through) – this is your cut sausage roll

Transfer the cut sausage roll[s] to the baking tray[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Brush the ends of the cut sausage roll with a little cold water and join the two ends together to form a circle

Gently twist each section, without tearing it from the main body, so it is filling-side up, then brush the pastry with cold water and sprinkle over your fennel seeds – this is your pork & leek sausage roll wreath

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pastry is until golden, cooked through and the edges have puffed up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the wreath is cooking, cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the remaining chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your chicken salt chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel, core and roughly chop your apple[s], discard the core[s] then peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with the chopped apple, diced onion, 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the apple has softened

Once softened, add half your red wine vinegar and half your cranberry sauce (save the rest for later!) and cook for 5-7 min or until slightly caramelised – this is your apple chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining red wine vinegar and remaining cranberry sauce to a small bowl with a small drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your cranberry dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, spoon the apple chutney into the centre of the pork & leek sausage roll wreath

Serve the chicken salt chips and salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with the cranberry dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
