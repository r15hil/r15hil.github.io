<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dice your tomato[es]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with the diced pepper, diced tomato, half the chopped garlic and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), tomato paste and chicken stock mix

Add a generous pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly softened – this is your tomato & pepper mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After the initial 10 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through the tomato & pepper mixture, reserve the pan

Re-cover the dish with the tin foil and return it to the oven for a final 15-20 min – this is your tomato & pepper rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the rice is in the oven, cover your chicken breast portions with cling film and bash with a rolling pin until it's an even thickness (not too thin!), then season with a generous pinch of salt

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the flattened chicken (cooking for 4 or more? Do this in batches!) and cook for 6-7 min on each side until browned

Drizzle over your honey and cook for a final 2-3 min or until glazed and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your honey chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining ground smoked paprika, remaining chopped garlic and the juice of half your lemon[s] in a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your smoky garlic dressing

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the honey chicken thinly on a clean board

Serve the tomato & pepper rice in a bowl topped with the sliced honey chicken, then sprinkle over the chopped parsley and drizzle over the smoky garlic dressing

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the parsley and smoky sauce, or just add a little!</span>

Garnish with a lemon wedge and enjoy!</p><br><br>
