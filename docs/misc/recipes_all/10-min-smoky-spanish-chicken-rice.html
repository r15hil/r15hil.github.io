<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Chop the green beans in half (cut them in one bunch for speed!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon with the mayo and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemon aioli

Squeeze the juice of 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/2]</span> lemon into the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky Spanish chicken & rice and drizzle the lemon aioli all over

Garnish with the lemon wedges and a grind of black pepper

Tear the parsley leaves all over and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
