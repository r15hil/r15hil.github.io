<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

<p>Peel and quarter your shallots

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>Once the shallots have caramelised, add the chopped garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further or until the garlic has softened

Once softened, add your creamy single soy to the pan with your vegetable stock mix and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the pastry rectangle[s] to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your asparagus pie lid</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the pastry has 10 min left, add the chopped asparagus and blanched peas to the pan with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] and a very generous grind of black pepper

Cook for 8-9 min or until the asparagus is tender with a slight bite – this is your asparagus & pea pie filling

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the asparagus & pea pie filling with the roasties to the side

Top the pie filling with the asparagus pie lid and garnish with the lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
