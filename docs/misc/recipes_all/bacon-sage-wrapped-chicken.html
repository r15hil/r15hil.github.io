<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Place your hand flat on the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Carefully, slice the chicken in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Place a couple of sage leaves over each piece of chicken, then wrap each piece of chicken in 2 rashers of bacon


Add the wrapped chicken to the tray with the mushrooms


Put the tray directly under the grill and cook for 10-15 min or until the bacon has cooked and crisped and the chicken is cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, drain the potatoes and leave them in a colander, then return the pot to a medium-low heat with a large knob of butter


Add the remaining&nbsp;chopped sage and cook for 1 min, then add the potatoes, a big splash of milk and salt and pepper


Mash until smooth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the cooked chicken and mushrooms from the grill&nbsp;


Transfer the chicken to a chopping board to rest a little&nbsp;


Sieve the mushrooms and collected juices into a small pan


Add the pan to a low heat and stir in the clotted cream until melted, then season with pepper - this is your pan sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken over the mash with the mushrooms dotted around and the pan sauce spooned over


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
