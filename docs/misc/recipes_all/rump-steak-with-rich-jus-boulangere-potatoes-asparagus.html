<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven and start your boulangère potatoes 


Set the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7.


Boil a kettle.


Peel, finely slice the potatoes and 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> brown onion. Finely chop the remaining onion for your sauce.


Dissolve the Knorr beef stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>boiled water. 


Strip the thyme leaves from their stalks and chop them finely. Discard the stalks.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Finish preparing your boulangère


Layer the sliced onion and potatoes in an oven-proof dish, approx 25cmx15cm (save the best-looking potato slices for the top layer). Sprinkle every layer with a pinch of salt and pepper and a little chopped thyme (save some thyme for the sauce in step 3).


Pour 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> of the beef stock (save the rest for later) and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> milk over the potatoes. Dot the top layer with 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter.


Place the dish in the oven for 30-35 minutes or until fork-tender and golden brown – these are your boulangère potatoes.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cook the pancetta and chopped onion for the jus


Whilst the boulangère potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat.


Once the pan’s hot, add the pancetta lardons and cook for 5 minutes or until starting to crisp.


Once crisp, add the chopped onion and remaining thyme. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until the onion has softened and then transfer to a plate.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Prepare your steak for frying 


Give the pan a quick wipe and return it to a high heat. 


Pat the rump steaks dry with kitchen towel, rub them with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Fry the steaks


Once the pan is very hot, add the steaks.


For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. For medium, cook for 3-4 minutes. For rare, cook for 2 minutes maximum on each side.


Tip: To get that restaurant look and caramelised flavour, resist the temptation to move the steaks around in the pan – it stops them from browning nicely.


Once cooked, transfer the steaks to a chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest in a warm place. Use the same pan for step 6.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cook the rich jus


Whilst the steaks are resting, add the cooked pancetta and chopped onion to the pan with the balsamic vinegar, onion marmalade and remaining beef stock.


Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes or until thickened so it coats the back of a wooden spoon and has a rich flavour.


Season with pepper and stir in a knob of butter – this is your rich jus.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cook the asparagus


Whilst your sauce is reducing, re-boil the kettle.


Pour the boiling water into a pan over a high heat. Add a pinch of salt.


Once the water comes back to the boil, add the asparagus and cook for 4 minutes or until tender, then drain.


Tip: Adding salt to the water keeps your asparagus bright green.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Plate up each steak with the boulangère potatoes and asparagus spears, with the rich jus to the side.


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
