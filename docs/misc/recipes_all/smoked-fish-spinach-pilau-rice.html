<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat, then boil half a kettle

Squeeze your pouch[es] of the cooked white long grain rice, making sure to separate the grains

Once hot, remove the pan off the heat and add your ginger & garlic paste and cooked white long grain rice to the pan and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the pan back to the heat and sprinkle your ground turmeric and vegetable stock mix into the pan

Pour in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water and mix it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach and half your chilli flakes to the pan (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up, then sit your smoked basa fillet[s] over the rice and cook, covered, for an initial 4-5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 4-5 min, break the basa into chunks in the pan with a wooden spoon, stir it through the rice and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, add the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and stir it all together until fully combined – this is your smoked basa & spinach pilau rice

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa & spinach pilau rice with the sliced spring onion sprinkled over the top

Garnish with the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lemon wedge

Season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
