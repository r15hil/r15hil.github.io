<h4>Step 1</h4>

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is ready, wash and pat your salad dry with kitchen paper

Add half of the salad (you'll use the rest later!) to the pesto dressing with the tomato wedges and give it a good mix up – this is your pesto dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, fill the warmed ciabatta halves with the seasoned chicken, pesto mayo and the remaining salad – this is your chicken & pesto ciabatta

Serve the pesto dressed salad and chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
