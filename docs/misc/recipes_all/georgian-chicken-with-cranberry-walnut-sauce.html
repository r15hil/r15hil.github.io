<h4>Step 1</h4>

Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grind the walnuts in a pestle and mortar to form a smooth paste


Tip: if you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop the walnuts very finely


Peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Dissolve&nbsp;1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> chicken stock cube in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a plate &amp; return the pan &amp;&nbsp;oil (if there's none left, add a splash more!) to a medium heat


Once hot, add the sliced shallot, fenugreek, ground&nbsp;coriander&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;paprika&nbsp;&amp; cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant


Once fragrant, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[</span><span style="color: #e86754;">2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms&nbsp;&ndash; this is your roux&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the cranberries and gradually stir in the chicken stock and cook for 3-4 min or until it starts to thicken&nbsp;


Once thickened, add the&nbsp;clotted cream, most of the crushed walnuts (<span class="text-highlight">save some</span> for garnish)&nbsp;and season with a pinch of black pepper&nbsp;


If the sauce is looking a little dry, add a splash of water&nbsp;


Return the chicken to the pan for 1-2 min or until warmed through

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, once the potatoes are almost cooked, add the green beans&nbsp;<span class="text-highlight">and</span> cook for 2-3 min further or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the green beans have a slight bite&nbsp;


Drain the potatoes &amp; beans and add a knob of butter&nbsp;to the pot&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Pick the parsley leaves from the stalks&nbsp;


Slice the chicken and serve it over the walnut &amp; cranberry sauce with the green beans and potatoes to the side


Garnish with the parsley leaves and remaining crushed walnuts


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
