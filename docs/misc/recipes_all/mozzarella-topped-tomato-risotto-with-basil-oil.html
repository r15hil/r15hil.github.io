<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grind the chopped basil with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 3-4 tbsp olive oil or enough to loosen and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with salt and olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is nearly cooked, stir in your red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for a further 2 min – this is your tomato risotto

Season the tomato risotto with salt and pepper

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato risotto in bowls

Tear the mozzarella in half and nestle into the tomato risotto so that it melts nicely

Drizzle the basil oil over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
