<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and halved green beans to the pan with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5 min

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your tomato[es]

Once the chicken has had 5 min, add half of the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and the chopped tomato and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your ground smoked paprika, warmed rice and chicken stock to the pan and cook for a further 3 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky Spanish-style chicken & rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, cut your lemon[s] into wedges and add a squeeze of lemon juice into the pan and give everything a good mix up

Combine a squeeze of lemon juice with your mayo, the remaining grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your lemon aioli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky Spanish-style chicken & rice and drizzle the lemon aioli all over

Garnish with a lemon wedge and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
