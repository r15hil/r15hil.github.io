<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and shallot[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your ginger

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a large bowl with half the grated ginger, half the chopped garlic and half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and mix everything together

Divide the pork mixture and shape into 5 small meatballs per person – these are your pork balls</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork balls to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook covered for 6 min, until your pork is cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork balls are cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove your pineapple from the can (save the juice!) and chop roughly

Add your cornflour to a bowl with the reserved pineapple juice

Add your tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, chilli relish and remaining soy sauce and mix until smooth – this is your sweet & sour sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pork balls are cooked through and browned, transfer to a plate and set aside, carefully wipe any excess hot oil from the pan using kitchen paper

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the remaining grated ginger, chopped garlic and chopped shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add the sweet & sour sauce and chopped pineapple and cook for 2-3 min further or until reduced to a syrup-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add your blanched peas to the pot and cook for a further 2 min

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green pea rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the green pea rice and top with the sweet & sour pork balls

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
