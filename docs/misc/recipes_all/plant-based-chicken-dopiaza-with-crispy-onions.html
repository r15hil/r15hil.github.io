<p><strong>Description:</strong> Legend has it, the dopiaza was born from a happy accident, when a chef added too many onions to a dish. To make your own, you'll prepare onion three ways: blitzed into a rich paste, cut into wedges and simmered with plant-based chicken and tomato, and as a crispy topping.</p>
