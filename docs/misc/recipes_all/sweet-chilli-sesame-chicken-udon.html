<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste with your diced chicken breast and cook for 6 min or until the chicken starts to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce, red chilli relish and toasted sesame oil in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli & sesame sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has wilted, add the sweet chilli & sesame sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the noodles are coated and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet chilli & sesame chicken udon</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet chilli & sesame chicken udon in a bowl

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion and your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
