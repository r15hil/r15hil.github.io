Carefully remove the skins from the roasted garlic cloves (beware, they will be hot!)

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Remove the pot from the heat and blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender

Tip: For the smoothest results, use a food processor!

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy cauliflower soup

Tip: Add a splash of water if you think the soup is a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy cauliflower soup in bowls, garnished with the reserved cauliflower florets, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper
