<p><strong>Description:</strong> The literal term ‘taco’ refers to a hole that needs to be filled. Originally it was a Mexican word used to describe padding that would be used to plug an empty space. Nowadays, tacos are known the-world-over as delicious spiced meat, which is scooped up in corn or wholemeal shells and served with salsa.</p>
