<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs, then set aside to drain fully

<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once starting to brown, add the carrot batons and chopped pepper to the pan with the grated ginger, chopped garlic and your toasted sesame oil and cook for a further 3-4 min or until fragrant and starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix, gochujang paste and soy sauce in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water – this is your spiced stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the spiced stock and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar to the pan with a grind of pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the chicken is cooked, add the spinach to the pan and cook for a final 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your gochujang chicken breast stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the gochujang chicken breast stew and sticky rice in a separate bowl

Garnish the stew with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
