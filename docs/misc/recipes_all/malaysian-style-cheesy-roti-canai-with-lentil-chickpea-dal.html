<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, then chop in half

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

Drain and rinse your chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste, curry powder, halved lemongrass, rinsed lentils and drained chickpeas to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are tender – this is your lentil & chickpea dal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil half a kettle

Slice your cucumber into discs

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced cucumber and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with your rice vinegar, a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add 1 roti per person to a baking tray (or two!) and top with the grated cheese, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!)

Place the remaining roti on top so you end up with roti sandwich

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until the cheese is melted – this is your Malaysian-style cheesy roti canai</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the Malaysian-style cheesy roti canai into quarters

Serve the lentil & chickpea dal (discard the lemongrass!) with the quartered Malaysian-style cheesy roti canai and quick-pickled chilli cucumber to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
