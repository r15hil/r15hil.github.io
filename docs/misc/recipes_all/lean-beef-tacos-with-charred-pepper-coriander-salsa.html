<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Chop your tomato[es] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until charred and tender

Once done, transfer to a bowl and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat and once hot, add your lean beef mince with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander and a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the tomato stock to the pan with a pinch of sugar

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has reduced and the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lean beef taco mix

Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the lean beef taco mix equally between each warmed tortilla and top with the charred pepper & parsley salsa

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the salsa and serve the reserved chopped tomato in the tacos with the pepper strips to the side!</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
