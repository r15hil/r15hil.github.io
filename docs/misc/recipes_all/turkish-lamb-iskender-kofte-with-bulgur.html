<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve the tomato paste and 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>Knorr chicken stock cube (save the rest for later!) in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Once the bulgur has toasted, add the stock to the pan and reduce the heat to very low

Cook, covered, for 15 min or until all of the water has been absorbed and the bulgur is cooked through – this is your tomato bulgur</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the lamb mince to a bowl with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the sumac (save the rest for later), ground cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until the spices are fully mixed in

Divide the lamb mixture into 10 <span class="text-danger">[20]</span>, shape them into meatballs and flatten them slightly

Tip: Use wet hands to shape the balls!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a dry, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb kofte and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the lamb is cooking, halve the cherry tomatoes

Dissolve the remaining Knorr chicken stock cube in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the lamb kofte are done, transfer them to a plate and set them aside for later

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to break down

Add the chicken stock a pinch of sugar and the ground paprika and cook for 2-3 min further or until starting to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, return the lamb kofte to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fully coated in the sauce – these are your lamb iskender kofte</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the natural yoghurt on your plates, top with the lamb iskender kofte and sprinkle over the remaining sumac

Serve the tomato bulgur and pickled red cabbage to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
