<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, wash and shred your lettuce finely, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Top, tail, peel, then grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Add the shredded lettuce, grated carrot and sliced spring onion to a large mixing bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber into discs

Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks

Cut half of your red chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into rounds (save the rest for later!)

Add the cucumber matchsticks and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with the lettuce, carrot and spring onion – this is your crunchy salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min on each side, or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Combine your peanut butter and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a bowl and mix well until you have a smooth paste

Add your soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and mix well to combine – this is your peanut dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once warmed through, reduce the heat to medium-low and sprinkle your five-spice mix over the meat-free chick'n

Give everything a good mix up until the meat-free chick'n is evenly coated in the spice and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked meat-free chick'n to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Once shredded, season the pulled meat-free chick'n with a pinch of salt – this is your bang bang meat-free chick'n

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to the crunchy salad – this is your crunchy rice salad

Toss the crunchy rice salad in a drizzle of olive oil and season with a crack of black pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bang bang meat-free chick'n over the crunchy rice salad and drizzle the peanut dressing all over – this is your bang bang meat-free chick'n with crunchy rice salad

Garnish with a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
