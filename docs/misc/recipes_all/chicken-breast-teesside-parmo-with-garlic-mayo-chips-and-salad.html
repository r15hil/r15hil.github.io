<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

Grate your cheddar cheese finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cover the chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness

Add a handful of flour to a plate, a splash of vegetable oil to a shallow bowl and your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate

Season the flattened chicken with a generous pinch of salt, coat them in flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the oil and finally press them into the panko breadcrumbs firmly or until evenly coated all over – this is your breaded chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, melt a generous knob of butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 3-4 min or until a smooth, very thick sauce remains, then set aside – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chips are ready, transfer the baking tray with the chips to the bottom shelf of the oven

Preheat the grill to high

Transfer the crispy chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and top with the béchamel sauce, then the grated cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 3-5 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – this is your Teesside parmo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the chopped tomato and salad in a bowl with half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a little drizzle of olive oil – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), your mayo and the remaining white wine vinegar in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Teesside parmo with the salad, chips and garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
