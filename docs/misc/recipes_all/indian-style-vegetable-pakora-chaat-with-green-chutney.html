<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 10 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Top, tail, peel and grate the carrots

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely into rounds

Drain and rinse the chickpeas and set them aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the sliced red onion, grated carrot and half the green chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a large bowl

Add the gram flour with half the curry powder (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Massage the mixture for 30 secs, squeezing the onion and carrot together to form a thick mixture

Tip: Squeezing the mix will release the natural moisture in the carrot and onion!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine has had 10 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>from the oven

Scoop out 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> handfuls of the mixture, shape into rough bhaji shapes and add to the other side of the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your vegetable pakoras

Drizzle the pakoras with a little vegetable oil

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span> to the oven for 20-25 min further or until the pakora are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained chickpeas and remaining curry powder and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and cook for 5-6 min further or until thickened – this is your chickpea curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the chickpeas are cooking, strip the mint leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Add the mint leaves to a food processor

Tear in the coriander roughly, including the stalks

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your green chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, stir the cooked aubergine through the chickpea curry – this is your aubergine chana masala

Slice the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the aubergine chana masala and top with the vegetable pakoras – this is your Indian-style vegetable pakora chaat

Drizzle over the natural yoghurt, tamarind paste and green chutney

Garnish with the crispy onions, a lemon wedge and remaining green chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
