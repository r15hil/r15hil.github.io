<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your hot dog sausage[s] to one side of a tin foil-lined-baking tray (or two!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min or until the sausage[s] are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber finely

Add half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with a small pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>warm water

Add the sliced cucumber to the bowl and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot with 15g <span class="text-purple">[25g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), the remaining cider vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Stir everything together until it combines and becomes a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and most of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!) in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of cold water – this is your ranch-style chive mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut a slit into the top of the hot dog bun[s]

Remove the tray[s] with the sausage[s] from the oven

Add the cut hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the hot dog bun[s] are warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the hot dog bun with a hot dog and some of the quick-pickled cucumber, then top with the buffalo sauce, the chopped chives and crumble your feta on top

Serve the chips, remaining quick-pickled cucumber and lettuce wedges to the side

Spoon the ranch-style chive mayo on top of the wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
