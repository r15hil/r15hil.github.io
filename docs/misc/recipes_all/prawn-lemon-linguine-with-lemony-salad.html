<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the linguine is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain, then add your king prawns and cook for 3-4 min

Add your ground smoked paprika, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your vegetable stock mix and 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

Roughly chop your cherry tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine a squeeze of lemon juice with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your zingy dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with the chopped cherry tomatoes

Add the zingy dressing and toss – this is your zingy salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add a generous knob of butter and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Tip: Add more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon[s] and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your king prawn & lemon linguine

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the king prawn & lemon linguine topped with your grated Italian hard cheese and the zingy salad to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
