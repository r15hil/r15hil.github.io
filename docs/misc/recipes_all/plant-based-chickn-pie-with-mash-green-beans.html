<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Combine 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water in a measuring jug with your Marmite and vegetable stock mix – this is your Marmite stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once softened, add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour with the chopped garlic and your dried thyme and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the Marmite stock with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your pie mix

Meanwhile, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is large enough to cover an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Shred your meat-free chick'n using two forks, then add to the pie mix and stir it all together

Transfer the pie mix to an oven-proof dish (or two!)

Top the pie mix with the rolled pastry and crimp round the edge with a fork

Score a cross in the middle of the pastry and put it in the oven for 15-18 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your plant-based chick’n pie</p><br><br>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
