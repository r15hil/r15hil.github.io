<h4>Step 1</h4>

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s], then peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped aubergine to an oven-proof dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil and put the dish in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until softened and starting to colour

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skins on) as thinly as you can

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>of boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water, then add them to the pan with the coconut stock

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20-25 min, remove the roasted aubergine from the oven and add the lentil mixture to the dish

Give everything a good mix up, then carefully layer the softened sliced potatoes on top (they will be hot!)

Return the dish to the oven for 10 min further or until everything's bubbling and the potatoes are brown and crispy – this is your Thai-style curry aubergine pie

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Add the halved green beans to a pot of boiled water and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite, then drain and return to the pot

Add your soy sauce, peanut butter and a small splash of boiled water

Give the beans a good mix up until the peanut butter has loosened – these are your nutty beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style curry aubergine pie with the nutty beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
