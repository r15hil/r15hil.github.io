<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the chorizo is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<p>Once fragrant, add the spicy harissa stock and drained butter beans to the pan

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your spicy chorizo, harissa & butter bean stew

Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
