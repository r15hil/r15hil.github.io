<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, bash your cardamom pods and remove the seeds from the shells

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a low heat

Once hot, add your fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!), cardamom seeds and most of the cumin seeds (save some for later!)

Toast for 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the spices are toasting, add your lamb mince, panko breadcrumbs and remaining cumin seeds to a bowl

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the lamb mince and shape into 4 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Transfer the toasted spices to a pestle & mortar and return the pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the meatballs are cooking, bash the spices into a fine powder in the pestle & mortar

Add most of your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your Kashmiri-style spice blend</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges

Once the meatballs have browned, add a generous knob of butter to the pan with the sliced onion, Kashmiri-style spice blend and chicken stock mix and cook for 5-6 min or until the onion has softened

Once softened, add the tomato wedges and cook for 3-4 min further or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the meatballs are cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your natural yoghurt with most of the chopped coriander

Set aside for 2 min until the yoghurt has warmed through – this is your Kashmiri-style lamb meatball curry

Sprinkle the remaining turmeric over the basmati rice (don't mix it!) and set aside for 2 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>After 2 min, mix the turmeric through the basmati rice – this is your turmeric stained rice

Serve the Kashmiri-style lamb meatball curry with the turmeric stained rice to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
