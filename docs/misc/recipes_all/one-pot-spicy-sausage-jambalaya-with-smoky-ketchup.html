<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat is beginning to brown, add your dried thyme with most of your ground smoked paprika (save a pinch for later!)

Add your roasted garlic paste and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water with your chopped tomatoes, chicken stock mix, chopped peppers and basmati rice and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the rice is cooked and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy jambalaya</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your smoked salt and the remaining ground smoked paprika in a small bowl with your tomato ketchup

Add a pinch of sugar and pepper with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water – this is your smoky ketchup

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and fluff the spicy jambalaya with a fork

Add your blanched peas with a small knob of butter and give everything a good mix up – this is your spicy sausage jambalaya</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy sausage jambalaya and drizzle over the smoky ketchup

Dig in!</p><br><br>
