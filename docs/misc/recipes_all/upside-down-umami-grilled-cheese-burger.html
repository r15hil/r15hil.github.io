<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil and a small knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a splash of cold water, then cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the beef mince and Henderson's relish in a medium bowl with the Marmite and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>and shape them into thin patties (approx 1cm thick)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has caramelised, add half the miso paste (you'll use the rest later!) and stir it all together

Transfer the onion to a bowl (reserve the pan!) – this is your miso onion

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the patties and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your umami patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the patties are cooking, slice the cheddar cheese finely

Combine the mayo and the remaining miso paste in a small bowl with half the white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a small splash of water – this is your miso mayo

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice the brioche buns in half

Add half the sliced cheese onto each brioche base then top with the miso onion and umami patty (reserve the pan!)

Flip the brioche lid upside down and add it onto the patty – this is your upside down umami cheeseburger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the upside down umami cheeseburgers to the pan and press them down firmly with a spatula

Cook for 2 min on each side or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is toasted – this is your upside down umami grilled cheese burger</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the upside down umami grilled cheese burger in half and serve with the fries and miso mayo to the side

Serve the baby leaf salad to the side with the remaining white wine vinegar and a little drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
