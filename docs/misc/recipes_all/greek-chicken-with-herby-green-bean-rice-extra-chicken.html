Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add the remaining Mediterranean-style seasoning, half of your roasted garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!), your white long grain rice, chopped green beans and chicken stock mix with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your seasoned chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once your rice has cooked, remove from the heat and add your spinach

Put the lid back on and set aside for 3 min or until the spinach has started to wilt

Once wilted, give everything a good mix up – this is your herby green bean rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Combine your mayo and the remaining roasted garlic paste in a small bowl with a splash of cold water – this is your roasted garlic mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the Greek chicken

Serve the sliced chicken on top of the herby green bean rice

Drizzle over the roasted garlic mayo

Garnish with the chopped parsley and your ground sumac

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
