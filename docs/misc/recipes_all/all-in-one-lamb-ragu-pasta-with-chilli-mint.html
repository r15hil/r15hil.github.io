<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and roughly chop your red onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice at an angle

Crush your garlic clove[s] open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins</p><br><br>

<p>Add your lamb mince to the dish, breaking it up into rough, large chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped red onion to the dish with the sliced carrot, crushed garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, beef stock mix and 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water

Add your balsamic vinegar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your spicy lamb ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until everything's beginning to soften

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spicy lamb ragù has been cooking for 20 min, remove the dish from the oven, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir

Add your conchiglie and mix it all together so that the pasta is nestled into the sauce

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 25 min or until the pasta is cooked through – this is your spicy lamb ragù pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy lamb ragù pasta topped with your grated Italian hard cheese

Tear your mint leaves over the top
