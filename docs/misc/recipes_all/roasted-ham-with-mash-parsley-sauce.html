<h4>Step 4</h4>

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle with the chopped garlic, a few small knobs of butter and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> water


Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> sealed parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and add to a baking tray


Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the greens are tender</p><br><br>
