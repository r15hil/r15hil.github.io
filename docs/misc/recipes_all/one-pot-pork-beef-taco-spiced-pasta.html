Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<p>Once fragrant, add your conchiglie with your beef stock mix and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 11-14 min, or until the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite – this is your taco-spiced pasta

Tip: Stir occasionally to stop it from sticking!</p><br><br>

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of sugar in a bowl

Add the sliced onion, chopped tomato and remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and give it a good mix up – this is your green chilli salsa</p><br><br>
