<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and the onion wedges to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6 min or until the onion is slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your tomato[es] roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your mayo and roasted garlic paste in a bowl with half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and a grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted garlic aioli</p><br><br>

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the tomato is slightly softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & tomato relish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top each warmed tortilla with the shredded lettuce and the chicken & tomato relish
