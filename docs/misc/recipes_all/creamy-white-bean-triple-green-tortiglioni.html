<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pumpkin seeds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, transfer them to a small bowl, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix with your soft cheese in 180ml<span class="text-purple"> [230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[280ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy stock

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will finish cooking in the sauce later!

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
