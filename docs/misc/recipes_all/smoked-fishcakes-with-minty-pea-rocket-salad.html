<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your smoked basa fillet[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, flake the cooked smoked basa roughly with a fork and reserve the tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim then slice your spring onions finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with half the chopped mint, half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your minty mayo

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Run the drained potatoes under cold running water until they're cool enough to handle, then return them to the pot, add a knob of butter and crush gently

Add the flaked smoked basa and sliced spring onion, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix gently

Divide the mix then shape them into 2 fishcakes per person

Press the fishcakes into your panko breadcrumbs until evenly coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the coated fishcakes to the reserved tray with a drizzle of olive oil (line the tray with fresh tin foil)

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – these are your smoked basa fishcakes

Wash your salad then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the fishcakes are cooking, add your blanched peas to a pot of boiled water and cook for 2-3 min or until tender, then drain

Combine the remaining white wine vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Add the drained peas, remaining chopped mint and salad to the dressing, then give everything a good mix up – this is your pea salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa fishcakes with the pea salad to the side

Drizzle the minty mayo over the fishcakes

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
