<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your tomato paste and soy sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s]

Dice the remaining red onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add your ground cumin and ground smoked paprika to the pan with the chopped garlic and sliced onion

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for for 30 secs or until aromatic

Once aromatic, add the tomato stock, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Once the chicken is ready, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the the pulled chicken to the pan with the grated cheese and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy chicken mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide the cheesy chicken mix between your tortillas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Fold each filled tortilla over so you're left with 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>half moon-shaped sandwiches per person and add to a baking tray (or 2!)

Place another baking tray on top of the filled tortillas to weigh them down

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven and cook for 15 min or until the tortillas are slightly browned – these are your smoky chicken quesadillas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the quesadillas are cooking, dice your tomato[es]

Add the diced tomato and diced onion to a small bowl with half your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your tomato salsa

Add your mayo to a small bowl with the remaining white wine vinegar and stir it all together – this is your zingy mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the smoky chicken quesadillas with the zingy mayo and tomato salsa

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
