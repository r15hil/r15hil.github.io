<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chips and carrot batons to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chips have had 20 min, pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub them with a little vegetable oil and season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned steak[s] and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until they're browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the steaks are cooked, add half the maple mustard glaze (save the rest for garnish!) and cook for 2-3 min further or until thick and sticky – these are your sticky mustard glazed pork chops</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and halved cherry tomatoes to the dressing and give it a good mix up – this is your salad

Once done, transfer the sticky mustard glazed pork chops to a clean board and slice finely into strips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced sticky mustard glazed pork chops with the chips, roasted carrots and salad to the side

Spoon any remaining maple mustard glaze from the pan over the pork and carrots

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
