<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat, once hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for an initial 4-5 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the sriracha, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), Henderson's Relish and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your buffalo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Grate the cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the tomato paste to a bowl with the remaining chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is golden, add the buffalo sauce to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 2 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your buffalo chicken

Remove the heated tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and add the pizza bases

Divide the tomato sauce between the pizza bases and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top the pizza bases with the buffalo chicken, torn mozzarella and grated cheese

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your spicy buffalo chicken breast pizzas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are in the oven, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Combine the mayo, white wine vinegar and dried oregano in a small bowl – this is your herby sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the spicy buffalo chicken breast pizzas from the oven and drizzle the herby sauce over the top

Sprinkle the sliced spring onion on top and dig in

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
