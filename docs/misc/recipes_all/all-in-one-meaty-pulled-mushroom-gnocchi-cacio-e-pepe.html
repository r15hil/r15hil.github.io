<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a large oven-proof dish (or two!)

Add your Fable pulled mushrooms to one side of the dish[es]

Coat your gnocchi in a little olive oil and add it to the other side of the dish[es]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Put the dish[es] in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until the gnocchi is crispy and golden

Tip: Check your Fable pulled mushrooms and gnocchi half way through and give them a stir for even crispiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once everything's been cooking for 25-30 min, boil a kettle

Cut your tomato[es] in half

Add the tomato halves, cut-side up, to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt

Drizzle over half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – these are your roasted balsamic tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi and Fable pulled mushrooms are almost done, mix your grated Italian hard cheese and cornflour in a jug

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water, your vegetable stock mix, soft cheese and cracked black pepper – this is your cacio e pepe sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the gnocchi & Fable pulled mushroom dish[es] from the oven, pour over the cacio e pepe sauce and give everything a good mix up

Return the dish[es] to the oven for 8-10 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the cheese has melted – this is your all-in-one Fable pulled mushroom & gnocchi cacio e pepe</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the all-in-one Fable pulled mushroom & gnocchi cacio e pepe with the salad and the roasted balsamic tomatoes to the side

Drizzle the reserved balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil over the salad
