<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your butternut squash cubes to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Crush your garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins

Add the tomato wedges and crushed garlic to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix

Add your basmati rice with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until all the water has absorbed, the squash is fork-tender and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and set aside for 5 min to steam (keep the lid on!) – this is your baked butternut squash biryani

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, fluff the baked butternut squash biryani with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Top with a dollop of your cultured coconut, the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and crispy onions

Tip: Watch out for the ginger halves, cardamom pods and bay leaf[ves] and discard!
