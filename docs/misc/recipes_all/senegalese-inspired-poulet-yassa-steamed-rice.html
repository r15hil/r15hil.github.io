<p><strong>Description:</strong> The inspiration for this recipe comes from Poulet Yassa, a chicken dish from the Casamance region of Southern Senegal. You'll marinate chicken and onions in lots of citrus (ideally overnight if you can!), before creating a lemony-Dijon mustard sauce with caramelised onions and peppers to serve.

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated onion (remove the chicken thighs and set aside for later!) with the bay leaves, sliced yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and a generous pinch of salt and sugar<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 10-12 min or until golden brown and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the veg is caramelising, drizzle a baking tray with vegetable oil

Pat the marinated chicken thighs dry and season generously on both sides with salt

Add to the baking tray, skin side up, drizzle with vegetable oil and grill for 5-6 min or until the skin is golden brown then remove from the oven (you'll finish cooking these in the pan later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low then add the browned chicken thighs into the pan (skin side up) and cook for a further 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) â€“ this is your poulet yassa</p><br><br>
