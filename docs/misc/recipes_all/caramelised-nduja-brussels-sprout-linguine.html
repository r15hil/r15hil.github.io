<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp [3 tbsp] [4 tbsp] olive oil – this is your dressing

Once the onion and garlic has softened, add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up until the flour has dissolved, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sprouts are cooking, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 6-7 min (this will finish cooking in the sauce later!)

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Return the drained linguine to the pot and boil a little water in a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sprouts have softened, add your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go until the water has evaporated

Once evaporated, add your honey to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until caramelised – these are your caramelised 'Nduja Brussels sprouts

Tip: Reduce the heat to medium if the sprouts look like they're burning!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the sprouts are caramelising, return the drained linguine to a medium heat with the cooked onion & garlic, clotted cream and reserved starchy pasta water

Add half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and chicken stock mix and stir it all together for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened and the pasta is fully coated – this is your velvety linguine

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the velvety linguine in a bowl topped with the caramelised 'Nduja Brussels sprouts

Serve the salad in a separate bowl with the dressing drizzled over and the remaining grated Italian hard cheese sprinkled on top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
