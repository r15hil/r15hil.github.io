<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your garlic cloves to a piece of tin foil with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil, then scrunch the foil around the garlic to form a tightly sealed parcel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs

Add the courgette discs to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the garlic parcel to the other side of the tray and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the garlic has softened – this is your roasted garlic and roasted courgette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast strips with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and roasted garlic paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy garlic stock

Once the chicken has browned, add the creamy garlic stock to the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your wholewheat tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and roughly chop

Carefully squeeze roasted garlic out of the skins and mash with a fork, discard the skins</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken back to the pan with the mashed roasted garlic, drained tortiglioni, roasted courgette, chopped spinach and a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted garlic & pulled chicken tortiglioni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted garlic & pulled chicken tortiglioni

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
