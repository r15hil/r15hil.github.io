<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and season them with salt and pepper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite sized pieces!), then once the pan is hot, add the haddock bites and cook for 5 min, turning once halfway, until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked haddock bites to a plate and reserve the pan

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine and set aside until later</p><br><br>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat (if it's looking a little dry, add a drizzle of olive oil)

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add the halved cherry tomatoes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop your chives finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs, then pour in the tomato stock

Cook for 5-7 min or until reduced to a pasta sauce-like consistency

Remove from the heat and stir through a generous knob of butter with half of the chopped chives and a good grind of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine and haddock bites to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your haddock linguine with tomatoes & chilli

Tip: If the sauce is too thin, return it to the heat and stir until the sauce sticks to the pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the haddock linguine with tomatoes & chilli and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
