<p><strong>Description:</strong> This super quick beef noodle soup is inspired by ‘Pho’ (pronounced ‘fer’), which is a traditional Vietnamese street dish of nourishing stock and rice noodles. Our ‘faux’ version still delivers a deep flavoured stock with the aid of star anise and a few salty sweet extras - but can be knocked out in minutes.</p>
