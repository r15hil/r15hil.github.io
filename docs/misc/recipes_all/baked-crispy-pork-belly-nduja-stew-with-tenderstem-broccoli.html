<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Score the fatty side of your pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a generous pinch of salt and rub it into the criss-cross pattern

Add the scored pork belly, fat-side down, to the dish and cook for 2 min or until the fat is golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes in half, then peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and cut into quarters

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into quarters lengthways, then into batons

Once golden, transfer the golden pork belly to a plate and reduce the heat to medium</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped leek to the dish with the shallot quarters, carrot batons and halved potatoes

Add your roasted garlic paste, Chinese rice wine, fennel seeds, 300ml <span class="text-purple">[350ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[510ml]</span> boiled water, your chicken stock mix and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tear your 'Nduja into the dish (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, return the golden pork belly to the dish, skin-side up

Put the dish in the oven and cook, uncovered, for an initial 50 min – this is your pork belly stew

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the stew has had 50 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir in your crème fraiche, keeping the pork belly skin-side up, then return the dish to the oven for 7-8 min or until thick and saucy and the pork belly is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baked spicy pork belly & 'Nduja stew

Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until beginning to crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Remove the crispy pork belly from the dish and slice into 3<span class="text-danger"> </span>slices per person on a clean board

To serve, top the stew with the pork belly slices with the Tenderstem broccoli to the side

Dig in!</p><br><br>
