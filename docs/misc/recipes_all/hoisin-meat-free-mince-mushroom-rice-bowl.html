<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the outer leaves from the lettuce and set aside, then shred the inner core

Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free mince has started to brown, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, roughly tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan

Add your hoisin sauce, soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>water and cook for 2-3 min further or until everything is combined and the mushrooms have started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have softened, stir through the shredded lettuce and toasted sesame seeds – this is your hoisin meat-free mince & mushrooms</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the lettuce leaves to the side of a bowl and top with the cooked brown rice and hoisin meat-free mince & mushrooms

Garnish with your crispy onions and chilli rounds (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Tip: Make loaded lettuce cups by adding filling to the lettuce leaves!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
