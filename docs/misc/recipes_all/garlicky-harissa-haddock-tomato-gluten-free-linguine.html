<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once slightly opaque, add the drained linguine to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper, the harissa stock, reserved starchy pasta water and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mix up and increase the heat to high, then cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has slightly reduced and the fish is beginning to break up – this is your garlicky harissa haddock & tomato gluten free linguine

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<p>Serve the garlicky harissa haddock & tomato gluten free linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
