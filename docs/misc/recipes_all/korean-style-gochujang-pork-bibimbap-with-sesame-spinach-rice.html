<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pork is coated, push the gochujang pork to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s] onto the other side

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>

<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your toasted sesame oil and spinach to the pot with the cooked rice with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the spinach starts to wilt – this is your spinach rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the gochujang pork with the spinach rice and sliced cucumber to the side and top with the fried egg[s] – this is your Korean-style gochujang pork bibimbap

Drizzle over the remaining gochujang ketchup and garnish with your toasted sesame seeds
