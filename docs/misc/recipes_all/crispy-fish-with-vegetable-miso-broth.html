<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot, (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min

Add 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water with your miso paste, vegetable stock mix and soy sauce and give everything a good mix until fully combined

Reduce the heat to low – this is your miso broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your ground smoked paprika, cornflour and a pinch of salt on a plate

Cut your basa fillet[s] in half, add them to the cornflour mix and turn them until evenly coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the wholewheat noodles, pour over the vegetable miso broth and top with the crispy basa

Garnish with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
