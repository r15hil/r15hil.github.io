<p><strong>Description:</strong> We've taken influence from the classic tapas dish 'gambas pil pil' (prawns with chilli and garlic) and made a meal of it, literally. You will serve juicy spicy, garlicky tomato king prawns, spiced with chilli flakes and smoky paprika over a sunny coloured rice with green peppers and red onion. Drizzled with aioli (garlic mayonnaise). HOLA!</p>

Add the turmeric,&nbsp;rice&nbsp;and remaining garlic to the softened onion and pepper and stir to coat the grains in oil and spice&nbsp;
