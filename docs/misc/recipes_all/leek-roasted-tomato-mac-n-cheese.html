<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves and top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add 15g <span class="text-purple">[20g]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[30g] </span>butter

Once melted, add the sliced leek and diced shallot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[20g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g] </span>flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste coats the leek – this is your leek roux</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, then set aside until later

Tip: It doesn't need to be fully cooked, as it will go in the oven later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the macaroni is cooking, gradually whisk 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>milk into the leek roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-6 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Once the sauce has thickened, stir through your Dijon mustard, crème fraîche and vegetable stock mix and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your leek béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

Combine half your grated cheese (save the rest for later!) with your panko breadcrumbs and a drizzle of olive oil – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

Add the remaining grated cheese, season with pepper and give everything a good mix up until the cheese has meltedl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish

Top with your cherry tomatoes and the cheesy breadcrumbs and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your leek & roasted tomato mac 'n' cheese</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Dress the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Serve your leek & roasted tomato mac 'n' cheese with a generous grind of black pepper and the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy</p><br><br>
