Chop your waxy potatoes into quarters

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once fragrant, add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min further or until the flour has dissolved

Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped potatoes and mustardy stock with a generous grind of black pepper and cook, covered, for 20-22 min or until the potatoes are fork tender and sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
