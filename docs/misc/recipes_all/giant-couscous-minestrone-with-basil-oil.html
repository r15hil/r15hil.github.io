<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]

Heat a very large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, once hot, add the chopped onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and green tomato chutney in 800ml<span class="text-purple"> [1.1L] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.5L]</span> boiled water – this is your chutney stock

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, add 3/4 of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with your dried oregano, tomato paste, chutney stock, soy sauce, giant couscous and cannellini beans

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until the giant couscous is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s]

Add the ciabatta slices to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5 min or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy bread</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the bread is in the oven, chop your basil roughly, including the stalks

Add the chopped basil and remaining chopped garlic (not a fan of garlic? Go easy!) to a pestle & mortar with a very small splash of cold water and a pinch of salt

Grind to a rough paste and add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your basil oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel half your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate the remaining Italian hard cheese

Once the couscous is tender, add the sliced spring greens to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until bright green and wilted – this is your giant couscous minestrone</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the giant couscous minestrone with the crispy bread to the side

Drizzle over the basil oil, top with the grated Italian hard cheese and Italian hard cheese shavings and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
