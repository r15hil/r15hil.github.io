<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel the potatoes and chop them into chunky chips, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil to a deep baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until the oil is hot

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into wedges

Combine the chopped shallot and vegan mayo in a small bowl with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and a pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once done, drain the softened chunky chips and reserve the pot, give them a shake in the colander until the edges have fluffed up a little

Carefully remove the baking tray of hot vegetable oil from the oven and add the fluffed chunky chips

Season them with a generous pinch of salt and turn them a few times until they're fully coated in the oil

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the Marmite and 80ml<span class="text-danger"> [160ml] </span>very cold water in a small bowl, stirring continuously until fully combined – this is your Marmite water

Add 60g <span class="text-danger">[120g]</span> flour and the seaweed flakes to a separate large bowl with half the red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), a generous pinch of salt and the Marmite water

Stir everything together thoroughly until there are no lumps, then set aside for later – this is your seaweed batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain the tofu, and cut the block in half then each half in half again on a diagonal

Pat the tofu pieces dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle both sides of the tofu pieces with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, dip the floured tofu into the seaweed batter and turn it several times until fully coated

Add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side until golden and crispy – this is your seaweed battered tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Add the blanched peas to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through, then drain and return to the pot with a small knob of butter alternative and pinch of salt

Mash the peas until they come together nicely – these are your mushy peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the seaweed battered tofu with the chunky chips and mushy peas to the side

Sprinkle the chips with the remaining red wine vinegar – these are your salt & vinegar chips

Serve with the ketchup and lemon mayo to the side for dipping, and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
