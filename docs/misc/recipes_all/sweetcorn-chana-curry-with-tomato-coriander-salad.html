<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then chop it roughly

Stir the chopped spinach through the curry and stir it all together for 1-2 min or until wilted – this is your sweetcorn chana curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweetcorn chana curry over the basmati rice with the tomato & coriander salad to the side

Top with a dollop of mango chutney and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
