<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife and add them to a pot with a lid with your basmati rice, 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice 1/3 of your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the rest

Tip: Not a fan of spice? Remove the seeds!

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, ginger & garlic paste and a generous pinch of salt in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add your garam masala to the pan with your curry powder, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and ground turmeric

Stir it all together and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste and cook for 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce is slightly thickened

Once slightly thickened, add the chopped green beans and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the beans are almost tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the beans are almost tender, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your spicy king prawn madras curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy king prawn madras curry over the cardamom rice

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a grind of black pepper

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
