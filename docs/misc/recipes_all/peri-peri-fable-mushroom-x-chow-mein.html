<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Combine your Fable pulled mushrooms and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with your dried oregano, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil – these are your coated Fable mushrooms

Once hot, add the coated Fable mushrooms to the pan and cook for 8 min or until slightly charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into thick slices

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are slightly charred, add the sliced onion and carrot matchsticks to the pan with a small splash of cold water and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Cook for a further 8 min or until the carrot is tender, breaking the mushrooms up slightly with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into large pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut half your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Slice the remaining red chilli finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Roll your lemon[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into wedges

Combine your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water

Add your soy sauce, white wine vinegar and the juice of half the lemon – this is your peri-peri stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the carrot is tender, add the remaining ground smoked paprika and chopped garlic to the pan with the chopped chilli and spring onions

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the peri-peri stock and cook for 2 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the cooked noodles and give everything a good mix up – this is your peri-peri Fable mushroom chow mein</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the peri-peri Fable mushroom chow mein in a bowl

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
