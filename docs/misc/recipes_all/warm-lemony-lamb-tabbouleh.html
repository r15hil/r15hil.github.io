<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 3 min or until it's starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Discard any excess oil from the pan, then stir in the chopped garlic, ras el hanout and beef stock mix

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 8-10 min or until the beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the beef mince is cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your warm lemony beef tabbouleh and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
