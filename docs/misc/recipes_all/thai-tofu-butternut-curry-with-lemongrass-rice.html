<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped pepper and your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the vegetables have softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu in half lengthways, then slice into 8 pieces per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced tofu with your gluten-free soy sauce and cook for 5-6 min, turning once halfway until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layer[s] and set aside for later

Chop the softer inner core[s] roughly

Chop your coriander roughly

Peel and roughly chop your ginger, garlic and shallot[s]

Slice half of your red chilli[es] into rounds and roughly chop the rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, garlic, shallot, lemongrass core, chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt

Blitz to a rough paste – this is your Thai-style curry paste

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with the outer lemongrass layer[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, then cover and cook for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your sticky lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tofu is golden and crisp, transfer it to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the Thai-style curry paste and cook for 2 min until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water with the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further until the sauce has thickened

Add the crispy tofu and roasted butternut squash & pepper to the pan then gently mix it all together – this is your Thai-style tofu & butternut squash curry

Slice the remaining lime into wedges

Discard the lemongrass from the rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style tofu & butternut squash curry over the sticky lemongrass rice

Top with the chill rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
