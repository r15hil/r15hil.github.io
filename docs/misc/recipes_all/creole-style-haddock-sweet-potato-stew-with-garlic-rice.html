Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, Henderson’s Relish, tomato paste and a generous pinch of salt in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[850ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Creole-style stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato is tender, add your haddock bites to the stew and gently stir it all together

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any smaller ones into bite-sized pieces

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min, or until the haddock bites are cooked through – this is your Creole-style haddock & sweet potato stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Creole-style haddock & sweet potato stew in bowls with the garlic rice in the centre

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Season generously with black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
