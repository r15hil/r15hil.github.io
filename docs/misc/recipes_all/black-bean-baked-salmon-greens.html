<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your salmon fillet[s] to a bowl with half your five-spice mix (save the rest for later!), a pinch of sugar and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and once hot, add the salmon fillet[s] (skin-side down) and cook for 3-4 min or until the skin is crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the skin is crispy, transfer the salmon to a baking tray (skin-side up), reserving the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until cooked through – this is your crispy five-spice salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
