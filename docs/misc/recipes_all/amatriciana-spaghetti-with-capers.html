<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Peel and finely slice (don't chop) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the capers are crispy, transfer them to a plate and return the pan (and any remaining oil!) to a medium heat

Add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

Dissolve your tomato paste and your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the halved tomatoes, sliced garlic, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the tomatoes have broken down into a sauce

Once broken down, add your tomato stock with a pinch of sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the sauce with half the chopped basil and half the crispy capers (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the sauce coats the pasta – this is your Amatriciana spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your Amatriciana spaghetti and garnish with the remaining crispy capers and chopped basil

Sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
