<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to a high heat then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, nigella seeds, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your nigella rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and your curry powder in a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Add the chopped chicken pieces and mix well until they're completely coated – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cover a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil (to avoid mess!)

Add the coated chicken to the baking tray[s] and put it under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through and starting to char (no pink meat!) – this is your free range tandoori chicken</p><br><br>
