<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Middle Eastern rice dish is said to be the national dish of the Kingdom of Bahrain. To make our twist, you'll cook rice in heady, aromatic baharat spice, and serve with zingy lemon coriander prawns.

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion, chopped tomato, half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt

Cook for 2-3 min or until the onion has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the juice of your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and<span class="text-danger"> </span>the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl with the remaining chopped garlic, half the chopped coriander (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your lemon coriander sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your basmati rice, vegetable stock mix, sultanas and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and stir through the remaining chopped coriander and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the rice is nearly ready, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain your king prawns, then add to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the prawns have cooked through, add the lemon coriander sauce and cook for 30 secs – these are your lemon coriander king prawns</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemon coriander king prawns over the sultana rice and spoon over any remaining sauce – this is your Bahraini-style king prawn machboos

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
