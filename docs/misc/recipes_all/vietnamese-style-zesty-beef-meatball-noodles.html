<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide the beef mixture into 3 per person, roll into meatballs and flatten them slightly

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 5 min on each side or until nicely browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining chopped garlic and remaining chopped ginger in a bowl with your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>sugar

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Vietnamese-style dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Once the meatballs are browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add the sliced carrot to the pan and cook, covered, for 6 min or until starting to soften and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once soft, add your sugar snap peas and cook, uncovered, for 1 min further</p><br><br>
