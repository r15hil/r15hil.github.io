<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1, then wash your shredded kale and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the shredded kale to a large baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Give the shredded kale a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until crispy – this is your crispy ‘seaweed’</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tofu into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tofu to a bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and set aside to marinate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) half your garlic cloves (save the rest for later!)

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your five-spice mix and your cornflour to the bowl with the marinated tofu and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is fully coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tofu is crispy, add the onion wedges and chopped pepper to the pan with the sliced garlic and half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 4-5 min further or until the vegetables are beginning to soften – this is your salt & pepper tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Grate the remaining garlic

Combine the grated garlic with your rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce, remaining sliced chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a small bowl – this is your dipping sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salt & pepper tofu with the cooked rice, crispy ‘seaweed’ and dipping sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
