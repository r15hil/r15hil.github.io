<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone!

Dice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan with your curry powder and the rinsed red lentils

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste with half the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), half the diced mango (you'll use the rest later!) and the chopped creamed coconut</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix, sultanas and a pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until thickened – this is your coconut & mango dal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped mint with the remaining diced mango, the remaining chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your spicy mango & mint

Once the dal is ready, wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper, then add it to the pan and give everything a good mix up until the spinach has wilted – this is your coconut & mango dal

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconut & mango dal with the fluffy rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a bowl and turn out

Drizzle over your natural yoghurt and top with the spicy mango & mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
