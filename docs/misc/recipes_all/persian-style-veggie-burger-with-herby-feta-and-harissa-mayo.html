<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the ciabatta halves, cut side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), mayo and chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>water – this is your harissa mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread a spoonful of harissa mayo onto the warmed ciabatta halves, then top with a meat-free burger patty and the herby goats' cheese – this is your Persian-style veggie burger

Serve with the chips, zingy carrot & sultana slaw and any remaining harissa mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
