<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Slice the red cabbage into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> large wedges, keeping the stalks intact so they stay together, trimming away any browned edges

Top, tail and grate the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Slice the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the red cabbage wedges to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and the balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the stalks of the cabbage are fork-tender – these are your roasted red cabbage wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the cabbage is cooking, add the white long grain rice, vegetable stock mix and 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 16-18 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is almost cooked with a slight bite (you'll finish cooking it in step 6!)

Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the pine nuts, blanched almonds and hazelnuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden – these are your toasted nuts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Once the nuts are toasted, add half to a food processor (save the rest for garnish and reserve the pan!)

Add the mint leaves with the basil and the juice of 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> lemon wedges

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt and pulse until roughly blitzed – this is your nutty pesto</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the grated courgette and sliced garlic with a generous pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper, then cook for 2 min until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooked rice and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is combined, add half the nutty pesto (save the rest for later!) to the pan and mix it all together – this is your nutty pesto rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted red cabbage wedges over the nutty pesto rice

Drizzle with the remaining nutty pesto and garnish with the lemon wedges and remaining toasted nuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
