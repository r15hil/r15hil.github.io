<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with the five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar and lots of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Cut your cauliflower into small florets, then add the cauliflower florets to the batter and stir until they are evenly coated

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the coated cauliflower to the pan[s] and cook for 10-12 min or until golden and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside – this is your crispy cauliflower

Transfer the crispy cauliflower to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky cauliflower with the salt & pepper chips to the side
