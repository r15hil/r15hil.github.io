<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to a bowl with your shredded lettuce and cucumber matchsticks

Add half your peanut dressing and toss – this is your satay rice salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the satay rice salad and top with the cooked chicken strips

Drizzle over the remaining peanut dressing and garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
