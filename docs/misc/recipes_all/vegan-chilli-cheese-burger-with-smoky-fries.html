<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and most of your smoked paprika (save a little for later!) and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your smoky fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and stir until dissolved

Once dissolved, add your red wine vinegar and sliced red chilli and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chilli is pickling, drain and rinse<span class="text-danger"> </span>your black beans

Dissolve your tomato paste in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained black beans, ground cumin and remaining smoked paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened – this is your black bean chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your ultimate vegan burger patties to one side of a non-stick baking paper-lined tray and put in the oven for 10-12 min or until almost cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the patties are in the oven, wash then remove a leaf per person from your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper

Cut the remaining lettuce into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the patties are almost cooked, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add them to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the ciabatta halves are warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill each warmed ciabatta with a lettuce leaf and a cheezy vegan patty, then top the patty with the black bean chilli and the quick-pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – these are your plant-based chilli cheezeburgers

Serve the smoky fries and lettuce wedges to the side and drizzle some of the pickling liquid over the lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
