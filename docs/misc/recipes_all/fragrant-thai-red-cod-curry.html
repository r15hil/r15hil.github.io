<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the green beans are slightly tender, add the coconut stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your Thai red curry

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and top the Thai red curry with your chopped cod and a pinch of salt

Cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Thai red cod curry

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai red cod curry over the cooked rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
