<p>While the egg is cooking, add the cooked rice to the pan with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your Thai-style sausage fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and top with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
