<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s] (as finely as you can!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 60g <span class="text-purple">[90g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [120g]</span> flour to a large bowl along with your cornflour, curry powder and a generous pinch of salt

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and mix thoroughly until you are left with a smooth, thick batter

Add the sliced onion, chopped coriander, chopped ginger and garlic to the bowl with the batter and gently mix until all of the onion is coated – this is your onion bhaji mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add 2 large spoonfuls of the onion bhaji mixture per person to separate areas of the pan and press them down with the back of a spoon to flatten them into patties

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cook for 3-4 min on each side until crispy and golden

Tip: Add an extra splash of vegetable oil if the pan is looking a little dry!

Once golden and cooked through, add the patties to a plate and set aside – these are your onion bhaji patties

Wash your seasonal salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the patties are cooking, grate half of your cucumber and dice the rest

Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with your cultured coconut, mint sauce and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut raita

Add the seasonal salad to a bowl with the diced cucumber and a small drizzle of olive oil – this is your cucumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are almost done, remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle over your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – these are your chilli chips

Slice your brioche buns in half, then add to the tray with the chips and return to the oven for 3-4 min or until the brioche is warmed through and toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread a dollop of coconut raita on the toasted brioche base, then stack it up with the onion bhaji patties, mango chutney, cucumber salad and more coconut raita – this is your onion bhaji burger

Serve the onion bhaji burger with the chilli chips and any remaining cucumber salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
