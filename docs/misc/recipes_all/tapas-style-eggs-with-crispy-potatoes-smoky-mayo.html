Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season with cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), salt and pepper, then put in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<p>Once your potatoes are almost cooked, heat another pan with a matching lid with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-low heat

Crack your egg[s] into a bowl, and once the pan is hot, add the eggs in one go

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the stew, then top with the fried eggs – this is your tapas-style pepper, bean & egg stew

Serve the tapas-style pepper, bean & egg stew with the crispy potatoes and smoky mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
