<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Cut each beetroot into 8 wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place the carrot batons, beetroot wedges and chicken breast portions on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Sprinkle the cumin seeds over, then drizzle with the honey and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 20-22 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables are slightly tender with some crunch</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt (the same as you would for pasta) and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once done, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a medium pan over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pumpkin seeds and toast for 3 min or until slightly darkened and starting to pop

Set the toasted pumpkin seeds aside until serving

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped coriander, chopped ginger, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil

Season with salt and pepper and mix well – this is your dressing

Slice the remaining lime into wedges for garnish</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted chicken, beetroot and carrot over the bulgur wheat

Drizzle with the dressing and garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds and lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
