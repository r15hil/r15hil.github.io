<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Place your rice noodles into a bowl and cover with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min to soften

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has started to brown – this is your chilli & garlic oil

Once slightly browned, transfer the chilli & garlic oil into a small heatproof bowl and set aside for later, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 10-12 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<p>Once golden, add the chopped pepper and remaining garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper is starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!

Combine your tamari soy sauce and tamarind paste in a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and mix it all together – this is your tamarind sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add the drained noodles to the pan with the tamarind sauce and the chilli & garlic oil and cook for 2 min further until all the noodles are coated

Push the noodles to one side of the pan and crack your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into the other side

Stir the egg[s] with a wooden spoon and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg, then mix it all through the noodles – this is your chicken breast pad Thai with chilli & garlic oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken breast pad Thai with chilli & garlic oil

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and crushed peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
