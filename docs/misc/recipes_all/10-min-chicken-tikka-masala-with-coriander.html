<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and chopped tomato to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min until the tomato has started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water and your chicken stock mix to the pan, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for 6 min further, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your clotted cream â€“ this is your chicken tikka masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken tikka masala over the cooked rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
