<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min, stirring occasionally until golden and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a large cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once the mushrooms are golden, add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!)

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the ragù has thickened, add your soft cheese and drained tortiglioni to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water

Season with salt and pepper and stir until the sauce coats the pasta and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy lean pork and mushroom tortiglioni

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy lean pork and mushroom tortiglioni topped with the grated cheese and chopped basil

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
