<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add most of the vegetable stock (you'll use the rest later!) a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for an initial 25 min or until the rice is almost cooked</p><br><br>

Crumble your feta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and chop into bite-sized pieces

After the initial 25 min, add the spinach and chopped basa to the risotto with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Pour in the remaining vegetable stock and cook for a final 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through and all of the stock is absorbed

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the basa is cooked through, add your soft cheese and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the risotto with half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and mix it all together â€“ this is your creamy harissa basa risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy harissa basa risotto in a bowl

Garnish with the remaining ground sumac and the crumbled feta

Drizzle with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
