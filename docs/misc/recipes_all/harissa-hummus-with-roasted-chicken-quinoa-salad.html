<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle, then rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the quinoa is cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the red onion wedges and chicken breast portion[s] to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion wedges are cooked, add them to the pot of drained quinoa with the grated carrot and chopped mint

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted onion & quinoa salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl and squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon – these are your lemon-dressed leaves

Once cooked, slice the chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Dollop the harissa hummus onto plates and spread it out with the back of a spoon

Serve the sliced chicken over the hummus with the lemon-dressed leaves and roasted onion & quinoa salad to the side

Sprinkle your pumpkin seeds and black sesame seeds all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
