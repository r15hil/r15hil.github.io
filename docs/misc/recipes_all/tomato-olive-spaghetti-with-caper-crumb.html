<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your roasted garlic paste and halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 min until the tomatoes have started to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spaghetti is cooked with a slight bite

Remove from the heat and drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water, then return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the spaghetti is cooking, add your panko breadcrumbs, half of your capers (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous drizzle of olive oil to a tray

Give it all a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min until lightly toasted and golden – this is your caper crumb

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and the tomato paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add your black olives, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining capers and tomato stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further

Add a pinch of sugar and grind of black pepper – this is your tomato & olive sauce

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and dress with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl – this is your dressed salad

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato & olive sauce over the cooked spaghetti with the dressed salad to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley and sprinkle over the caper crumb

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
