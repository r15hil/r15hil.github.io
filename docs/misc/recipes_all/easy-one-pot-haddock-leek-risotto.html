<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a knob of butter to the pan along with your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the butter

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash more water if it's looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your dill finely

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Season your haddock bites with a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is tender with a slight bite, stir through the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], your soft cheese, half the lemon zest and half the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!)

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the rice with the haddock bites and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the haddock is cooked through – this is your one-pot haddock & leek risotto

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot haddock & leek risotto garnished with a lemon wedge, the remaining lemon zest and remaining chopped dill

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
