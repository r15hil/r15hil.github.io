<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp – these are your chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced onion to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your free range chicken breast portion[s] and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, drain the sliced onion in a sieve and run under cold water until cooled

Return the drained onion to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar

Mix it all together and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled pink onion</p><br><br>
