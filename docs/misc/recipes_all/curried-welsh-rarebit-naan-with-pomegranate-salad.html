<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the top and bottom off the pomegranate, then slice into quarters and add the pomegranate quarters to a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and return most of them to the large bowl (set some aside for a garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar cheese

Combine the grated cheese with the cornflour and a generous pinch of salt in a pot and mix until the cheese is fully coated

Add the curry powder and soft cheese to the pot with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk – this is your rarebit base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat the pot with the rarebit base over a medium heat

Cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and thickened – this is your curried rarebit sauce

Set the curried rarebit sauce aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once ready, transfer the baking tray with the potatoes to the bottom shelf of the oven

Preheat the grill to high

Add the naans to a baking tray then put the tray under the grill and cook for an initial 1-2 min or until the naans are toasted on one side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once toasted on one side, remove the tray from the oven and turn over the naans

Top the naans with the curried rarebit sauce and the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Return the tray to the grill and cook for 2-3 min or until the rarebit sauce is lightly browned – these are your curried Welsh rarebit naans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried Welsh rarebit naans with the pomegranate salad and roast potatoes to the side

Sprinkle over the reserved pomegranate seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
