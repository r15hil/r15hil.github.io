<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Pat the pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern and season with a generous pinch of salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a very high heat

Once hot, add the pork belly, fat side down and cook for 4 min, then flip and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer the pork to a baking tray (skin side up) and put the tray in the oven for 45 min or until cooked through

Reserve the pan

While the pork is cooking, grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(skin on)

Peel and finely slice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>red onion, then grate the remaining onion

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the grated onion and apple to a bowl with the panko breadcrumbs, half the dried sage, a few small knobs of butter and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined, then roll the mixture into 6<span class="text-danger"> [12]</span> stuffing balls and add them to the tray with the pork belly

Return the tray to the oven for the remaining cooking time</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop the potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened

Dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>boiled water

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut 2 pieces of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper and layer them over each other

Add the sliced spring greens to the middle with the chopped garlic, a knob of butter and 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> water

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a sealed parcel, then add to a baking tray and put in the oven for 8-10 min or until they're tender – these are your garlicky greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour to the pan and cook for 1 min, then add the beef stock with the remaining dried sage

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your sage & onion gravy

Once everything's done, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Finely slice the cooked pork belly with a sharp knife

Tip: Remove the crackling first for easier slicing!

Serve the pork belly slices and crackling over the mash with the garlicky greens and stuffing balls to the side

Pour the onion & sage gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
