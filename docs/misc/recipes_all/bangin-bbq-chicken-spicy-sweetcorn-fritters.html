<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to medium-high, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your chicken thighs to an oven-proof dish (make sure the chicken isn't overlapping!) with a drizzle of olive oil and your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your BBQ chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up so that the chicken is fully coated and put it under the grill for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through and caramelised (no pink meat!)

While the chicken is grilling, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, drained sweetcorn, chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), cornflour, your egg[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and<span class="text-danger"> </span>1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour to a bowl and mix everything together

Crumble in your feta, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir to combine – this is your fritter mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, spoon the fritter mixture into the pan, roughly divided into 2 per person<span class="text-danger"> </span>and cook for 4 min on one side, then 2 min on the other until golden and cooked through – these are your spicy sweetcorn fritters

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine most of the chopped chives (save some for garnish!) with your mayo

Add a little splash of cold water to loosen and season with a crack of black pepper – this is your chive mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl with the tomato wedges and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Layer a spicy sweetcorn fritter with a piece of BBQ chicken then a dollop of chive mayo and repeat the process again until you have a stack

Serve the BBQ chicken & spicy sweetcorn fritters stack with the dressed salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
