<p><strong>Description:</strong> Paneer (pan-ear) is an Indian cheese that is a great meat alternative in a lot of traditional Indian dishes. In that spirit, we've developed a spicy paneer burger, served with an Indian carrot and cucumber slaw, curry mayo and spiced potatoes. This is true fusion food, with the meatiness of the cheese replicating the meat in a conventional burger. </p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain over a sieve, reserving the pot


Return the potatoes back to the pan with a large knob of butter and 3/4 of the&nbsp;curry powder (reserve the rest for later)


Cook for 1 min until all the potatoes are coated in the curry butter


Season with a pinch of salt


&nbsp;


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Mix the mayonnaise&nbsp;with the remaining curry powder&nbsp;and season with a small pinch of salt - this is your curry mayo


Once the ciabatta rolls have cooled, slice in half and fill with the paneer, Indian&nbsp;slaw&nbsp;and&nbsp;curry mayo


Serve the potatoes with the remaining Indian&nbsp;slaw


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
