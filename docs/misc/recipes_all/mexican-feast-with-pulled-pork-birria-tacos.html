<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and grate your garlic

Chop your potatoes (skin on) into bite-sized pieces

Add your dried ancho chilli[es] to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside to soak</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chopped potatoes to the bowl with the garlic and give them a good mix up

Transfer the garlic coated potatoes to one side of a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a knob of butter, half your ground smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to the baking tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until the corn is tender and the potatoes are crispy – these are your smoky corn cobettes and mojo de ajo potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Drain the ancho chilli[es], then roll up and slice into thin strips (as finely as you can!), discard the seeds and stalk

Dissolve your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and beef stock mix in 350ml<span class="text-purple"> [455ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water and add a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your birria-style stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the remaining grated garlic, remaining ground smoked paprika, the sliced ancho chilli and your BBQ pulled pork

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the birria-style stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the pork is warmed through and the sauce has thickened

Tip: The sauce should be slightly loose so you can dip in your finished tacos!

Once the pork is warmed through, pull it apart using two forks and mix into the sauce – this is your birria-style pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once everything is nearly ready, add your tortillas to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, set the birria-style pork, warmed tortillas, grated cheese, remaining sliced onion and half the chopped coriander in the centre of the table (build into tacos then dip them back in the birria sauce for an authentic Mexican experience!)

Serve the smoky corn cobette[s] and mojo de ajo potatoes to the side

Top the corn with the sliced spring onion and the potatoes with the remaining coriander and enjoy!</p><br><br>
