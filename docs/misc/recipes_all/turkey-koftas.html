<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>250g British turkey thigh mince</li>
<li>30g walnuts</li>
<li>30g breadcrumbs</li>
<li>20g fresh coriander</li>
<li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
<li>1 spring onion</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>4 wodden skewers</li>
<li>120g couscous</li>
<li>2 tbsp tahini paste</li>
<li>200g carrots</li>
<li>30g sultanas</li>
<li>1 lemon</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Soak the skewers in cold water until step 2 (this prevents burning whilst cooking)<br /><br />Peel and very finely chop (or grate) the garlic


Add the garlic to a large mixing bowl with the turkey mince, breadcrumbs and ground cumin - season generously with salt and plenty of pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Mix the mince well with clean hands


Divide the mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">(8)</span> equal portions and shape into hotdogs (using wet hands helps shape the mixture)


Carefully pierce the skewer through each hotdog, then squeeze the meat tightly around the skewers, so it covers 2/3rd of the skewer


These are your koftas for step 4</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a very large wide based pan (preferably non-stick) on a medium heat


Add the walnuts and toast for 5-6 min or until starting to turn a darker colour, then remove from the heat (set them aside until step 6) whilst reserving the pan for the next step</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle for step 5


Place the pan over a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil, and when hot, add the koftas 


Cook on all sides (total time approx. 13-16 min), or until browned and cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the couscous and sultanas to a large bowl with 200ml <span class="text-danger">(400ml)</span> of boiled water and cover


Set aside for 10 min then fluff with a fork


Once fluffed, add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">(1)</span> lemon with the spring onion, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(6 tbsp)</span> of olive oil and salt and pepper to your taste


Set aside for step 8</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel the carrots, discarding the root ends, and grate them into the couscous bowl


Chop the coriander finely (including the stalks), and add it to the bowl


Chop the toasted walnuts roughly, and add them to the bowl


Mix well with a fork and season with salt and pepper to your taste</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the tahini with 50ml <span class="text-danger">(100ml)</span> of boiled water and mix until smooth


Add the remaining lemon juice, 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(6 tbsp)</span> of olive oil and season with salt and pepper to your taste - this is your tahini dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the koftas over the couscous with the tahini sauce drizzled over or to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
