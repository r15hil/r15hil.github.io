<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, remove the dish from the oven and mix the cheese sauce through the roasted cauliflower

Top the dish with the rolled pastry, brush with a little milk and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Return the dish to the oven for a further 20 min or until the pastry is puffed up, golden and cooked through – this is your cauliflower cheese pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining Dijon mustard and remaining grated garlic in a bowl with the cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your mustard dressing

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and toss through the mustard dressing – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cauliflower cheese pie with the roast waxy potatoes and dressed salad to the side
