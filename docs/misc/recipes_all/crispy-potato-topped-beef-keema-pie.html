<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, and boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]

Once the beef mince has browned, add the chopped onion and diced carrot to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for a further 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

Wash your spinach, then add to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min, stirring continuously, until the spinach has wilted

Add your blanched peas and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your beef keema</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the beef keema is thickening, return the drained potatoes to the pot with your ground turmeric, a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Gently mix the potatoes until they're evenly coated – these are your turmeric potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the beef keema to an oven-proof dish and top it with the turmeric potatoes

Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – this is your crispy potato-topped beef keema pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Allow the crispy potato-topped beef keema pie to cool slightly before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the crispy potato-topped beef keema pie

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
