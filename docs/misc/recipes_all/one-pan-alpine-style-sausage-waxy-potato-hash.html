<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the potatoes are fork-tender

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) and onion wedges to the pan and cook for 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 pans!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, crush them lightly with a fork in the bowl – these are your crushed potatoes

Add the crushed potatoes to the pan with your roasted garlic paste, a small knob of butter and your dried thyme and give everything a good mix up

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min or until the butter has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 2 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your one-pan Alpine-style sausage & waxy potato hash

Add your salad to the mustard dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pan Alpine-style sausage & waxy potato hash with the dressed salad to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
