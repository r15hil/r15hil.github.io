<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chips to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Chop your capers roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chopped capers to a bowl with your mayo, a squeeze of your lemon, most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) and a grind of black pepper

Stir it all together – this is your tartare sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and sprinkle each side with your vegetable stock mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once your chips have had an initial 15 min, move them to one side of the baking tray[s] and add the seasoned basa to the other side

Top the seasoned basa with your panko breadcrumbs (pile them on for extra crunch!)

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to the basa and season with salt and pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min further or until the breadcrumbs are brown and crispy and the fish is cooked through – this is your one tray breaded fish & chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything is nearly ready, boil half a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one tray breaded fish & chips with the blanched peas and tartare sauce to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and the remaining chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
