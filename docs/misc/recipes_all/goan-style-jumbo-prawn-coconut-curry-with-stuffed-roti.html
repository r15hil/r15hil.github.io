<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Add your basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span>[500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onions

Slice your green chilli[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top half your rotis with the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated cheese, 2/3 of the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a grind of black pepper

Place the remaining rotis on top so you end up with 1 roti sandwich per person, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-7 minutes or until the cheese has melted

Once done, top the roti[s] with a small knob of butter – this is your chilli cheese roti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain your jumbo prawns

Once hot, add the drained prawns and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the prawns are cooking, trim your green beans

Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the trimmed green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until tender and slightly charred – these are your charred green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with your tamarind paste and mango chutney – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the prawns are starting to brown, add the remaining sliced spring onion, ginger & garlic paste, tomato paste, curry powder and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has slightly reduced and the prawns are cooked through – this is your Goan-style Jumbo prawn & coconut curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the chilli cheese roti into quarters

Serve the Goan-style Jumbo prawn & coconut curry next to the basmati rice with the charred green beans and chilli cheese roti quarters to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
