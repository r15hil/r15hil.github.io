<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces, then add them to a heatproof bowl and cover the bowl with cling film

Pierce a few holes in the top with a fork, then put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the potatoes are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and sliced carrot and cook for 3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the mince is browned, reduce the heat to medium-high

Add your dried thyme to the pan with your tomato paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your Henderson's Relish and beef stock mix to the pan with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and a pinch of salt and mix it all together

Cook for a final 4 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your lamb mince</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Add the refreshed peas to a bowl with your mint sauce and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your minty peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter to the bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Mash the potatoes with a fork until the butter is completely melted and fully combined – these are your buttery tatties</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lamb mince with the buttery tatties and minty peas to the side

Garnish with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
