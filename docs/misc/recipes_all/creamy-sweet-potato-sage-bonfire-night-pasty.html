<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Strip your sage from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and dice 1/4 of your sweet potato[es] and set the remaining aside (you'll use the rest later!)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic and chopped sage and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add the diced sweet potato and cook for a further 1-2 min

Meanwhile, dice your chestnut mushrooms roughly

Add the diced mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and a splash of water to the pan, then cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your vegetable stock mix into the pan with 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 4-5 min or until the stock has been absorbed and the sweet potato is tender

Slice the remaining sweet potato and your potato[es] (skins on) into thin disc shapes (as finely as you can) – these are your potato crisps

Wash your kale, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the potato crisps to a baking tray with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy

Once the mushrooms have softened, add your soft cheese to the pan and mix everything together

Season with black pepper and cook for 1-2 min further until the sauce has thickened – this is your pasty filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 2 <span class="text-purple">[3]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4]</span>

Line a baking tray (or two!) with tin foil and add the pastry

Divide the pasty filling into 2 <span class="text-purple">[3]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>and add the mixture to one corner of each, then fold the corner over to make a triangle shape and crimp the edges with a fork to seal each pasty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the pasties to the oven for 12-15 min or until the pastry is golden – these are your creamy sweet potato & sage Bonfire Night pasties

Once the potato crisps are looking golden, remove the tray from the oven and lay the shredded kale over the top with a drizzle of olive oil, then return the tray to the oven for 4-5 min or until crispy – these are your potato & kale crisps

Combine your mayo and onion marmalade in a small bowl – this is your onion marmalade dip</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy sweet potato & sage Bonfire Night pasties with the potato & kale crisps and onion marmalade dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
