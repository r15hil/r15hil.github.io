<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Transfer your BBQ pulled pork to an oven-proof dish with half of the juices, discard the remaining juices

Cover the dish with tin foil and put it in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the dish with the pulled pork joint from the oven and discard the tin foil

Spoon the char siu-style sauce all over the joint and return it to the oven for 10-12 min further, basting it twice more until the sauce is thick and the pork is nicely glazed – this is your char siu-style pork</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, carefully slice the char siu pork into 3 strips per person

Pierce the bao bun packet[s] with a few holes and microwave for 1-2 min

To build your buns, fill each bao bun with the sliced char siu pork and top with some of the quick-pickled mooli slaw

Drizzle over a little of the sriracha mayo and garnish with half of your crispy onions and coriander leaves (save the rest for later!) – these are your char siu-style pork bao buns</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the char siu-style pork bao buns with the fries and remaining quick-pickled mooli slaw to the side

Load up the fries with any remaining sriracha mayo, crispy onions and coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
