<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pepper is softening, cut your chicken thighs into thick strips

Add your cornflour to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and give it a good mix

Add the chicken strips to the bowl and toss to coat them evenly in the cornflour, then set aside – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat, then add the coated chicken and cook for 4 min on each side, or until it's nice and browned (try not to turn the chicken until it's golden!)

Once golden, transfer the browned chicken to a baking tray (reserve the pan) and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken thigh</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your red chilli relish, tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil and soy sauce with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[70ml]</span> water and stir it all together

Add the mixture to the softened pepper and bring to the boil

Once boiling, remove the sauce from the heat – this is your Korean-style sauce

Tip: If you have a food processor, blitz the sauce until smooth for a more authentic look and feel!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your pak choi and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut the base off the pak choi and discard, then chop the rest finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat, then once hot, add the chopped pak choi and garlic with a pinch of salt

Cook, covered, for 4 min or until it's wilted – this is your garlic pak choi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic pak choi with the basmati rice, crispy chicken thigh and Korean-style sauce

Garnish with your black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
