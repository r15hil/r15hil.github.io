<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4

Boil a kettle

Tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces and add them to one side of a baking tray

Drizzle generously with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Trim, then cut your green beans in half

Cut out a large piece of tin foil and place the halved green beans in the middle

Scrunch up the edges of the foil slightly, add a small splash of water and close the parcel tightly

Add the parcel to the tray and pop it in the oven for 15 min or until the croutons are golden and crispy and the beans are cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your eggs to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)

Boil for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs

While the eggs boil, fill a bowl of ice-cold water ready for later

Tip: Use the Gousto ice packs to chill the water!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your chives finely

Peel half or your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings and grate the rest

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then rip into roughly bite-sized pieces and add them to a large mixing bowl

Add half of the grated Italian hard cheese and half of the chopped chives to the bowl (you'll use the rest later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the eggs are done, drain and add them to the ice-cold water (this stops them cooking further)

Peel, then finely slice your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your white wine vinegar, mayo, sliced shallot, remaining Italian hard cheese and chopped chives with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl

Peel and grate your garlic into the bowl (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix to combine – this is your Caesar dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your croutons and cooked green beans to the bowl with the lettuce and toss all together – this is your Caesar salad

Peel the cooled eggs and cut them in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Caesar salad in bowls topped with the egg halves, crunchy ciabatta pieces and Italian hard cheese shavings

Drizzle the Caesar dressing all over

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
