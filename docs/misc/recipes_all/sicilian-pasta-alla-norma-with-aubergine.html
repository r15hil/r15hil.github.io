<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces, then add the chopped aubergine to a non-stick baking paper-lined tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the aubergine is cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until broken down into a thick sauce

Tip: Crush the tomatoes gently with a wooden spoon as they're cooking!

Add the tomato stock, balsamic vinegar, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar and cook for 7-8 min further or until thickened to a rich pasta sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is cooking, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite and once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Chop your basil finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the roasted aubergine (reserve the tray), half the chopped basil, half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) and the drained tortiglioni, then stir it all together (add a splash of the starchy pasta water if the pasta is looking a little dry!) – this is your Sicilian-style pasta alla Norma with aubergine

Meanwhile, add your pine nuts to the reserved tray and put in the oven for 1-2 min or until lightly toasted (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sicilian-style pasta alla Norma with aubergine and garnish with the toasted pine nuts, remaining chopped basil and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
