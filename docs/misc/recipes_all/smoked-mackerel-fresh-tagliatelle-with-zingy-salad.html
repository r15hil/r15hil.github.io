Combine the juice of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your zingy dressing

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Toss the shredded lettuce in the zingy dressing, then set this aside until serving – this is your zingy salad</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 30 secs or until it starts to sizzle slightly

Add the torn smoked mackerel and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the drained tagliatelle and a few splashes of the reserved starchy pasta water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper then increase the heat to high

Add the soft cheese and cook for 1-2 min, stirring until everything is combined and the sauce begins to stick to the pasta

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<p>Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon and add half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later) with half the chopped dill & chives (save the rest for garnish!)

Give everything a good mix up and season with a generous grind of pepper – this is your smoked mackerel tagliatelle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked mackerel tagliatelle with the zingy salad to the side

Sprinkle the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and reserved chopped dill & chives all over and then season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
