<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then using a small bowl as a guide, cut the rolled pastry into 1 circle per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the pastry circle[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then score the pastry circle[s] inside the border in a criss-cross pattern

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through

Once cooked, set aside – this is your vol-au-vent</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned

Meanwhile, combine 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water in a measuring jug with your Marmite and chicken stock mix – this is your marmite stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add your diced onion, diced carrot and sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and your bay leaf[ves] with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the marmite stock with a generous grind of pepper and cook for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your chicken stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Add the salad to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, carefully slice the scored top off the vol-au-vent using the border as a guide, then push down the inside

Spoon the chicken stew inside the vol-au-vent base and top with the vol-au-vent lid

Serve the chips and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
