<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle, then wash your hispi cabbage[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>then pat dry with kitchen paper and cut into quarters lengthways

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the hispi cabbage quarters to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min on each cut-side or until charred

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once charred, transfer the hispi cabbage quarters to a baking tray (or two!) and pour 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water over the cabbage

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cover the baking tray[s] tightly with tin foil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until tender – this is your roasted cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your couscous to a large heatproof bowl with your tomato paste, half the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sultanas, diced apricots and the diced shallot

Add a very generous pinch of salt, then give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Add 130ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[260ml]</span> boiled water, then cover and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your feta and soft cheese in a small bowl with 40ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> boiled water and whisk until thickened to a sauce-like consistency – this is your whipped feta sauce

Combine the remaining harissa (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the chopped garlic with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>butter in a small bowl – this is your harissa butter

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the liquid has been absorbed, fluff the couscous with a fork

Add the spinach and most of the chopped parsley (save some for garnish!) – this is your fruity couscous</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the cabbage has had an initial 25-30 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and discard the foil

Squeeze the juice of the orange[s] over the roasted cabbage

Top with the harissa butter, then return the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven and cook for 3-4 min or until the butter has melted – this is your charred harissa cabbage</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the charred harissa cabbage over the fruity couscous and drizzle over the whipped feta sauce

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and sliced chillies (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
