<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Dice your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced potatoes and half the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are beginning to soften, add the diced chicken breast to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Once golden, add the chopped garlic with the chopped ginger, garam masala, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until everything is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your chicken breast curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your mini cosberg lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Combine the grated carrot, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce in a large bowl with the chopped coriander and the remaining diced onion

Season with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your carrot sambal salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the top off your ciabatta[s] and hollow out the middle with a spoon

Tip: Save the removed middles to make breadcrumbs for another recipe!

Place the hollowed ciabatta bases and ciabatta lids on a baking tray and put in the oven for 5 min or until they’re hot and toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken breast curry inside the toasted ciabatta base and top with the toasted ciabatta lid – this is your chicken breast bunny chow

Serve the carrot sambal salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
