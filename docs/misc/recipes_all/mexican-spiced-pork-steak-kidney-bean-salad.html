<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), dried oregano, half your ground cumin (you'll use the rest later!), a generous pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your Mexican-style spice blend</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper

Rub with a little vegetable oil, then add to the Mexican-style spice blend and turn several times until they're fully coated and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your kidney beans

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the drained kidney beans and remaining ground cumin with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the skins have softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the softened kidney beans to a bowl and set aside to cool

Return the pan to the heat on high with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and once hot add the spiced steak and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through

Once done, transfer the cooked steak to a clean chopping board, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for 2 min – this is your Mexican-style spiced pork steak</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomato, cucumber, shallot, coriander and the juice of half the lime[s], a generous drizzle of olive oil to the softened kidney beans with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your kidney bean salad

Combine the chopped mint, yoghurt and the juice from the remaining lime in a small bowl

Season with a crack of black pepper – this is your limey mint yoghurt

Trim then, slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board

Serve the sliced steak over the limey mint yoghurt with the kidney bean salad to the side

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
