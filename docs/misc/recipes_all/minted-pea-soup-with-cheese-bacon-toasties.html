<h4>Step 7</h4>

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your minted pea soup

Tip: Add a splash of boiled water if the soup is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Sandwich the ciabatta bases and lids together and cut them in half diagonally – these are your cheese & bacon toasties

Serve the minted pea soup in bowls with the cheese & bacon toasties to the side

Break the remaining smoked streaky bacon into shards and sprinkle over the soup

Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and enjoy!</p><br><br>
