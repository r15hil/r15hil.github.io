<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Wash, then remove the leaves from your cauliflower[s] and reserve them for later

Slice the cauliflower[s] into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>steak per person, approx. 3cm thick (use the middle part as it’s larger)

Tip: Save any leftover florets for another recipe!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the cauliflower steak[s] to<span class="text-danger"> </span>a large oven-proof dish (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into wedges and add them to the dish[es]

Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Put the dish[es] in the oven for an initial 30 min or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Mix the grated cheese with your cornflour in a jug

Add your single creamy soy, vegetable stock mix, wholegrain mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until well combined – this is your cheese sauce</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, add the reserved cauliflower leaves to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-8 min or until crispy

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the chopped cherry tomatoes to the salad and drizzle over your red wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the all-in-one creamy cauliflower cheese with the dressed salad and crispy cauliflower leaves to the side
