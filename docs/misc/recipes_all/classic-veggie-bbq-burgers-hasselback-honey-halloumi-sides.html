<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Once hot, add the hasselback halloumi and cook for 30 secs on each size or until golden

Once done, transfer to a piece of tin foil and scrunch up the edges around it

Drizzle the honey all over, making sure to get it into all of the cracks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the hasselback halloumi in the oven for 5-8 min or until really soft and warmed through – this is your hasselback honey halloumi

Once everything's almost done, slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them to the oven on a separate tray for 3 min or until warmed through

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the warmed brioche base with dollop of your ketchup, then top with a handful of salad leaves, the meat-free patty, a few tomato slices and the warmed brioche lid

Serve with the hasselback honey halloumi, pesto pasta salad, sweetcorn cobette and remaining salad leaves to the side

Drizzle the salad with some olive oil and squeeze over the juice of the remaining lemon
