<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble your ultimate vegan burger patty[ies] into the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<p>Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the sliced green chilli to a small bowl with the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli

Combine your carrot & cabbage slaw mix in a large bowl with the juice of the remaining lime, the chopped coriander and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chipotle stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the crumbled meat-free burger has browned, add the chipotle stock to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your chipotle meat-free mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the chipotle meat-free mix, coriander slaw and sriracha mayo evenly between the warmed tortillas and top with with the quick-pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
