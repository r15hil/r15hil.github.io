<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion, carrot and green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the curry powder, half the cumin seeds (save the rest for later!) and the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, add the basmati rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the rice for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the rice and return it to the pan with a knob of butter (or butter alternative)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[550ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Chop the tomatoes finely

Once the spices are fragrant, add the tomato stock and chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for 8 min or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the vegetables are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once done, layer half of the vegetables over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, using a slotted spoon to leave most of the sauce in the pan (you'll use this later!)

Top the vegetable layer with half of the cooked rice and repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of rice

Tear half of the mint leaves over the rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour, then unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 2cm thickness with a rolling pin

Top the dish with the pastry and crimp the edges until sealed (as you would a pie!)

Brush with a little milk (or milk alternative) and sprinkle over the remaining cumin seeds

Cut 2 holes in the pastry and put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through – this is your veggie biryani</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the pastry is cooking, return the sauce to a low heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened slightly – this is your biryani gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the veggie biryani and garnish with the remaining mint leaves

Dollop over the biryani gravy

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
