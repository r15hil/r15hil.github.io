<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [60g]</span> butter into small pieces

Cut long rectangles of tin foil (approx. the size of A3 sheets of paper), overlap the foil and place on a baking tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place your chicken thighs in the centre of the doubled foil (you'll need to 2 rectangles for 4 people) on a baking tray

Scatter with the chopped ginger and dot the butter evenly over

Drizzle your soy sauce, honey and rice vinegar evenly over the chicken thighs

Fold the edges around the foil upwards to enclose the sauce around the chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the halved pak choi, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly brown

Season with a pinch of salt

Once brown, add a splash of water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until soft</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cashew nuts to a separate baking tray and put them in the oven for 3-4 min or until they have darkened slightly in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once cooled, chop them coarsely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked chicken over the cooked rice, with the pak choi to the side

Spoon the soy honey butter over the baked chicken and garnish with the toasted cashews

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
