<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and your roasted garlic paste with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle</p><br><br>
