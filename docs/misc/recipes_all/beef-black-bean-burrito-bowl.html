<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml [230ml] <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dice your tomato[es]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add your beef mince and cook for 7-8 min or until crispy, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once crispy, add your ground cumin and cook for 2 min further or until fragrant and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy cumin beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the beef mince is cooking, boil half a kettle

Grate your cheddar cheese

Add your natural yoghurt to a bowl with your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and give it a good mix up – this is your chipotle yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the crispy cumin beef to a plate and set aside

Drain and rinse your black beans

Return the pan (and any oil left from the mince) to a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained black beans, ground smoked paprika and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – these are your smoky beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the beef stock mix in 150ml [195ml]  <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Add the beef stock and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further

Remove the smoky beans from the heat and mash into a semi-smooth paste – these are your smoky refried beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of the remaining lime with 1 tbsp [1 1/2 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Add the shredded lettuce and diced tomato to the bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your chopped salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, top the cooked rice with the crispy cumin beef and serve the chopped salad and refried smoky beans to the side – this is your beef & smoky black bean burrito bowl

Drizzle over the chipotle yoghurt and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
