<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish is inspired by one of Hong Kong's many signature dishes, the moreish, umami-packed clay pot rice. The rice absorbs all the juices from the chicken and mushrooms, and you'll amp up the flavours even more with a sweet-savoury sauce. </p>

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your basmati rice and Chinese rice wine to the pan with your chicken stock mix and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add your peas to the top of the rice, without stirring

Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a final 2 min or until the rice is slightly crispy on the base of the pan

Once slightly crispy, gently stir the peas through the rice and season with salt and pepper – this is your Hong Kong-style chicken & mushroom rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Hong Kong-style chicken & mushroom rice in bowls

Drizzle over the hoisin dressing and garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
