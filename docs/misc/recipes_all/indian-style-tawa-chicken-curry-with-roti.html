<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the marinated chicken and cook for 5 min on each side or until golden and crispy

Once done transfer the tawa-style chicken to a plate (this will go back in the pan again later) and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Top, tail and chop the radishes into quarters

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Add the diced cucumber, radish quarters and chopped mint leaves (save a little for garnish!) to a bowl with the juice of the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt – this is your chopped salad</p><br><br>
