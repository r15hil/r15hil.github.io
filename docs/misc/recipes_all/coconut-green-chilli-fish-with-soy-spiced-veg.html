<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger then peel and finely slice half of your shallot[s] then chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Chop your green chilli[es] finely (deseed if you can't handle the heat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your chopped ginger, garlic, coriander, green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin and sliced shallot to a food processor and blitz until smooth – this is your green chilli paste

Chop your creamed coconut roughly

Dissolve the chopped coconut cream and half of your soy sauce in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Line a baking tray with baking paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and chop your carrots into quarters lengthways, then into batons

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice the remaining shallot[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the carrot batons, pepper strips and sliced shallot to the tray with the remaining soy sauce, cumin seeds and a generous drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender – this is your soy-spiced veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your green chilli paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2-3 min – this is your coconut & green chilli sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Gently add the basa to the pan and cook, covered, for 5 min or until the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconut & green chilli fish with the soy-spiced veg and basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
