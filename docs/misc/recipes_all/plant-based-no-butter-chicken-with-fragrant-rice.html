<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add your cardamom pods and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your fragrant rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Whilst the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, curry powder and ground paprika to the pan, then cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the diced tomato and cook for 3-4 min or until the veg has broken down to make a thick sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy tomato stock

Once the veg has broken down, add the creamy tomato stock and most of your creamy single soy (save a small splash for serving!) and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce is starting to thicken</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the sauce is thickening, chop your meat-free chick'n into small bite-sized pieces

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has started to thicken, stir through the chopped meat-free chick'n and cook for 6-7 min further or until warmed through – this is your plant-based no butter chick'n

Discard the cardamom pods from the fragrant rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based no butter chick'n over the fragrant rice

Drizzle over the remaining creamy single soy and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
