<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving 100ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> [200ml] </span>of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs, walnuts and pine nuts to a food processor with the chopped shallot, crushed garlic, vegetable stock mix and half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!)

Add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until you are left with a smooth paste – this is your walnut pesto

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!</p><br><br>
