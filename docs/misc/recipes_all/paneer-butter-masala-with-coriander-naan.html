<h3>Instructions</h3>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/2337-Step-1-x200.jpg' alt='Step 1 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered to steam, until serving

While the rice is cooking, chop your paneer into bite-sized cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and boil half a kettle

Once the pan is hot, add the paneer cubes and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring.

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate for later (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your cherry tomatoes into small, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to the heat with a knob of butter

Add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes, garam masala and ground turmeric and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomatoes have started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> [300ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock to the pan with your ground almonds and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has started to thicken

While the sauce thickens, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naan once it's out of the toaster!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, stir through half of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and the browned paneer and cook for 1 min – this is your paneer butter masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the paneer butter masala over the basmati rice with the warmed naan to the side

Top with the remaining natural yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
