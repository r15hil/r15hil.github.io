<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and slice your red onion[s] as finely as you can

Add 1/4 of the sliced onion (you’ll use the rest later!) to a bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced onion and your chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt

Cook for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your curry powder to the pan with your black mustard seeds, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground turmeric

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the cooked rice to the pan with your blanched peas, chicken stock mix and a knob of butter

Stir it all together and cook over a low heat for 2-3 min or until the peas are warmed through – this is your gunpowder-style rice with chicken

Drain the quick-pickled onion, discard the liquid – this is your pickled onion</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the gunpowder-style rice with chicken topped with your natural yoghurt, mango chutney and pickled onion

Season with a generous pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
