<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges, put them on a baking tray, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper


Put them in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and grate the beetroot into a sieve, over a bowl, then press to release any excess juice&nbsp;(you'll use this later!)


Tip: try and squeeze as much juice out as you can, this will help the beet burgers stick together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the tarragon finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic


Pat the feta dry with kitchen paper and break it up into small pieces&nbsp;


Peel and slice the red&nbsp;onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the grated&nbsp;beetroot, garlic, feta, breadcrumbs, egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, half of the tarragon and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper &nbsp;


Slice the ciabattas in half and then into 4 (see picture) - this will give you 4 sliders each


Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1-2 tbsp olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add&nbsp;the onion&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until slightly softened&nbsp;


Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the beetroot juice and cook for a further 5 min


Once the onions are cooked, transfer them to a dish, wipe the pan clean and reserve it for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Divide the beetroot mixture into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> and shape into balls, roughly the same size as a golf ball


Flatten each ball slightly to make beetroot&nbsp;patties


Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil


&nbsp;

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, gently add the beetroot patties to the pan one by one (you may need to do this in batches) and cook for 2-3 min on each side


Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, vinegar and remaining tarragon with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with salt and pepper


Drizzle&nbsp;the ciabattas with olive oil and put them&nbsp;into the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble the sliders&nbsp;with the tarragon mayo and onions and serve the potato&nbsp;wedges to the side&nbsp;


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
