<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper

Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a very generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a very high heat

Once very hot, add the pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 4 min or until coloured and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side

Once crisp, transfer the pork to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 40-45 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the pork belly is cooking, cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30-35 min or until the chips are cooked through and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your tomato ketchup, Henderson's Relish and cider vinegar with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar in a bowl – this is your BBQ sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Top, tail (no need to peel) and grate your carrot[s]

Cut your apple[s] (skin on) into matchsticks and discard the core[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sliced spring onion, grated carrot and apple matchsticks to a large bowl

Add your mayo, white wine vinegar and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your apple slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pork has had 40 min, remove the tray from the oven, scrunch the foil edges up (this stops the sauce escaping!) and spoon over the BBQ sauce

Return the tray to the oven for 5-7 min

Once done, remove the roasted pork belly from the oven, transfer it to a clean board and leave to rest for 5 min, then slice it finely – this is your BBQ pork belly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced BBQ pork belly with the apple slaw and chips to the side

Drizzle the remaining BBQ sauce over the pork

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
