<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add the chopped shallot, lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!), panko breadcrumbs and half the chopped ginger to a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your lean pork mixture</p><br><br>

Add the lean pork meatballs to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your toasted sesame oil with the chopped green beans, remaining chopped ginger and half of your soy sauce and cook for 4-5 min or until the beans are beginning to soften

Tip: Add a drizzle of vegetable oil if it's looking a little dry!

Once beginning to soften, add the spinach and cook for 1-2 min further or until wilted – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
