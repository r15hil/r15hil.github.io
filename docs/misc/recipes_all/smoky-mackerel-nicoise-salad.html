<p><strong>Description:</strong> Salade niçoise (French pronunciation: 'ni’ swaz') is traditionally presented as a composed salad of tomatoes, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies, dressed with a vinaigrette. The Gousto version uses our locally sourced British mackerel and a punchy vinaigrette for a hearty and healthy dinner salad. Nice-oise!</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the eggs to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)


Once boiling, boil for exactly&nbsp;8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs


Once done, cool the eggs by running them under cold water for 3 min


Tip: cooling the eggs completely makes them easier to peel</p><br><br>
