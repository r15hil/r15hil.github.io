<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your fennel seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind (or finely chop if you don't have a pestle and mortar) to a fine powder</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your beef mince and ground fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) in a bowl with half your ground cumin (save the rest for later!), your ground paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the chopped garlic

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your merguez-style mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Divide the merguez-style mix and roll into small sausage shapes (3 per person!) – these are your merguez-style koftas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the merguez-style koftas and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6-7 min then remove the lid

Cook, uncovered, for 2-3 min or until the koftas are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the chopped tomato, shallot and coriander in a bowl with the remaining ground cumin, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cumin salsa

Combine your harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and mayo in a separate bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your harissa mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your ciabatta[s] to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until warm and crusty

Carefully slice in half before serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill your warmed ciabatta with some harissa mayo, the merguez-style koftas and some cumin salsa – this is your merguez-style sandwich

Serve the merguez-style sandwich with the chips, remaining cumin salsa and remaining harissa mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
