<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced beef to the dish with a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Drain and rinse your black beans

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Slice your green chilli[es] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the onion wedges and crushed garlic to the dish with your tomato paste and 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Add 550ml <span class="text-purple">[720ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml] </span>boiled water with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and beef stock mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the drained black beans with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 55-60 min or until the sauce is rich and the beef is tender – this is your oven-baked chipotle beef stew

Meanwhile, add the potatoes to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 50 min or until cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the stew has 30 min remaining, add the chopped chilli to a small bowl with your cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>sugar and set aside – this is your quick-pickled green chilli

Once everything's ready, remove the potatoes from the oven and crush them firmly with a spatula or the bottom of a plate, then add a large knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the oven-baked chipotle beef stew in bowls with the crushed potatoes to the side

Top the potatoes with the quick-pickled green chilli and pickling liquid – these are your chilli pickle potatoes

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
