<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with your cumin seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pot with a lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, tear your white cup mushrooms into the pot and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms are starting to brown, add a small knob of butter with half the chopped garlic, your ground turmeric and your basmati rice and give everything a good mix up

Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your mushroom biryani</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

Once the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add your samosas, then return the tray[s] to the oven for 10-13 min or until the potatoes are crisp and the samosas are hot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is lightly browned, add a small knob of butter, the remaining chopped garlic, your garam masala and half your curry powder (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with your chicken stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling reduce the heat to medium

Cook for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the potatoes and samosas are ready, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top the potatoes with the spinach, a couple of small knobs of butter and the remaining curry powder

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 1-2 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, give everything a good mix up – this is your roast saag aloo and samosas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mint sauce with a small drizzle of your double cream (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl – this is your minty dip

Once the chicken is cooked through, add most of the remaining double cream (save a little for a garnish!) and cook for 2 min further – this is your chicken tikka masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your chicken tikka masala and drizzle over your remaining double cream and garnish with a grind of pepper

Serve your mushroom biryani, roast saag aloo, samosas and minty dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
