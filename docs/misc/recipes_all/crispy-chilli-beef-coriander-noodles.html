<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beef has crisped, add the chopped garlic, ginger and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add your red chilli relish and half of the soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 4 min or until everything is browned and crispy (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chilli beef</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pot of drained noodles to a medium heat

Add the chopped spring onion and remaining soy sauce to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and stir together until fully combined

Tip: Add a small splash of starchy noodle water if you need to loosen the noodles

Once combined, remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped coriander – these are your coriander noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy chilli beef over the coriander noodles

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
