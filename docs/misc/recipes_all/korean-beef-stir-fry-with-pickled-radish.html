Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over the highest heat

Once your pan is very hot, add the beef strips and cook for 1 min exactly, to sear the outside, but prevent them from overcooking

Tip: You'll finish cooking these in the sauce later

Once done, transfer the beef strips to a plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil (there should be some juices leftover from the beef strips), add the sliced shallot, garlic and ginger and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Meanwhile, grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (skin on)

Once softened, add the grated apple then the mirin and cook for 2-3 min or until the apple starts to break down</p><br><br>
