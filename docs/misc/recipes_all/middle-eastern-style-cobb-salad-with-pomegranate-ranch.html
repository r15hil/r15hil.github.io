<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your baharat and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and half your white wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Tip: This will prevent the egg from cracking!

Bring to the boil over a high heat and once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for the perfect, mid-boiled egg

Fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate, then slice into quarters

Add the pomegranate quarters to a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and set half of them aside for later

Place the sieve with the remaining pomegranate seeds over a bowl

Crush the seeds with a fork to release the pomegranate juice

Tip: Lay a piece of cling film over the sieve to prevent mess!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and grate your garlic

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred it finely

Peel the cooled egg[s] and cut into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the pomegranate juice and tahini in a bowl with your mayo and grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!)

Add half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) and the remaining white wine vinegar and give it a good mix up – this is your tahini & pomegranate ranch dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are golden and crisp, remove the tray[s] from the oven, crumble your feta over and drizzle with the remaining honey

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until the feta is slightly melted and golden – these are your feta & honey roast potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, layer the chopped tomato, shredded lettuce, egg quarters and the feta & honey roast potatoes in rows

Sprinkle your ground sumac and the remaining pomegranate seeds over everything – this is your Middle Eastern-style cobb salad

Serve the tahini & pomegranate ranch dressing to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
