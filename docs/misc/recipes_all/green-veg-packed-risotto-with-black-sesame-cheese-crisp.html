<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water

Once the onion is beginning to soften, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Add the halved broccoli to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until tender with a slight bite

Wash your spinach then add to a colander

Once tender, drain the broccoli over the spinach so that it starts to wilt – this is your cooked spinach & broccoli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the cooked spinach and broccoli stems (save the florets for later!) to a food processor with your basil and the remaining chopped garlic

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice of half your lemon with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your green veg sauce

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Sprinkle your grated cheese onto a baking paper-lined baking tray into 1 circle per person and top with your black sesame seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried oregano

Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until golden

Once golden, set aside to cool – this is your black sesame cheese crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the risotto is cooked through, add the green veg sauce to the pan with your soft cheese, broccoli florets and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min – this is your green veg-packed risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Break the black sesame cheese crisp into shards</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the green veg-packed risotto and top with the black sesame cheese crisp shards

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
