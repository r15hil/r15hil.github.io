<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your soy sauce, mirin, Chinese rice wine, agave, and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar

Increase the heat to high and cook for 1-2 min further, stirring constantly, or until thickened

Once thickened, pour into a bowl and keep to one side – this is your teriyaki sauce (wipe the pan clean and save it for later!)

Tip: The sauce will thicken more as it cools!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until crisp and cooked through

Meanwhile, drain your tofu and cut into 3 slices lengthways per person, then pat each one thoroughly dry with kitchen paper

Add your cornflour to a plate

Press each tofu slice into the cornflour firmly, until evenly coated all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once the pan is hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned and crispy

While the tofu is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tofu is crispy, reduce the heat to low and add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> teriyaki sauce (you'll use the rest later!), stirring to coat each tofu slice – this is your crispy teriyaki tofu

Once the broccoli is cooked, add your toasted sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds to the tray and give everything a good mix up – this is your sesame broccoli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy teriyaki tofu with the sticky rice and sesame broccoli to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Spoon the remaining teriyaki sauce over the tofu

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
