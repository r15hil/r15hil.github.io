<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the drained tofu into large chunks

Add the torn tofu to a large bowl with your gluten free soy sauce, cornflour and a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until the tofu is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu to the pan and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] in half lengthways, then slice finely

Once hot, add the sliced courgette and cherry tomatoes to the pot and cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water

Add your tomato paste and red Thai curry paste – this is your Thai stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the courgette is tender, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your garam masala, curry powder and ground turmeric to the pot

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant then add the Thai stock with a small pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has thickened – this is your yellow Thai curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy tofu over the yellow Thai curry with the cooked rice to the side

Tear your coriander roughly over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
