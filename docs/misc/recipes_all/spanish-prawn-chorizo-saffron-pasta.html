<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Cut the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add the diced chorizo and chopped pepper

Cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper starts to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the quick cook amorini to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked amorini, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper is starting to soften, add the saffron, roasted garlic paste, smoked paprika and tomato paste

Give everything a good mix up, then drain the king prawns and add them to the pan with the soft cheese

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Spanish-style king prawn, chorizo & saffron pasta with a good grind of black pepper

Top with the pea shoots and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
