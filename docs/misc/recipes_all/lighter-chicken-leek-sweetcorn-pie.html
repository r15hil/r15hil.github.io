<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your gravy base mix to a heatproof measuring jug with a pinch of salt and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water

Put it in the microwave and cook for 30-40 secs or until thickened and give everything a good mix up – this is your gravy stock

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for 6-7 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised

Once caramelised, add your garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Add your pulled chicken and any remaining juices to the pan with the drained sweetcorn and gravy stock

Give everything a good mix up and remove from the heat – this is your pie filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the pie filling to an oven-proof dish

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

Top the pie filling with the mashed potato

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is bubbling and the mash is golden – this is your chicken & sweetcorn pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the pie is almost cooked, reboil a full kettle

Cut your broccoli into small florets, discard the stem[s] and leaves

Add the broccoli florets to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 4-5 min or until tender

Once done, drain, return to the pot, add a pinch of salt and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken & sweetcorn pie with the cooked broccoli to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
