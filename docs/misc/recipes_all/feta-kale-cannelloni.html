<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot of boiled water over a high heat with a drizzle of&nbsp;olive oil&nbsp;


Once boiling, add the lasagne sheets one at a time with a drizzle of olive oil in between them&nbsp;(this prevents them sticking together)


Cook them for 5-7 min or until they've softened but not fully cooked and once drained, lay the lasagne sheets out separately, so they don't overlap each other

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip the kale leaves from&nbsp;their tough inner stalks and chop them finely, discarding the stalks


Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the shallot&nbsp;and cook for 3 min or until softened


Add the garlic and&nbsp;kale


Cover with a lid and cook for 5 min or until the kale has wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter to a pot over a medium heat


Once melted, add 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour and stir for 2-3 min until a sandy coloured paste is formed - this is your roux


Stir 400ml <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span>&nbsp;milk gradually into the roux


Whisk&nbsp;constantly for 4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then remove from the heat, add the&nbsp;basil&nbsp;stalks and a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar&nbsp;and set aside


Crumble the feta into the softened&nbsp;kale&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Lightly oil an oven-proof dish&nbsp;


Divide the kale and feta mixture&nbsp;between the lasagne sheets, then roll the filled lasagne sheets&nbsp;up tightly like a cigar - this is your canelloni&nbsp;


Add the canelloni to your oven-proof&nbsp;dish with the seams facing down, pour the sauce over and top with the grated cheddar&nbsp;


Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the cherry&nbsp;tomatoes in half&nbsp;


Strip the mint leaves from their stems


Chop the mint and&nbsp;basil leaves together, roughly


Mix the chopped&nbsp;tomatoes and&nbsp;chopped herbs&nbsp;together with a splash of olive oil and a&nbsp;pinch of&nbsp;salt and pepper - this is your side salad


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, allow the cannelloni&nbsp;to cool slightly before serving as it will be extremely hot


Serve with the salad to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
