<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle and rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add your quinoa to a large pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Cut the lemon[s] in half

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>
