<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into quarters, lengthways


Tip:&nbsp;waxy potatoes come in varying sizes so if yours are particularly big, cut them into smaller wedges

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Pat the salmon dry and season it lightly with salt


Heat a pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tsp<span style="color: #e86754;"> [2 tsp]&nbsp;</span>vegetable oil over a high heat


Once very hot, add the salmon, skin-side down


Cook for 2 min, then transfer the salmon (skin-side up) to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Put the salmon in the oven for 7 min or until cooked through (it will turn opaque and flake&nbsp;easily with a fork&nbsp;when cooked)


Meanwhile, slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;finely, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Chop the dill finely, including the stalks&nbsp;

Combine the cucumber and chopped spring onion</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
