<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves then top, tail and slice roughly

Peel and chop your shallot[s] into wedges

Add the sliced leek and shallot wedges to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Roughly chop your creamed coconut (if required!)

Add the chopped sweet potato and chopped creamed coconut to the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour, ground turmeric, curry powder, fish sauce and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the dish and give everything a stir

Add 450ml <span class="text-purple">[590ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[760ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, top with your basa fillet[s] and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until the fish is cooked through and the sweet potato has softened – this is your coconut & lime chowder

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice), then cut into wedges

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Remove the coconut & lime chowder from the oven and flake the cooked basa with a fork – this is your all-in-one coconut & lime basa chowder</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, stir your cultured coconut and the juice of half the<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] through the all-in-one coconut & lime basa chowder

Garnish with your crispy onions and remaining lime wedges
