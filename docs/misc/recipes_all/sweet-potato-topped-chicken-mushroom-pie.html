<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, add your soft cheese, Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your pie filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the pie filling to an oven-proof dish

Top with the mashed sweet potato (reserve the pan!) and sprinkle over the panko breadcrumbs

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your sweet potato-topped chicken & mushroom pie

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pie is cooking, wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Add the sliced spring greens to the reserved sweet potato pan and cover with boiling water and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min until tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the sweet potato-topped chicken & mushroom pie to stand for 5 min then serve with the sliced spring greens to the side

Winner!</p><br><br>
