Add 60g <span class="text-danger">(120g)</span> of flour&nbsp;

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wet your hands and divide the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">(12)</span> balls (slightly smaller than a golf ball)


Return the reserved pan back to a medium heat with a knob of butter and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of vegetable oil


When hot, add the dumplings and cook for 5 min until crispy and golden on each side (use tongs for more control)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
