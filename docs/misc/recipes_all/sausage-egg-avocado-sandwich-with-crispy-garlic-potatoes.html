<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add chopped potatoes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with the chopped garlic, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy garlic potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine your cider vinegar with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sausage patty[ies] to the pan and cook for 5 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once the patty[ies] is almost cooked through, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat, once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking (give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until hot and crusty

Carefully slice in half before serving

Add the salad to the bowl of dressing and toss until fully coated – this is your zingy salad

Season the fried egg[s] with a grind of black pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Divide your smashed avocado between the warmed ciabatta base and lid

Top the base with a handful of zingy salad, a sausage patty, a fried egg and the warmed ciabatta lid – this is your sausage, egg & avocado sandwich</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage, egg & avocado sandwich with the crispy garlic potatoes and remaining zingy salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
