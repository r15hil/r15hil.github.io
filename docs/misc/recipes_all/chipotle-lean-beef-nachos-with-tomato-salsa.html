<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dissolve your beef stock mix and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 125ml <span class="text-purple">[165ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[225ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your lean beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the beef is browning, stack your tortillas and slice them into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, add 2/3 of the diced red onion (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add half the chopped tomato (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with the chipotle stock, drained black beans and a grind of black pepper and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4-5 min or the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your chipotle lean beef mix

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining diced red onion and remaining chopped tomato in a small bowl with the chopped coriander, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato salsa

Once the tortillas have browned, divide into 1 pile per person, spoon over the chipotle lean beef mix and top with the grated cheese

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your chipotle lean beef nachos</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chipotle lean beef nachos and garnish with the tomato salsa

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
