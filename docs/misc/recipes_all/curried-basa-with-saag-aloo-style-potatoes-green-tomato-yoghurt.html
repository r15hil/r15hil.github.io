<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until almost fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once lightly golden, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your curried basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the basa is cooking, combine your yoghurt with your green tomato chutney and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl

Stir it all together – this is your green tomato yoghurt

Wash your spinach and shake off any excess water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are almost fork-tender, add your spinach and blanched peas to the pot

Cook for 1 min or until the spinach has wilted, then drain and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add a knob of butter to the reserved pot with your ginger & garlic paste, black mustard seeds, ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt

Cook over a medium heat for 30 secs or until fragrant, then add the drained potatoes, spinach and peas and give everything a good mix up

Crush some of the potatoes lightly with a fork – these are your saag aloo-style potatoes

Tip: Just crush them gently, or they'll turn to mash!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your curried basa with the saag aloo-style potatoes to the side

Sprinkle your toasted almonds and nigella seeds over the basa

Add a dollop of green tomato yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
