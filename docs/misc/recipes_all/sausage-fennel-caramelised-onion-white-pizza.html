<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Put a large baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Add the dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> warm water and 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt to the pan, then reduce the heat to low

Cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, peel and chop (or grate!) the garlic

Combine the chopped garlic and soft cheese in a separate bowl with half the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!), a splash of milk and a generous grind of black pepper

Stir it all together – this is your white sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast mixture

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough ball out onto a floured work surface and cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Press each dough ball in the centre and push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with flour as you go to stop it sticking!

Keep going until your base is approx. 18-20cm in diameter – these are your pizza bases

Remove the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven (careful the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> will be hot!)</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/Step-6-1675780965604-x200.jpg' alt='Step 6 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the pizza bases to the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then spread the white sauce over the bases

Tear over the sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) in very small pieces, then top with the fennel seeds (not a fan of aniseed? Only add a little!) and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Drizzle the crusts with a little olive oil, then put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 12-15 min or until the crust has puffed up and browned and the sausage is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are cooking, slice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into rounds

Wash the baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad and tomato rounds to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad

Once the onion is caramelised, add the balsamic vinegar and honey and cook for 5-6 min or until the sauce is sticky and glossy – this is your balsamic-glazed onion</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the pizzas with the balsamic-glazed onion – these are your sausage, fennel & caramelised onion white pizzas

Drizzle over any remaining glaze from the pan

Serve the salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
