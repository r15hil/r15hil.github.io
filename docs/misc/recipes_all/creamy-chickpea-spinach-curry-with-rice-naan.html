<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse your chickpeas

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 125ml <span class="text-purple">[160ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[225ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the drained chickpeas, coconut stock and spinach to the pan

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your creamy chickpea & spinach curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the curry is cooking, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, add a little knob of butter to the warmed naan once it's out of the toaster</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the cooked rice with the creamy chickpea & spinach curry

Serve the warmed naan to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
