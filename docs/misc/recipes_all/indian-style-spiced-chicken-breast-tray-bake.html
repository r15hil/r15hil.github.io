<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and add to a large bowl with your curry powder, half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your chicken breast portions and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated in the marinade, then refrigerate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once everything has been cooking for 30 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, push the chicken to one side then add the spinach

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 5 min or until the spinach has wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Indian-style spiced chicken breast</p><br><br>

Once everything is cooked, remove the Indian-style spiced chicken breast from the tray[s] and stir the wilted spinach through the potatoes and onion wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indian-style spiced chicken breast with the potato, spinach & onion wedges to the side

Dollop with the remaining natural yoghurt

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), nigella seeds and lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
