<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Slice your baby button mushrooms finely

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pizzas are cooking, heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the drained cannellini beans to the pot with your chopped tomatoes, Henderson’s Relish, chicken stock mix, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 6-7 min or until thickened – these are your homemade beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully crack your egg[s] into the centre of the pizzas

Return the pizzas to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until the egg whites have set but the yolk is runny and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Full English pizzas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Full English pizzas with the homemade beans to the side

Drizzle your ketchup all over the pizzas

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
