<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once the chicken has begun to brown, add the diced onion and garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the onion has slightly softened</p><br><br>

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<p>Once the tomatoes have softened, add the chopped pepper to the pan with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour and stir everything together

Add your tomato stock to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the pepper is tender with a bite – this is your spicy Cajun-style chicken thigh & pepper stew</p><br><br>
