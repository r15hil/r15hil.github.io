<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your chipotle stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika and ground cumin to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and chipotle stock and cook, covered for 5-7 min or until the beans are soft enough to mash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the black beans are cooking, chop your coriander including the stalks

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop ﬁnely

Trim, then slice the spring onion[s] finely

Once the beans have softened, remove from the heat and add a generous knob of butter, then mash them until smooth – these are your Brazilian-style black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Once hot, add the chopped hake to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side, or until cooked through

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the hake is cooked, add it to a bowl with your mango chutney, sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Zest and juice half your lime[s] into the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty lime hake

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Brazilian-style black beans over the brown rice and top with the zesty lime hake

Garnish with your chopped coriander and lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
