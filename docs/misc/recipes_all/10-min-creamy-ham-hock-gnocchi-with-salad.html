<h4>Step 2</h4>

Boil a kettle


Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat


Trim, then slice the spring onions roughly


Tip: Chop them in a bunch for speed!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi has browned, add the creamy stock and cook, covered, for 2-3 min further or until the gnocchi has softened


Tip: Don't worry if your sauce looks a bit thin, the cheese and ham will thicken it later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the gnocchi has softened, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the ham hock and half the grated Italian hard cheese 


Season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your creamy ham hock gnocchi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy ham hock gnocchi with the baby leaf salad to the side


Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad and sprinkle the gnocchi with the remaining cheese


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
