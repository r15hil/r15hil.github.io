<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240°C/ 220°C (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion softens, drain and rinse your red kidney beans, reserving the liquid

Add half of the drained kidney beans (you'll use the rest later!) to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the skins have burst and are crispy – these are your popped beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the kidney beans are in the oven, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [400ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add the chopped garlic, ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and ground coriander to the onion and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Increase the heat to medium-high, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, then cook for a further 3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock, a generous pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly thickened

Add the remaining drained kidney beans with the reserved kidney bean liquid and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a chilli-like consistency – this is your smoky meat-free mince chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chilli is cooking, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the rice is cooked, stir through the chopped coriander – this is your herby rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky meat-free mince chilli over the herby rice

Garnish with the popped beans and grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
