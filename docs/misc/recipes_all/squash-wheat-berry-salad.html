<p><strong>Description:</strong> Wheatberries are a high fibre, wholegrain. They retain their shape really well and have a nutty flavour, so they're perfect in salads. This roasted butternut squash, red onion, feta and rocket salad is the perfect example of a salad with real bite, topped with mixed seeds. </p>
