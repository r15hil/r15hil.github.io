<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the poached fish to a plate (it's OK if you get some mushrooms)

Add the cooked rice to the poaching liquid, stir to combine - this is your tom kha rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the tom kha rice between your bowls and top with the poached fish

Garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy! (don't eat the lime leaves)</p><br><br>
