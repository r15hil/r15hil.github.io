<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your lemon[s] into wedges (set aside one wedge per person for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine 1/2 tbsp per person of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) in a bowl with your ground turmeric, ground paprika, garam masala and ginger paste

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon juice (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your tikka marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Meanwhile, add your diced chicken breast to the tikka marinade and give everything a good mix up until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook for 10 min, stirring occasionally until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken tikka

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)

Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then dice roughly

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Add the diced cucumber and grated carrot to a bowl with your nigella seeds, a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up – this is your Indian-style salad</p><br><br>

<p>Combine the reserved natural yoghurt with your mint sauce – this is your mint yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warmed naan topped with the chicken tikka and Indian-style salad

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt and garnish with a reserved lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
