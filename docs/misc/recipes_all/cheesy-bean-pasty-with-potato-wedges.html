<p>Meanwhile, dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry (this helps to seal the pastry!)

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, using a fork to crimp along the join

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden, puffed up and cooked through – this is your cheesy bean pasty[ies]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy bean pasty with the potato wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
