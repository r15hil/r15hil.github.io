<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4 min, or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, then cook for a further 3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you’re cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free mince has browned, add your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add your vegetable stock mix, chopped tomatoes and chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>
