<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and curry powder and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve half your chicken stock mix (save the rest for later!), chopped creamed coconut and peanut butter in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your peanut stock

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once lightly browned, add the peanut stock, soy sauce, lime leaf[ves] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has cooked, squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s] into the pan – this is your chicken satay curry

Once the rice is tender, add your shredded kale to the pot and cook for 3-4 min further

Once done, drain and return it to the pot with the remaining chicken stock mix and mix it all together – this is your brown rice & kale

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken satay curry with the brown rice & kale to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
