<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min to coat the grains in the oil

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry

Add your vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20-25 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, drain your jumbo king prawns, then stir them through the rice and cook for 6-7 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your prawns are cooked when they have turned opaque</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!), then cut the zested lemon in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the jumbo prawns are cooked, add the juice of the halved lemon, most of your grated Italian hard cheese (save some for garnish!) and a knob of butter and stir to combine

Season generously with black pepper and add the lemon zest – this is your Amalfi-style risotto with jumbo king prawns

Wash your salad, pat them dry with kitchen paper, then dress them lightly in olive oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your Amalfi-style risotto with jumbo king prawns

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and the dressed salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
