<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways then slice finely

Once the pan is hot, add the sliced courgette with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once the courgette has slightly softened, add your roasted garlic paste, dried oregano and the halved tomatoes

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the tomatoes have started to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi and reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained gnocchi through the Mediterranean-style vegetables and season with pepper

Add the spinach to the pan and stir for 1-2 min until the spinach has wilted – this is your Mediterranean-style vegetable gnocchi

Tip: If the sauce is looking a little dry, add a splash of the reserved starchy cooking water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mediterranean-style vegetable gnocchi in a bowl and garnish with the chopped basil and grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
