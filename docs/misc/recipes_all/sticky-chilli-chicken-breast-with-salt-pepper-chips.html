<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, add your diced chicken breast to a bowl with the cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small cubes

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any remaining oil

Add the chopped pepper, ginger and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your honey, red chilli relish and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

While the sauce thickens, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Once thickened, add the crispy chicken to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the chicken is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky chilli chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, chopped spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray[s] and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky chilli chicken with the salt & pepper chips to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
