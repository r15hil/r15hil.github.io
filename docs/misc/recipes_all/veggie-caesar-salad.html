<p><strong>Description:</strong> A Caesar salad typically combines lettuce, croutons, cheese, egg, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, garlic and black pepper. We've left the anchovies out to make it vegetarian and used capers as a salty, briny replacement, along with green beans and chives. Henderson's relish replaces Worchester sauce because it's vegetarian too!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C/ 160&deg;C (fan)/ 400&deg;F/ Gas 6


Boil a kettle


Rip the ciabatta into small pieces&nbsp;onto one side of a baking tray,&nbsp;drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a big pinch of salt - these are your croutons


Trim the green beans and cut them in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Lay out a piece of foil and put the green beans in the middle


Scrunch up the edges of the foil slightly, then add 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> water and close the parcel tightly


Add the parcel to the other half of the tray and put it in the oven for 15 min, or until the ciabatta has crisped and the green beans are tender with a slight bite&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the eggs to a pot of salted, boiled water over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)&nbsp;


Boil&nbsp;the eggs for exactly 7 min (perfect, mid-boiled eggs)


Meanwhile, fill a bowl of very cold water with ice (Gousto's ice packs are perfect) ready for step 5 &nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop the chives finely


Grate the cheese


Peel the garlic


Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar and Henderson's relish, with 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>olive oil&nbsp;


Grate in&nbsp;the garlic and add half of the cheese and half of the chives - this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the eggs are done, drain and add them to your ice water (this stops them from cooking further)&nbsp;


Tip: no ice? Run them under very cold running water for 3 min and then set aside&nbsp;</p><br><br>

Add the corn salad, capers, remaining chives and cheese


Mix to combine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel the cooled eggs and cut them in half&nbsp;


Remove the croutons and beans from the oven and add them to the bowl


Gently mix the salad&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up the salad into large bowls, put the egg slices on top and drizzle with plenty of dressing


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
