<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a lid with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once melted, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1 min or until starting to sizzle

Once sizzling, add your basmati rice, stirring to coat the grains in the butter and oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the grains are coated, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your jeera rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the sliced pepper and tomato wedges to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan, give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Drain your king prawns

Add the drained king prawns and tomato stock to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the prawns are cooked through – this is your king prawn jalfrezi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the king prawn jalfrezi over the jeera rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
