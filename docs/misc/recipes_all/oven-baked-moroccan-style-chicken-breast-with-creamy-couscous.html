<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil a kettle

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with the tomato wedges, onion wedges and half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!)

Add your ras el hanout, half your ground turmeric (save the rest for later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-22 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is tender – this is your oven baked Moroccan-style chicken breast and roasted veg

Meanwhile, peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid over a high heat

Once hot, add your giant couscous, chicken stock mix, remaining ground turmeric, spinach, grated garlic, a generous pinch of salt and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until the couscous is tender

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems, discard the stems

Once the couscous is tender, stir through the remaining natural yoghurt and tear over the mint leaves

Crumble over half your feta (save the rest for garnish!), season with a very generous grind of black pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your creamy giant couscous</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the creamy giant couscous with the oven baked Moroccan-Style chicken breast and roasted veg

Drizzle over any remaining roasting juices from the tray[s] and crumble over the remaining feta

Dig in!</p><br><br>
