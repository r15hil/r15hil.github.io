Trim, then chop the green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the chopped onion and cook for 2-3 min or until softened and crush the cardamom pod<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Once the onion has softened, add the ground turmeric, curry powder, and crushed cardamom and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water

Once fragrant, add the basmati rice to the pan with the onion and stir to coat in the spices

Add the halved green beans and vegetable stock then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 9-10 min or until most of the water has been absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the eggs to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the eggs from cracking!) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl with very cold water and add the cooked eggs to the bowl

Set aside to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice has had 9-10 min, stir in the blanched peas and the chopped wilted spinach

Increase the heat to medium and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min or until the rice is cooked and the vegetables are warmed through – this is your green bean, spinach & pea vedgeree</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel the cooled eggs and cut them into quarters

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Combine the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon with the mango chutney in a small bowl – this is your lemony mango chutney

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the green bean, spinach & pea vedgeree with the quartered eggs on top and the lemon wedges to the side, discard the cardamom pod<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drizzle the lemony mango chutney all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
