<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Layer 1/3 of the green veggies over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, top with 1/3 of your lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta, then top with 1/3 of the ‘Nduja béchamel

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of 'Nduja béchamel

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish!

Top with the grated cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked – this is your creamy 'Nduja & green veggie lasagne

Combine your white wine vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy ‘Nduja & green veggie lasagne

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
