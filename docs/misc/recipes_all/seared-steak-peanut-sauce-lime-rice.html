<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high


Boil a kettle


Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;taking care not to include any white pith (which is very bitter)


Place the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)


&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the rice, lime zest, 350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid over a high heat and bring to the boil


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water has absorbed


Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until later

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut the broccoli into quarters, lengthways


Cut each quarter again, so you end up with broccoli wedges&nbsp;


Add the wedges to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess)


Drizzle with vegetable oil and season generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Put the tray directly under the grill and cook for 12-15 min or until nicely charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, pat the steaks dry with kitchen towel


Rub them with a little vegetable oil and season generously with salt on both sides


Heat a dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat until very hot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the steaks to the hot pan (in batches if needed) and cook for 1 min on each side (for medium-rare)


Transfer the cooked steaks to a plate and leave to rest


Reserve the pan for the next step&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the peanut butter, coconut cream, soy sauce and 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> sugar (brown, if you have it!) with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water to the reserved pan


Whisk together (off the heat) until smooth


Once smooth, return the pan to a low heat and whisk until a sauce forms (approx. 3-4 min) then remove from the heat and set aside (it will thicken a little as it cools)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, halve the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]&nbsp;</span>


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice the steak as finely as you can (against the grain)


Tip: Cutting against the grain means identifying the natural lines in the steak and cutting in the opposite direction!


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked rice, add the juice of half the <span class="text-danger">[whole]</span> lime and season with salt and pepper


Spoon a pool of peanut sauce on to your plates and top with the sliced steak, serving the lime rice and charred broccoli to the side&nbsp;


Garnish with spring onion and the remaining lime (cut into wedges)</p><br><br>
