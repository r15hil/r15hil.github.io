<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 200ml [300ml] boiled water and stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano and half of the balsamic vinegar – this is your beef stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once browned, add the beef stock, grated carrot and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to the beef mince and cook for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your lean ragù

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the ragù is cooking, melt 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter in the reserved pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually add 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> milk into the roux and whisk for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper – this is your béchamel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained macaroni and Dijon mustard to the béchamel and mix well – this is your macaroni cheese

Transfer the lean ragù to an oven-proof dish (or individual smaller ones!) and top with the macaroni cheese

Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top and put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your lean ragù bake</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and toss through the salad

Serve the lean ragù bake with the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
