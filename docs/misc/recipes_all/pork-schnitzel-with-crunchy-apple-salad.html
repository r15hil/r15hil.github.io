<p><strong>Description:</strong> The concept of a schnitzel dates back to the seventh century, when a Byzantine emperor was such a diva that he demanded his meats to be served between sheets of gold. This version is slightly less opulent, but weâ€™re confident that it would please even the fussiest of emperors.</p>
