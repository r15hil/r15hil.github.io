<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, combine your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Once the onion has softened, add your butternut squash cubes and dried oregano and cook for a further 2-3 min

Add the creamy stock and chopped tomatoes and cook, covered, over a high heat for 5-6 min or until the squash has begun to soften – this is your squash & tomato sauce</p><br><br>
