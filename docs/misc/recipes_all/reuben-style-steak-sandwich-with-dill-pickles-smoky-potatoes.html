<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs, then add to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with your ground smoked paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and mix together

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and cooked through – these are your smoky potatoes</p><br><br>

Once rested, slice the cooked steak as thinly as you can on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stuff your hot ciabatta with the sliced steak, pickled radish slaw and the quick-pickled cucumber rounds

Serve with the smoky potatoes and the dill, cucumber & radish pickles to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
