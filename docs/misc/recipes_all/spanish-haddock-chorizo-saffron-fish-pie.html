<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp

Dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>Knorr vegetable stock cube and the tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

Add the tomato stock and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened slightly

Add the haddock bites, with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon, a grind of pepper and stir it all together – this is your fish pie mix

Transfer the fish pie mix to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add the saffron stock with a splash of milk and a large knob of butter

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper - this is your saffron mash

Top the fish pie mix with the saffron mash

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the mash is golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Spanish haddock, chorizo & saffron fish pie</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the pie is in the oven, re-boil a kettle

Chop the cavolo nero roughly, removing any tough stalks

Add the chopped cavolo nero and green beans to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the tender

Drain and return to the pot, then squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon over the greens - these are your lemony greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, remove the pie from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Serve the Spanish haddock, chorizo & saffron fish pie with the lemony greens to the side

Garnish with the chopped parsley
