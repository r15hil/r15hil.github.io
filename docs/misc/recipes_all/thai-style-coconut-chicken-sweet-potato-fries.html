<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries, then add the fries to a baking tray (or two!) with your toasted sesame seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!) then add it to a bowl with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>boiled water and mix to form a paste – this is your coconut paste

Chop your coconut flakes finely

Add the chopped coconut flakes to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and give it a good mix up – these are your coconutty breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Press the coated chicken into the coconutty breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly

Add the breaded chicken strips to a baking tray (or two!), drizzle them with vegetable oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) and golden – these are your coconutty chicken goujons</p><br><br>

<p>Add the sliced radish to a bowl with half the chopped coriander (save the rest for later), the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime (not a fan of citrus? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar

Give it a good mix up – this is your radish salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your honey to a bowl with your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining chopped coriander and juice of the remaining lime and mix to combine – this is your Thai-style honey dipping sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconutty chicken goujons with the radish salad and sesame sweet potato fries

Serve the Thai-style honey dipping sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
