<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 1-2 min until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is browning, deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic clove open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skin[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander to the dish

Add the shallot quarters, crushed garlic, chopped pepper and tomato wedges with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water and sprinkle in your chicken stock mix

Add your tortiglioni to the dish, mix it all together and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the pasta and chicken are cooked (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Chop your green chilli[es] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pasta is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your soft cheese – this is your creamy fajita-style chicken pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy fajita-style chicken pasta in the centre of the table and top with the grated cheddar

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and season with a grind of black pepper
