<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free mince has browned, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add your hoisin sauce, cornflour and soy sauce with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> water and cook for a further 4 min or until the sauce becomes sticky – this is your spicy hoisin meat-free mince</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the greens are done, remove the parcel[s] from the oven and drain away any excess water

Add them to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil and stir to combine – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy hoisin meat-free mince with the sesame greens and cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
