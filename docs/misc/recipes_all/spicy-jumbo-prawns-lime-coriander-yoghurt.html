<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and boil a kettle

Add most of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried oregano to a large bowl

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and give it a good mix up – this is your spicy marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the spicy marinade and gently mix together until the prawns are fully coated – these are your marinated prawns

Set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the prawns are marinating, rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, for 6-8 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop your cherry tomatoes

Wash and shred your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, remove the stone[s] using a teaspoon, scoop the avocado out of the skin[s] using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways

Add it all to a bowl and give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped coriander, remaining chopped garlic, natural yoghurt and the juice of half your lime[s] to a food processor

Add a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your lime & coriander yoghurt

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the coriander and garlic as finely as you can then mix it all together in a small bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated prawns and cook for 6-7 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your spicy jumbo king prawns

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add a pinch of salt to the cooked quinoa and give it a good mix up

Serve the spicy jumbo king prawns with the quinoa and salad

Drizzle the lime & coriander yoghurt all over and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
