<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut narrow slices (about the width of a pound coin) into your waxy potatoes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – these are your hasselback potatoes

Tip: Place chopsticks either side of the potatoes to stop you cutting all the way through!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the hasselback potatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and drizzle each with olive oil

Season with a generous pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 30-35 min or until tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a microplane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) then chop in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your panko breadcrumbs, traditional Italian pesto, lemon zest and half your grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until fully combined – this is your pesto breadcrumb mixture

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your salmon fillet[s] to a separate, tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Top the salmon with the pesto breadcrumb mixture

Put the tray in the oven for 14-15 min or until the salmon is cooked through and the crumb is crisp and golden – this is your pesto-crusted salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the salmon is cooking, trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender, then drain and return to the pot

Once drained, add the juice of half your zested lemon[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!), a generous knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your buttery green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After the initial 25-30 min, remove the tray[s] with the potatoes from the oven and top with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min or until the cheese has melted and the potatoes are crisp – these are your cheesy hasselback potatoes

Meanwhile, cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pesto-crusted salmon with the buttery green beans and cheesy hasselback potatoes to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
