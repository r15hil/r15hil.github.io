<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish of Spanish chorizo with couscous and Moroccan spice mix, ras el hanout, is a delicious example of how Spanish cuisine has been influenced by North African ingredients.  The bright red colour and distinctive smoky flavour of traditional Spanish chorizo comes from pimento (a.k.a. smoked paprika)</p>
