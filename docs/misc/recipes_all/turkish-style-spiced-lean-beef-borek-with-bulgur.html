<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Add your lean beef mince to a bowl with the diced shallot, your ground cumin, ground coriander, tomato paste and sultanas

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly to combine (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your beef filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper and dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out as thinly as you can into a large rectangle with a rolling pin

Cut it, lengthways, into 1 rectangle per person then place the rectangle[s] end to end and press together firmly so you end up with a long piece

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Make 2!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Spoon the beef filling into the centre of the pastry in an even line, then brush the long edge of the pastry with a little cold water

Fold the pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, then use a fork to crimp along the edge</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Roll the sealed pastry, starting at one end, into a spiral

Transfer the pastry spiral[s] to the lined baking tray

Tip: Leave a 2 cm gap within the spiral so that it can puff up!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Turkish-style spiced lean beef borek</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and stir through your chicken stock mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your natural yoghurt with some of the chopped coriander and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coriander yoghurt

Combine the grated carrot, tomato wedges and remaining chopped coriander with your white wine vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl – this is your carrot & tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Turkish-style spiced lean beef borek with the bulgur, carrot & tomato salad and coriander yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
