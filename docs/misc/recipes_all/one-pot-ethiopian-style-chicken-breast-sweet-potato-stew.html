<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your oven-proof dishes and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover with tin foil</p><br><br>

<p>Bring to boil over a high heat then cover the dish with a lid

Put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
