<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is starting to brown, add the sliced shallot, tomato paste, ginger & garlic paste, curry powder, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chicken stock mix and tortiglioni to the dish with a small pinch of salt and 500ml <span class="text-purple">[750ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water

Nestle the tortiglioni into the water as much as you can, then stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once cooked, remove the dish from the oven and add the spinach, clotted cream, garam masala and a very generous knob of butter

Gently stir until the spinach starts to wilt – this is your one-pot butter chicken tortiglioni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot butter chicken tortiglioni and garnish with a good crack of black pepper

Dig in!</p><br><br>
