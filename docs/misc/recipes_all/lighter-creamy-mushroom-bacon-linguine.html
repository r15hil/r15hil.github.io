<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Slice the chestnut mushrooms

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, and boil a full kettle

Once hot, add the bacon lardons and sliced mushrooms and cook for 8-10 min or until the bacon is cooked through and crisp, then transfer to a plate (reserve the pan for later!) – these are your crispy lardons & mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the linguine is cooking, peel and roughly chop the garlic

Dissolve the chicken stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water and add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> milk

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim the end from the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>keeping the stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> intact

Without cutting through the stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, carefully slice the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into thin strips, lengthways (at approx. 5mm intervals)

Then peel lengths of the sliced courgette until you have a pile of ’courgetti’

Tip: Have a spiraliser? Use this instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pan with any cooking juices and add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cannellini beans and cook for 2-3 min until the beans are starting to colour

Add the chicken stock and cook for 1-2 min further

Transfer to a food processor (reserving the pan) and blitz until smooth – this is your creamy bean sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add the cooked linguine, courgetti and crispy lardons & mushrooms

Add the creamy bean sauce with a pinch of salt and pepper and give it a good mix up until everything is coated in the sauce – this is your 'creamy' bacon & mushroom linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it looks a little thick</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the 'creamy' bacon & mushroom linguine and garnish with the chopped chives and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
