<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the zest of your lime[s] (try to avoid the white pith, as this is very bitter!) to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, cayenne pepper (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), ground allspice, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix – this is your Caribbean-style crumb</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add your smoked basa fillet[s] to the baking tray[s] and top evenly with the Caribbean-style crumb

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the crumb is golden – this is your Caribbean-style smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Cut your lime[s] in half

Add your mango chutney, the juice of half of your lime and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Caribbean-style smoky basa with the sweet potato mash and tomato salsa to the side

Garnish with the sliced spring onion greens and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
