<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the farfalle for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your diced chorizo to a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to crisp

Once crispy, transfer to a small bowl and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chorizo is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the drained farfalle, creamy chicken stock and crispy chorizo to the pan

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the farfalle is evenly coated in the sauce – this is your smoky chorizo & pepper farfalle

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chorizo & pepper farfalle

Top with the grated cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
