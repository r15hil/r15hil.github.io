<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min  to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Slice your chestnut mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced mushrooms, crushed garlic, drained sweetcorn and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the dish

Add your chicken stock mix with 600ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> [1.2L] </span>boiled water, your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and soy sauce

Stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 20 min or until everything's cooked through (no pink meat!) and tender

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] and set aside for serving

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 20 min, remove the dish from the oven, give everything a stir and add your medium egg noodles

Tip: Nestle the noodles into the sauce for even cooking!

Cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for 10-12 min further or until the noodles are tender – these are your one-pot spicy chicken breast, mushroom & sweetcorn noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot spicy chicken breast, mushroom & sweetcorn noodles and drizzle your toasted sesame oil all over

Garnish with the sliced spring onion and toasted sesame seeds
