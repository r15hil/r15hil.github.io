<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely slice your ginger, then chop into matchsticks as finely as you can

Combine your black bean paste with 25ml <span class="text-purple">[35ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[45ml]</span> cold water and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar – this is your black bean sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your basa fillet[s] to a plate and drizzle your soy sauce all over

Turn the basa several times until the soy sauce fully soaks into the fish

Sprinkle your cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated, then set aside for later

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut a large piece of tin foil approx. the size of A3 paper (or two!) and to a baking tray

Lay the spinach, Tenderstem broccoli and half of the sliced ginger and garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in the middle with your toasted sesame oil and black bean sauce

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the vegetables to form a<span class="text-danger"> </span>sealed parcel[s], then put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until tender – these are your black bean greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining sliced ginger and garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until crispy

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once crispy, transfer to a bowl and set aside – this is your crispy ginger & garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan)

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden, crisp and cooked through – this is your crispy soy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy soy basa with the cooked rice and black bean greens to the side and pour any remaining black bean sauce over the greens

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Sprinkle the crispy ginger & garlic and sliced spring onion over the crispy soy basa and rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
