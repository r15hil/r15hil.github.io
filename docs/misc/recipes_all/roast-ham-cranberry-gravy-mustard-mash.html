<h4>Step 7</h4>

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper


Stir the wholegrain mustard through the mash – this is your mustard mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the roast ham finely


Serve the sliced ham over the mustard mash with the en papillote carrots and cranberry gravy to the side


Tip: Remove the cloves from your carrots before serving
