<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your pork & beef mince to the dish and break it up with a wooden spoon

Peel and grate your garlic

Add your tomato paste, grated garlic and a knob of butter to the dish and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock mix, balsamic vinegar and 650ml <span class="text-purple">[850ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat, season generously with salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min – this is your pork & beef ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After 30 min, remove the pork & beef ragù from the oven

Break your spaghetti in half and add it to the dish, giving everything a good mix up to separate the strands

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for a final 25 min or until the spaghetti is tender and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your all-in-one pork & beef ragù spaghetti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the ragù is almost done, slice your tomato[es] finely and add to a bowl

Roughly tear half your basil leaves over the top (save the rest for later!)

Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper – this is your tomato & basil salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, give the all-in-one pork & beef ragù spaghetti a good mix up with a fork to separate the strands of pasta and sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese all over

Roughly tear the remaining basil leaves over the top

Serve the tomato & basil salad to the side
