<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle, then peel and finely slice half your brown onion[s] and grate the rest

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely grate your ginger, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and grated onion to a bowl with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), your ground coriander and a pinch of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 5 meatballs per person

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, until browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Dissolve your white miso paste and soy sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your miso stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once browned, transfer the meatballs to a plate, leaving the pan on a medium heat

Add the sliced onion and sliced mushrooms and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the grated ginger and remaining chopped garlic with your toasted sesame oil and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, stir in your cornflour and miso stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for a final 13-15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your ginger & miso pork meatball sauce</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine your rice vinegar with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl

Add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the basmati rice in bowls topped with the ginger & miso pork meatball sauce and quick-pickled slaw

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
