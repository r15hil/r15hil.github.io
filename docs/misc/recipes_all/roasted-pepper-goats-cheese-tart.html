<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips (as finely as you can)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the pepper strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 10 min or until the peppers begin to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the discs to a separate baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, unroll your puff pastry and cut it into 1 square per person

Transfer the pastry square[s] to a sheet of non-stick baking paper (the size of a baking tray)

Score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife and prick the inside of the border all over with a fork (this will stop you getting a soggy bottom!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the peppers have softened, remove them from the oven

Top the centre of the pastry squares with the softened peppers and transfer them (on the baking paper) to a baking tray

Tip: Use the same baking tray the peppers were on to save on washing up!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the pastry is golden and crisp and the edges have puffed up – these are your roasted pepper tarts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the roasted pepper tarts are cooking, combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Crumble your goats' cheese into small bite-sized pieces

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the roasted pepper tarts with the crumbled goats' cheese and season them with black pepper

Serve the roasted pepper & goats' cheese tarts with the crispy potatoes and a handful of salad to the side

Drizzle the dressing over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
