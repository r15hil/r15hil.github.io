<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray

Drizzle with vegetable oil, add the ground turmeric with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp and cooked through – these are your turmeric roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> red onion

Slice the remaining onion as finely as you can

Dice the tomatoes

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

While the onion softens, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic with the ground cumin, ground coriander and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the tomato paste and vegetable stock mix to the pan

Add the plant-based mince (remove the paper if required!), increase the heat to high and cook for a further 4-5 min or until it's starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free mince keema pav between the buttered brioche buns with the turmeric roast potatoes and tomato & red onion salad to the side

Garnish the meat-free mince keema pav with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)
