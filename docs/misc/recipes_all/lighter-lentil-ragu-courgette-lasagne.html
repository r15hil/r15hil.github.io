<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 25ml <span class="text-purple">[30ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40ml] </span>boiled water

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the veg has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained lentils, chopped tomatoes and savoury stock to the pan

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your lentil ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, melt 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 50ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 3-4 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Add your soft cheese, grated Italian hard cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper (Tip: Add a little water if the sauce is looking a little thick!) – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Layer some of the lentil ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with the courgette discs

Cover with the béchamel sauce, top with the grated lighter cheese and cook in the oven for 15-20 min or until bubbling and golden – this is your cheesy lentil & courgette bake

While the bake is cooking, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the cheesy lentil & courgette bake to stand for a few min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the cheesy lentil & courgette bake with the salad to the side and drizzle with a little olive oil and your balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
