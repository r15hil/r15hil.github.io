<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps

Wash your fruit and veg

Note: equipment and pan sizes vary. Ensure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 6 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy noodle water and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail, and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your white cup mushrooms finely

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up & slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the grated carrot, sliced mushroom and sliced spring greens to the pan and cook for 4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel and grate your garlic

Combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated garlic, soy sauce and a splash of cold water in a small bowl – this is your gochujang stir-fry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, add the drained noodles with the gochujang stir-fry sauce and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min further, stirring until the sauce sticks to the noodles – this is your Korean-style chicken noodle stir-fry

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Korean-style chicken noodle stir-fry

Garnish with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
