<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and approx. 1cm in thickness</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your panko breadcrumbs with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt on a large plate

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Add the lemon zest to the breadcrumbs and give everything a good mix up – these are your lemony breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of the lemon[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then stir it all together

Dip the flattened chicken in the lemon & olive oil, then press firmly into the lemony breadcrumbs until both sides are well coated

Add the coated chicken to an oiled baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your lemony chicken Milanese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Pick your basil leaves from their stems and finely chop, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 5 min until softened, then add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further

Add your chopped tomatoes with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> water, your chicken stock mix and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> </span>sugar then bring to the boil over a high heat

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the sauce is cooking, add your wholewheat spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving the pot

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the spinach and cook for 1-2 min or until wilted

Drain off any excess liquid and season with a pinch of salt

Stir the chopped basil into the tomato sauce

Slice the lemony chicken Milanese on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomato sauce over the spaghetti with the sliced lemony chicken Milanese on top and the wilted spinach to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
