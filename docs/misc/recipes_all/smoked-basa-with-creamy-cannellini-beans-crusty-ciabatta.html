<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel, then slice your shallot[s] roughly

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, Dijon mustard and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your creamy Dijon stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse your cannellini beans

Once the shallot has slightly softened, add the drained cannellini beans and chopped green beans to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the beans have begun to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beans are slightly softened, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the creamy Dijon stock to the pan and top with the chopped smoked basa and a crack of black pepper

Cook, covered, for 5 min or until your fish is cooked through – this is your smoked basa with creamy cannellini beans

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until hot and crusty

Spread a little butter over the crusty ciabatta[s] and cut into triangles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa with creamy cannellini beans with the crusty ciabatta to the side

Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
