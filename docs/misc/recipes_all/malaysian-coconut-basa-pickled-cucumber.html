<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped basa to a bowl, sprinkle over half your ground turmeric (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and set aside until later – this is your marinated basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the basa is marinating, cut your cucumber[s] in half lengthways and then slice finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and chop the softer inner core[s] finely

Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Put everything into a food processor

Chop half your red chilli[es] roughly and add to the food processor (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), then finely slice the rest into rounds (save these for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your flaked almonds and remaining ground turmeric to the food processor with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Add your soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of sugar

Pulse until you're left with a slightly chunky paste – this is your Malaysian-style spice paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add the Malaysian-style spice paste to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tamarind paste with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the marinated basa and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the basa is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Once the basa is cooked, add the chopped creamed coconut to the pan and cook for 1 min further – this is your Malaysian-style coconut basa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Malaysian-style coconut basa with the basmati rice and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
