<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Roll the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half

<p>Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span><span class="text-danger">,</span> then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Cut the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and slice finely


Slice the radishes as finely as you can into thin rounds


Combine the carrot ribbons, sliced cucumber and radishes with the Vietnamese dressing and a pinch of salt&nbsp;in a large bowl&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the&nbsp;chicken&nbsp;is cooked, transfer it to a plate and leave the pan over a medium heat (no need to give it a clean!)


Add the soy sauce sachets&nbsp;and&nbsp;honey&nbsp;and cook for 2-3 min, stirring all the time, until the sauce has thickened and is sticky


Once sticky, remove the pan from the heat, return the chicken to the pan and turn it in the glaze until it's fully coated</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the chicken and serve over the brown rice with the salad to the side


Garnish with the chopped mint,&nbsp;coriander, spring onion&nbsp;and crushed peanuts&nbsp;
