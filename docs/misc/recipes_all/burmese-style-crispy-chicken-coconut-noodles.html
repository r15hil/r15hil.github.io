<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine your diced chicken thigh with half of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) in a large bowl and mix it all together – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your gram flour and ground smoked paprika in a separate bowl with your ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a small pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your gram flour mix

Reserve 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 1/2 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tsp] </span>of gram flour mix, then add the remaining gram flour mix with the marinated chicken and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until the chicken is crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and the reserved gram flour mix and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 600ml<span class="text-purple"> [900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and the remaining soy sauce to the pot with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a small pinch of salt

Whisk everything together until there are no lumps – this is your coconut broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your fine egg noodles and mooli slaw mix to the coconut broth, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min further or until the noodles are tender

Once tender, add the juice of half your lime[s] and stir it all together – these are your Burmese-style coconut noodles

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Burmese-style coconut noodles in a bowl and top with the crispy chicken and chopped coriander

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
