<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil a kettle

Cut your cauliflower[s] into small florets, slice the stem[s] and leaves finely

Add the cauliflower florets to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook the florets for 4-5 min or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once done, drain, the cauliflower florets, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[220ml]</span> vegetable water and transfer the cooked florets to an oven-proof dish

Reserve the pot

Meanwhile, grate your cheddar flavour block

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat, once hot add a large knob of butter alternative

Once melted, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk the reserved vegetable water into the roux, a little at a time, then add your creamy single oat and half the grated cheeze (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your cheezy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the drained cannellini beans and sliced stem[s] & leaves to the sauce with your umami seasoning and vegetable stock mix

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheezy bean mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pour the cheezy bean mixture over the cauliflower, making sure everything's covered

Cover the dish with tin foil and put it in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the cauliflower is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the cauliflower is in the oven, combine your panko breadcrumbs, truffle oil, crispy onions and remaining cheeze in a small bowl

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your truffle & crispy onion breadcrumbs

Wash your baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Top with the truffle & crispy onion breadcrumbs and return it to the oven for a final 8-10 min or until golden – this is your plant-based truffle cauli cheeze & cannellini bean gratin

While the gratin is cooking, combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil – this is your dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based truffle cauli cheeze & cannellini bean gratin with the baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle the dressing over the salad and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
