<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Discard the outer green pods and add the cardamom seeds to a pestle & mortar (or food processor!) with the cumin seeds and grind into a coarse powder

Add the chopped garlic (don't like raw garlic? Go easy!), chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and coriander with a pinch salt and grind to a paste

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a splash of water and stir it all together – this is your zhoug</p><br><br>

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to the oven for a final 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are golden</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the nigella chicken & roasted vegetables with the zhoug drizzled over the top
