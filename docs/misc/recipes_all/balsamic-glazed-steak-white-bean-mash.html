<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Bring the pot to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until fork-tender&nbsp;


Once cooked, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter and splash of milk, then cover and set aside until step 7&nbsp;


Tip: Covering the hot, cooked potatoes encourages them to steam and they will mash more easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pan is very hot, add the steaks and cook for 1 min on one side only


Flip the steak and add the balsamic vinegar with a pinch of sugar (this helps it caramelise)&nbsp;


Cook for 1 min further, then transfer the cooked steaks (with any remaining balsamic) to a plate and cover with a tea towel to 'rest' until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Mash the potatoes until smooth and season very generously with salt and pepper


Rinse and drain the cannellini beans and add them to the mash


Place the pot over a medium-low heat and cook for 3 min or until the beans are warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Chop the basil finely, including the stalks&nbsp;


Serve the steak along with any resting juices and excess balsamic over the mash with the courgette and tomato to the side


Scatter over the basil


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
