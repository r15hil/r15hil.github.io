<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once crispy, add your honey to the pan with a crack of black pepper

Mix it all together and cook for a further 30 secs or until the halloumi is golden and sticky – this is your halloumi saganaki

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Do this is in batches

When everything's nearly ready, add your sourdough pitta to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Add the reserved drained chickpeas

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted veg mix</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Chop the warmed sourdough pitta into quarters

Serve the hummus on a plate with the roasted veg mix, halloumi saganaki, salad and pitta quarters to the side

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper to the hummus and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
