<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle and peel lengths off your courgette[s] with a peeler until you end up with a pile of courgette ribbons

Combine your ground turmeric with a generous pinch of salt, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water in a heatproof bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved

Add your rice vinegar and courgette ribbons and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled courgette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers (save them for later) and chop the softer inner core[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> cold water and tough outer lemongrass layers, bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the sliced onion (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 3-4 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the onion and increase the heat to high

Cook for 5-7 min or until beginning to crisp, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once crisp, add your fish sauce and red chilli relish and cook for 2-3 min further or until everything is brown, sticky and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Watch it like a hawk to prevent the sauce from burning!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Carefully chop your roasted peanuts roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped peanuts, chopped ginger and chopped lemongrass to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Remove the lemongrass outer layers from the rice and discard, then fluff the cooked rice with a fork and stir your black sesame seeds through – this is your black sesame rice

Stir the chopped mint and coriander through the pork – this is your Vietnamese-style sticky lemongrass lean pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the grated carrot and remaining sliced onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your carrot salad

Drain the quick-pickled courgette, discard the liquid

Serve the Vietnamese-style sticky lemongrass lean pork with the black sesame rice, quick-pickled courgette and carrot salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
