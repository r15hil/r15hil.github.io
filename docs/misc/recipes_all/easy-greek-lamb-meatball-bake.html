<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your lamb mince, half of the grated onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape the lamb mince into 3 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs and cook for 3-4 min, turning occasionally, until they're browned all over

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside (these will finish cooking in the sauce later!), then return the pan to a medium-low heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Once the pan is hot, add the grated carrot and remaining grated onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-5 min or until softened

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the chopped tomatoes, dried oregano, beef stock and a pinch of sugar to the pan and cook for 8-10 min or until reduced to a thick sauce

Once thickened, transfer the sauce to an oven-proof dish and add the lamb meatballs

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min until the sauce is bubbling and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek-style lamb meatball bake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the meatballs are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt

Cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the bulgur wheat is cooking, roughly crumble your Greek cheese on a clean chopping board

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Greek-style lamb meatball bake over the bulgur wheat

Sprinkle over the Greek cheese and chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
