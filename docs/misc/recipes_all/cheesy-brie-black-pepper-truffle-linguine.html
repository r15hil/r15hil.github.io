<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to turn very slightly golden

Once done, transfer to kitchen paper (use a fork to get them out of the oil) and set aside

Season with a pinch of salt – these are your truffled garlic crisps

Reserve the pan and the oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy brie, black pepper & truffle linguine topped with the cheese shavings and truffled garlic crisps

Drizzle the remaining truffle oil all over and season with a grind of black pepper

Toss the rocket and grapes together and drizzle with the balsamic dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
