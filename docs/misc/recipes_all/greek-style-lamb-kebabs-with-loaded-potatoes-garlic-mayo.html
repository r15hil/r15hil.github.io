<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop the potatoes into small, bite-sized pieces

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes and chopped tomato to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the potatoes are lightly golden - these are your roast potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel and finely chop half the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Slice the remaining shallot finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine half the chopped garlic, half the dried oregano (you'll use the rest later!) with the lamb mince, chopped shallot, ground cinnamon, dried thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a medium bowl

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your lamb mixture

Divide the lamb mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and press it onto each skewer to form a long sausage shape – these are your lamb skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lamb skewers to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned – these are your Greek-style lamb kebabs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the potatoes have had an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and top with the Greek-style lamb kebabs

Return the tray to the oven for 10-15 min or until the kebabs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the cucumber into rounds (as finely as you can!), then add them to a medium bowl with the remaining oregano, sliced shallot, white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your oregano cucumber salad

Combine the mayo, remaining chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous crack of black pepper – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the roast potatoes to a plate and top with the oregano cucumber salad

Serve the Greek-style lamb kebabs to the side and drizzle the garlic mayo all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
