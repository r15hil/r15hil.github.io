<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-9 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don’t stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to soften, remove the pan from the heat and add the spinach with your sun-dried tomato pesto, roasted garlic paste and chicken stock mix

Return the pan to the heat, stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted

Once wilted, add the crème fraiche with a splash of cold water and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato pesto sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once crisp, transfer the crispy gnocchi to the creamy sun-dried tomato pesto sauce

Stir it all together – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato pesto & chicken thigh gnocchi

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato pesto & chicken thigh gnocchi in a bowl

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
