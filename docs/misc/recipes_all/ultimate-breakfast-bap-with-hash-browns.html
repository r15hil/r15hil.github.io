<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Add the Cumberland sausages to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 25-30 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(as finely as you can!)

Grate the potatoes (skins on)

Add the grated potato and sliced shallot to the middle of a tea towel with a pinch of salt and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much liquid as you can – this is your potato mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the chives finely

Add the potato mixture to a bowl with half the chives (save the rest for garnish!), a generous pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix up

Separate the mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and shape into rough potato cakes, about 1cm thick</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil, over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the potato cakes and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden and crispy

Once done, add them to a plate and set aside – these are your hash browns

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes in half

Once the hash browns are done, add the halved tomato to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min on each side until browned and softened

Once done, add them to the plate with the hash browns and set aside

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sausages are done, remove them from the oven and allow to cool

Slice the ciabatta rolls in half, then add them to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until they're hot and crusty

Grate the cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Crack the eggs into the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 2 min or until done to your liking

Once the sausages are cool enough to touch, slice them in half lengthways</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Butter the hot ciabatta rolls then top them with the tomato ketchup, sliced sausages, grated cheese and a fried egg

Sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives and serve the fried tomatoes and hash browns to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
