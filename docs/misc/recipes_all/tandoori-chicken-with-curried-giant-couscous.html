<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to a high heat, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Combine half your curry powder and half your natural yoghurt in a bowl with half your ginger & garlic paste (you'll use the rest later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your tandoori marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once softened, add your giant couscous and ground turmeric with your chicken stock mix, remaining curry powder, sultanas and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>boiled water and cook, covered, for 12-14 min or until all the water has absorbed and the giant couscous is tender

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once tender, stir through the spinach and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted– this is your curried giant couscous</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the marinated chicken to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is starting to char and is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your tandoori chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the remaining natural yoghurt and remaining ginger & garlic paste in a small bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your ginger & garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tandoori chicken over the curried giant couscous

Drizzle the ginger & garlic yoghurt all over and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
