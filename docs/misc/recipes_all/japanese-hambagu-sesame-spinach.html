<p><strong>Description:</strong> Hambagu, pronounced ham-ba-goo, is what the Japanese call their version of a hamburger. It's bunless and comes with plenty of rich, sticky sauce. We're serving ours over nutty brown rice with spinach gomaae (sesame spinach). Japan-easy! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).</p>

Return the pan to a medium-low heat and add the soy sauce, ketchup, Henderson's Relish and honey to the pan


Cook for 30 sec, whisking constantly&nbsp;&ndash; this is your umami sauce&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with the sliced spring onion
