<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, lengthways

Add the halved potatoes and your ground smoked paprika to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the potatoes are golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-5 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, drain and rinse your black beans and sweetcorn

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml] </span>boiled water

Once the onion has started to soften, increase the heat to medium-high and add your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the drained black beans & sweetcorn with the vegetable stock and cook for 10-15 min or until it's reduced to a stew-like consistency

Once done, crush some of the beans with a masher and give everything a good mix up until fully combined – this is your rancheros-style chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chilli is cooking, slice your green chilli[es] finely

Add the sliced chilli to a bowl with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and a pinch of sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled chilli

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the golden potatoes from the oven and crush with the base of a mug to flatten them

Tip: Just crush them gently, or they'll turn to mash!

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] back in the oven and cook for a further 5-8 min or until the potatoes are crisp and golden – these are your crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo and the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water – this is your garlic mayo

Crumble your Greek cheese into rough bite-sized pieces

Chop your chives finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rancheros-style chilli over the crispy potatoes

Drizzle over the garlic mayo, then sprinkle over the crumbled Greek cheese, chopped chives and quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your loaded patatas rancheros

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
