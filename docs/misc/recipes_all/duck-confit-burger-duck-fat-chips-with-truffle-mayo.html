<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Separate the white fat and the duck jelly from your duck leg[s] and set both aside for later

Add the duck leg[s] to one side of a tin foil-lined tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to the other side of the baking tray[s] with the reserved white fat and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 28 min or until the duck is golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[1 tsp] </span>sugar

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 6-7 min or until golden and softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onions are softening, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Reserve a handful of salad for your burgers, then combine the remaining salad and the tomato wedges in a bowl – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your onion marmalade to the pan with half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min or until all the liquid has evaporated – this is your caramelised onion

Transfer the caramelised onion to a plate then set aside until serving, reserve the pan

Combine your mayo and truffle olive oil in a bowl – this is your truffle mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the duck is golden and crispy, remove from the tray[s] and transfer to a clean chopping board

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add to the baking tray[s] where the duck was, cut-side up then return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min further or until the brioche is warmed through and the chips are golden and crisp

Toss the salad with a drizzle of olive oil and the remaining white wine vinegar – this is your tomato salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Shred apart the duck using two forks (watch out for any bones!) – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat and add the reserved duck jelly and the pulled duck

Mix together until fully combined and warmed through – this is your pulled confit duck</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread the warmed brioche base with a spoonful of truffle mayo, top with the reserved salad, the pulled confit duck, then spoon over the caramelised onion

Top with the warmed brioche lid and serve the duck fat chips and the tomato salad to the side with any remaining truffle mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
