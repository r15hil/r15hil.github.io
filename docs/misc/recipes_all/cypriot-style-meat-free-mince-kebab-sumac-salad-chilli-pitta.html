<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel your red onion[s] and slice half very finely

Finely dice (or grate) the remaining red onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!), diced onion, chopped garlic, chopped parsley, dried oregano and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Divide the meat-free mince mixture and roll into 3 small sausage shapes per person – these are your Cypriot-style meat-free mince kebabs

Lightly oil a baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil and add the Cypriot-style meat-free mince kebabs

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the kebabs are cooked through and browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the kebabs are cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice roughly on a diagonal

Dice your tomato[es]

Roughly tear the remaining parsley</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your wholemeal pitta to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and season with a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through – this is your chilli pitta</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the sliced cucumber, diced tomato, sliced onion and torn parsley to a large bowl

Add your natural yoghurt with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the juice of half the lemon[s], half your ground sumac (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges and cut the chilli pitta in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cypriot-style meat-free mince kebabs with the sumac salad and warmed chilli pitta to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining ground sumac and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
