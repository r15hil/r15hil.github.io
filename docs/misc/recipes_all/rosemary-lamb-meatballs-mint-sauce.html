<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your rosemary leaves from the stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs (approx. 1cm thick), and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with salt and pepper and half of the chopped rosemary (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, combine your lamb mince, chopped garlic, panko breadcrumbs and remaining chopped rosemary in a bowl

Sprinkle in your beef stock mix and season with plenty of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Mix the lamb mixture thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 3 meatballs per person (clean hands is the best way!) – these are your rosemary lamb meatballs

Refrigerate the meatballs until later

Tip: Chilling the meatballs helps them keep their shape when cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons and chopped spring greens to a small pot with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water, half your honey (you'll use the rest later!), a pinch of salt and a large knob of butter

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered for 10 min or until the carrot batons are tender – this is your honey veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the rosemary lamb meatballs and cook for 4 min, moving them about in the pan so they brown evenly

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered for 6-8 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the meatballs are cooking, strip the mint leaves from the stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks

Add them to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and bash the leaves to a rough paste

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar, the remaining honey, white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix to combine well – this is your mint sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rosemary lamb meatballs with the mint sauce, potato discs and honey veg to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
