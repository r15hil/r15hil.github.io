<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan with a large drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar, then turn down to a low heat for 20 min or until the onion is soft and caramelised

Place the ciabattas in the oven to warm through for 5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the ground cumin, chopped onion, lamb mince and half of the chopped mint and half of the garlic in a bowl (you'll use the rest in the next step)

Season generously with salt and pepper

Mix together (clean hands works best) and form 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> patties, then refrigerate them until later</p><br><br>

Toast the rolls for 4 min or until slightly charred

Set the toasted ciabatta aside (keep the pan for the next step!)</p><br><br>

Tip: press the patties down with a spatula to cook them evenly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble your burgers with the caramelised onions and minty yoghurt

Serve the sweet potato fries to the side
