<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 5 min – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!

After the 5 min, stir through your mirin and transfer the sticky rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber[s] finely

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your salmon fillet[s] to a plate with your gluten free soy sauce and give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your soy-marinated salmon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with your mayo and a squeeze of lime in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the soy-marinated salmon, skin-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until the skin is crispy

Once crispy, transfer it to a baking tray, skin-side up and reserve the pan, then put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the salmon is cooking, shape the cooled sticky rice into 1 patty per person

Wipe the reserved pan clean with kitchen paper and return it to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the rice patty[ies] and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crispy – this is your crispy rice patty

Tip: You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Layer the crispy rice patties with the sliced cucumber, sliced avocado and soy salmon on top

Garnish with a lime wedge, your black sesame seeds and drizzle over the sriracha mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
