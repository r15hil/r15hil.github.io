Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and chopped creamed coconut in 250ml<span class="text-purple"> [325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped sweet potato with the coconut stock and a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15-18 min or until the sweet potato is fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice, cardamom pods, 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato is tender, break up your crab meat gently with a fork, then stir it through the sauce – this is your Sri Lankan-style crab & sweet potato curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sri Lankan-style crab & sweet potato curry with the cardamom rice to the side (discard any cardamom pods!)

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the green chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
