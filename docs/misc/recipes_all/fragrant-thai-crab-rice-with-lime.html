<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the white long grain rice and Thai-style stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Meanwhile, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, make a well in the centre of the pan and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into it

Break the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> up with a spatula then allow to set slightly before mixing it through the rice

Remove the pan from the heat and fluff the cooked rice with a fork

Stir through the chopped coriander and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) – this is your fragrant Thai-style rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant Thai-style rice in bowls

Top with the white crab meat, crispy onions and sliced spring onion

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
