<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with the chopped garlic, half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix the pork mixture thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 3 patties per person (they don’t have to look perfect)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze the juice of half your lime[s] into a small bowl

Add your fish sauce, the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar and a splash of water

Stir it all together until the sugar has dissolved – this is your nuoc cham</p><br><br>

<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add your mooli slaw mix to a bowl with half the chopped coriander, half the nuoc cham (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled nuoc cham mooli slaw</p><br><br>
