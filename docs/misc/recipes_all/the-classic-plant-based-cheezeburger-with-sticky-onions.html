<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel your red onion[s] and slice into 2 rounds per person

Mix your Henderson's Relish and onion marmalade in a bowl – this is your onion marinade mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chips have been cooking for 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven, add the red onion rounds to the other side and spoon over the onion marinade mix

Drizzle them with a little olive oil and return the tray[s] to the oven for 20-25 min further or until softened and sticky – these are your sticky onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut 2 thin slices per person from your tomato[es] and set them aside for serving

Chop the remaining tomato roughly

Wash your gem lettuce, pat it dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside until serving

Tear the remaining gem lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the patty[ies] are cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and top each meat-free burger patty with a cheese flavour slice

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them to the other side of the tray

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? You may need to use a separate tray!

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top the warmed brioche bun base with a squeeze of ketchup, a reserved lettuce leaf, the tomato slices, a cheezy patty, the sticky onions and a warmed brioche bun lid

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
