<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high, then add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Add half of the chopped ginger to a large bowl with the miso paste, 1/3 of the toasted sesame oil (you'll use the rest later!) and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>cold water

Mix until smooth – this is your miso marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the haddock bites to the miso marinade and give them a gentle mix up until fully coated

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a tray with tin foil and add the coated haddock bites

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until the fish is cooked though and starting to char

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the haddock is cooking, cut the cucumber in half lengthways (scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard), then dice

Add the blanched edamame beans to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them, then run under cold water until cool

Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> as finely as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining chopped ginger with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, remaining sesame oil and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a small bowl – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the diced cucumber, blanched edamame beans and sliced shallot to the bowl with the dressing and give it a good mix up – this is your edamame salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the edamame salad over the cooked rice and drizzle any remaining dressing from the bowl all over

Top with the grilled miso haddock and sprinkle over the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
