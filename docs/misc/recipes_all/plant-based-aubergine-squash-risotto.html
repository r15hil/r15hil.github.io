<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Slice the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> on

Score the aubergine flesh in a criss-cross pattern, then add the aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml <span class="text-danger">[1.4L] </span>boiled water

Once softened, add the arborio rice to the pan with the chopped garlic and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine has had an initial 15 min, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and press the aubergine flesh down firmly with a fork to release the juices (this will help them cook quicker!)

Add the butternut squash cubes to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for 15 min further or until the aubergine flesh has softened and the butternut squash is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skins with a fork and discard the skins

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily

Add the softened aubergine flesh and half the toasted pine nuts (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor with the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon, a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Blitz until smooth – this is your aubergine purée</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, stir through the aubergine purée with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 2-3 min

Tear in the basil leaves and gently mix everything together – this is your aubergine risotto

Slice the remaining lemon into wedges

Wash the salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the aubergine risotto topped with the roasted butternut squash

Garnish with the remaining toasted pine nuts and the salad, then season with a few grinds of black pepper

Drizzle the balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil over the salad and serve the lemon wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
