<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper then tear into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the tofu pieces to a large bowl with half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up

Once fully coated, add most of your cornflour to the bowl (you’ll use the rest later!) and mix it all together until fully coated

Once very hot, add the coated tofu to the pan, and cook for 8-9 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp (reserve the bowl) – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the tofu is cooking, wipe out the reserved bowl and add your medium egg noodles

Cover the noodles with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 5-6 min

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water, and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Combine your Chinese rice wine with your toasted sesame oil, sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining soy sauce, white wine vinegar, hoisin sauce and remaining cornflour

Give everything a good mix up, then add 75ml<span class="text-purple"> [110ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your Chinese-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix and half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add the drained noodles to the pan with the Chinese-style sauce

Stir it all together and cook for a further 30 secs or until the noodles are coated in the sauce – these are your Chinese-style hoisin noodles

Tip: Add a splash of starchy noodle water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Chinese-style hoisin noodles topped with the crispy tofu

Garnish with the remaining chopped spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
