<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped, then transfer your crispy chicken to a plate, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil, dried thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your thyme roasties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your lemon[s] in half, then peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the lemon halves (cut-side down) and sliced shallot and cook for 3-4 min or until the lemon has caramelised

Once caramelised, transfer the caramelised lemon halves to a plate and set aside for later</p><br><br>

Scrunch the foil around the Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>
