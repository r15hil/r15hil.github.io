<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Chop your chicken breast strips into smaller strips, then add to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, tear your ciabatta[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-7 min or until crisp and golden – these are your ciabatta croutons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a bowl with your Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar and mayo

Add your capers, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> cold water

Season with a pinch of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Caesar dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Grate any of the remaining Italian hard cheese</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add your outer lettuce leaves and shredded lettuce to your bowls and top with the cooked chicken and Italian hard cheese shavings

Drizzle over the Caesar dressing, add the ciabatta croutons and sprinkle over any grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
