<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Soak your skewers in a bowl of cold water (this prevents them from burning when cooking)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely grate your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the basmati rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down (reserve the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your ground smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a large bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style seasoning

Transfer half of the Cajun-style seasoning to a separate bowl and set aside (you'll use the rest later!)

Drain your king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped pepper and king prawns in the large bowl of Cajun-style seasoning and then thread them onto the skewers – these are your Cajun-style king prawn skewers

Add the Cajun-style king prawn skewers to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the peppers are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the skewers are cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the chopped tomato and white wine vinegar to a small bowl with the chopped coriander and a pinch of salt and mix to combine – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste, mayo and a pinch of salt to the bowl of reserved Cajun-style seasoning with a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and mix to combine – this is your Cajun-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt

Once the butter is starting to melt, add the grated garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the cooled basmati rice and cook for 2 min or until warmed through – this is your garlic butter rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlic butter rice with the Cajun-style king prawn skewers and tomato salsa to the side

Drizzle over the Cajun-style sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
