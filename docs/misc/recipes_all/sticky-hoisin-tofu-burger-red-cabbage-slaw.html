<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat dry with kitchen paper

Slice lengthways into 3 flat pieces per person

Add the tofu slices to a plate with your cornflour and season with a pinch of salt

Turn them a few times until all of the tofu slices are fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu slices with your soy sauce and cook for 3-4 min on each side until crispy and golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the chips are nearly done, take the tray[s] out the oven and add the brioche halves

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 2-3 min or until the brioche bun halves are warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tofu is crispy and golden, reduce the heat to low and add half the plum sauce (save the rest for later!) and your toasted sesame seeds to the pan

Cook for 1-2 min further until the tofu slices are fully coated in the sauce – this is your sticky hoisin tofu</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread each warmed brioche base with a dollop of reserved plum sauce

Top with the sticky hoisin tofu, a spoonful of red cabbage slaw and the warmed brioche lid – this is your sticky hoisin tofu burger

Serve the chips and any remaining red cabbage slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
