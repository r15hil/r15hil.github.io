<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Chop the waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot and keep covered until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Grate the apple<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(skin on) and discard the core<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the grated carrot with the grated apple, grated cucumber, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime and the mayo in a bowl – this is your tangy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice the spring onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water in a small bowl and mix well – this is your gochujang mixture

Once the spring onions are soft, add the drained potatoes and gochujang mixture to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the potatoes have started to brown, add the spinach to the pan with a splash of water and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until wilted

Grate the Italian hard cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the greens have wilted, crack the eggs over the potatoes, sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the eggs are cooked through and the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy gochujang potatoes with fried egg

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy gochujang potatoes with fried egg with the tangy slaw to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander, toasted sesame seeds and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
