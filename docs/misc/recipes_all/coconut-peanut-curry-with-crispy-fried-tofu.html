<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Peel and chop your shallot[s] into wedges

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then cut the tofu into strips

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the tofu strips and garam masala to the pan and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until golden and crisp

Meanwhile, heat a separate, large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>
