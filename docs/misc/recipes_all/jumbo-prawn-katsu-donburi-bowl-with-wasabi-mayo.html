<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the brown onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced brown onions with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>sugar and cook for 7-8 min or until caramelised

Once the onions are caramelised, add to a bowl with the soy sauce and mirin and set aside (save the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onions are caramelising, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Trim the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> then slice widthways into quarters

Chop each quarter into 4 lengthways – these are your shredded spring onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get perfectly fluffy rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat the jumbo prawns dry with kitchen paper

Coat the jumbo prawns in the flour, tap off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg and press them into the panko breadcrumbs to firmly to coat everything evenly – these are your katsu jumbo prawns

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to fully coat the bottom of the pan)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add the katsu jumbo prawns and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through

Meanwhile, combine the wasabi paste with the mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your wasabi mayo

Add the blanched edamame beans to another bowl with a pinch of salt and microwave for 1 minute or until hot and cooked with a bite</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky rice into bowls topped evenly with the caramelised onions

Top with the edamame beans, grated carrot, shredded spring onions and katsu jumbo prawns

Drizzle the wasabi mayo over the prawns

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
