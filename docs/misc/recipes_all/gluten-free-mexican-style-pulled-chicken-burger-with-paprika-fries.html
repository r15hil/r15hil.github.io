<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and your ground smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy – these are your paprika fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Whilst the fries are cooking, add your ground cumin, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a plate

Gently stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to the plate and turn several times until fully coated in the spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Grate your cheddar cheese

Combine your mayo and white wine vinegar in a bowl and set aside for later – this is your zingy mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper, remove 2 outer leaves per person and shred the inner core

Dice your tomato[es]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half and add to a baking tray, cut-side up

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, season with a pinch of salt and mix it all up until fully coated in the sauce

Return the pan to a medium heat, top the pulled chicken with the grated cheese and cook, covered, for 1 min further or until melted – this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, fill a warmed brioche bun with the lettuce leaves, Mexican-style pulled chicken and zingy mayo – this is your gluten free Mexican-style pulled chicken burger

Serve the paprika fries, shredded lettuce and diced tomato to the side

Drizzle any remaining zingy mayo over the lettuce and tomato

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
