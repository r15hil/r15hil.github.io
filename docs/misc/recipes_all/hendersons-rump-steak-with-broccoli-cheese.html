<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Peel your potatoes and chop them into quarters, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drain and shake the potatoes around the colander to fluff up the edges, then chop your broccoli into small florets

Grate your cheddar cheese, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail and slice your carrot[s] at an angle, then reboil a kettle

Add your rump steak[s] to a bowl with half your Henderson's Relish (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Melt 15g<span class="text-purple"> [20g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[30g]</span> butter in a pan over a medium heat and once melted, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, add 15g <span class="text-purple">[20g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [30g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-6 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 2/3 of the grated cheese to the béchamel and cook for 1-2 min further until melted, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cheesy sauce

Add the broccoli florets to an oven-proof dish and pour the cheesy sauce all over so the broccoli is nicely coated (wipe the pan clean and reserve for later!)

Sprinkle over the remaining grated cheese and your panko breadcrumbs with a drizzle of olive oil – this is your broccoli cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min

Put the broccoli cheese in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden

After the initial 20 min, add the sliced carrot to the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with the potatoes and return it to the oven for a final 15 min or until tender with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your onion marmalade and remaining Henderson's Relish – this is your beef & onion stock

Once the carrots have been cooking for 10 min, return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and once very hot, add the steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the steak is done, transfer to a clean board to rest, reserving the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Whisk in the beef & onion stock, then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened – this is your beef & onion gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested rump steak finely on a clean board and pour any resting juices into the beef & onion gravy

Serve the sliced rump steak with the roasted potatoes, carrots and broccoli cheese to the side

Pour the beef & onion gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
