<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

Add your Henderson's Relish and vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine kernel & seed mix and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Remove the mushroom pan from the heat and stir in your cultured coconut, then add the drained tortiglioni and give everything a good mix up – this is your mushroom & thyme tortiglioni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom & thyme tortiglioni and season with a good grind of black pepper

Garnish with the toasted pine kernel & seed mix

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
