<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear in half

Combine your lean beef mince with half the chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix, then divide the lean beef mixture into 1 ball per person and flatten the mixture and add the mozzarella halves to the middle of each lean beef mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Seal up the meat around the mozzarella and shape into a meatball

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the mozzarella-stuffed meatballs and cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over, then transfer to an oven-proof dish

Reserve the pan and boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice your onion[s], roughly chop your cherry tomatoes and top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a little drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped tomatoes, grated carrot and dried oregano with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp] </span>flour and a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve your beef stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[400ml] </span>[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the vegetables have softened, add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min further or until the sauce has slightly thickened

Once slightly thickened, pour the sauce over the meatballs and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the meatballs are browned and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil a full kettle

Whilst the sauce is cooking, peel your potatoes and chop them into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach with cold water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can, then chop it roughly

Add the chopped spinach to the mash – this is your spinach mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mozzarella-stuffed meatball over the spinach mash with the tomato sauce poured all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
