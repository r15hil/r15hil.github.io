<p><strong>Description:</strong> This pasta is mushroomy to the max. You'll make a duxelle which is an intense, pan-fried mushroom, shallot and garlic mixture, usually found in a classic beef Wellington. We've used it here to infuse some umami flavour, enhanced by grilled portobello mushrooms. Our secret ingredient, Greek-style yoghurt, provides creaminess without the extra kcals.</p>
