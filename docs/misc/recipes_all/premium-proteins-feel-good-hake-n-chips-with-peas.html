<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chives finely

Combine the chopped chives with your panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt in a bowl

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and stir it together until all of the breadcrumbs are coated in the oil – this is your chive crumb</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your hake fillet[s] to a separate baking tray and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Top the fish evenly with the chive crumb and press it into the fish using the back of a spoon

Put the tray in the oven for 12-14 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your breaded hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, combine a squeeze of lemon juice with the mayo in a bowl

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lemony mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons

Add the carrot batons to a pot with a lid, with plenty of boiling water over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas and cook for 2 min further or until everything's tender

Once done, drain the vegetables and return them to the pot with a knob of butter

Keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the breaded hake with the chips, vegetables and lemony mayo to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge and enjoy!
