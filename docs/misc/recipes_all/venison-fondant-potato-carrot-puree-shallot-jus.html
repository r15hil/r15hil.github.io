<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Slice approx. 1cm from each end of the Maris Piper potatoes so you're left with flat ends   Peel the potato skin until they resemble a boat-shape

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the potatoes & cook for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown

Flip the potatoes and add a knob of butter, thyme and unpeeled garlic and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the other side is golden brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Dissolve 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> Knorr beef stock cube (save the rest for later) in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water

Transfer the browned potatoes to an oven-proof dish and pour over the garlic & thyme oil

Pour the beef stock over until the stock is halfway up the potatoes.

Tip: Add a splash more water if needed!

Put the dish in the oven for 30-40 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through – these are your fondant potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, re-boil a kettle

Top, tail, peel and finely slice the carrots

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and cut the shallots in half lengthways

Wipe the pan clean and return it to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the shallots, cut-side down, and cook for 5-6 minutes or until caramelised

Once caramelised, set the shallots aside until later

Add the drained carrots to a food processor with the clotted cream and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Season with a generous pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your carrot purée

Return the carrot purée to the pot and heat up just before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat the venison steaks dry with kitchen paper and season generously with salt and pepper

Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once very hot, add the venison steaks and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side for medium and 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-well done

Once done, transfer the venison to a plate and cover until serving, reserving the pan (and oil) for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the venison is cooking, re-boil a kettle

Dissolve the remaining beef stock cube and onion marmalade in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Once the venison is cooked, return the pan to a medium heat

Tip: Add a drizzle of oil if it's looking a little dry!

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 minute or until a sandy-paste (roux) remains

Gradually stir the stock into the roux and return the caramelised shallots to the pan

Cook for 5-6 minutes or until the sauce has thickened so that it coats the back of a wooden spoon – this is your shallot jus</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the cavolo nero roughly

Add the cavolo nero and a pinch of salt to a pot of boiling water and cook for 2-3 minutes or until wilted

Drain and set aside until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the venison steaks finely

Pour any resting juices into the shallot jus

Serve the sliced venison steaks over the carrot purée (smear it with the back of a spoon for fancy presentation!) with the potato fondant, caramelised shallots and cavolo nero to the side

Spoon over the shallot jus

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
