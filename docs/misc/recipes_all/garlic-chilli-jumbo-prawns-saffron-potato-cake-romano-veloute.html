<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Roast the peppers


Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6.


Cut the Romano pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon).


Add the pepper to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until softened.


Boil a kettle.</p><br><br>

Meanwhile, peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces.<br /><br />Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-15 minutes or until fork-tender.<br /><br />Once cooked, drain and leave them to steam dry.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Make the saffron potato cake mix

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Prepare the potato cakes


Divide the mash into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape them into potato cakes.


Once the Romano pepper is done, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later.


Add the potato cakes to the tray and drizzle them all over with vegetable oil.


Return the tray to the oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once halfway – these are your saffron potato cakes.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Once the saffron potato cakes have been in the oven for 15 minutes, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> vegetable stock cube and the soft cheese in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock.


Peel the skin from the roasted Romano pepper<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and discard.


Add the Romano pepper and creamy stock to a food processor (or blender!) and blitz until smooth – this is your Romano velouté.</p><br><br>
