<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Drain and rinse your green lentils and red lentils together under cold running water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) your ginger, then chop it in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the rinsed lentils, crushed garlic, ginger halves, cardamom pods, curry powder and ground turmeric to the dish and give everything a good mix up

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<p>Add in your chicken stock mix, cracked black pepper, chopped creamed coconut and 500ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[650ml] </span>[850ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good stir, then top with your diced chicken thigh</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for an initial 15 min

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and give everything a stir

Return the dish, uncovered, to the oven for 5 min further or until the lentils have split and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your black pepper & chicken dal

Add your naan[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the black pepper & chicken dal and garnish with your crispy onions

Tip: Discard the ginger halves and cardamom pods!

Tear over your coriander and mint leaves and serve the warmed naan to the side

Dig in!</p><br><br>
