<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finley chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your sausages to the opposite side of the tray

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until the sausages are golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is starting to brown

Meanwhile, boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span>[2 tbsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-high heat

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for approx. 2-3 min or until it turns into a runny glaze that coats the back of a spoon

Tip: Watch the pan like a hawk to make sure it doesn't burn!

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and set aside until serving – this is your balsamic glaze</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Fluff the couscous with a fork

Carefully remove the skin from the roasted onion by cutting the root end off and peeling off the skin, then separate the onion into petals

Chop the roasted pepper into small pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Mix the chopped roasted pepper, roasted onion petals and chopped basil through the couscous – this is your roasted veg couscous

Drizzle generously with olive oil and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked sausages over the roasted veg couscous

Spoon the balsamic glaze all over the sausages

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
