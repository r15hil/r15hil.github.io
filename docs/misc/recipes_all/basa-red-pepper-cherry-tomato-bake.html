<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and season with salt and pepper, then add them to the vegetables and push them down slightly

Return the dish to the oven for 12-15 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the basa is cooked through – this is your basa, red pepper & cherry tomato bake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Tear the basil leaves roughly

Serve the basa, red pepper & cherry tomato bake and garnish with the torn basil leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
