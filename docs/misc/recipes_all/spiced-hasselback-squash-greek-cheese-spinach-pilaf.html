<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel the butternut squash<span class="text-danger">[es] </span>and cut in half using a sharp knife

Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut narrow slices (about 1cm apart) into the butternut squash halves, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base – this is your hasselback butternut squash

Combine the ras el hanout and dried oregano with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your spiced marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer the hasselback butternut squash to a tray and drizzle over the spiced marinade, then cover with tin foil

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 40 min or until the butternut squash is soft

After 40 min, remove the tin foil and cook for a further 5-10 min or until golden – this is your spiced hasselback butternut squash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add the spinach to a colander and pour over the boiled water so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until cool

Squeeze the water out of the cooled spinach, then chop it roughly

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the bulgur wheat and cook for 1 min or until it's lightly toasted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable stock, chopped spinach and sultanas to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the bulgur is tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes roughly

Strip the mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Combine the chopped tomatoes and mint leaves with a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt – this is your tomato & mint salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, crumble the Greek cheese into the cooked bulgur and give everything a gentle mix – this is your Greek cheese & spinach pilaf

Serve the spiced hasselback butternut squash over the Greek cheese & spinach pilaf with the tomato & mint salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
