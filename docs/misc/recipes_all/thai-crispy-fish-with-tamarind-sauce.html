<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basa fillet[s] to a plate and drizzle your soy sauce all over them, turn the fish several times until all the soy sauce has been absorbed

Sprinkle your cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated, then set aside for later – this is your coated basa

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice and 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for an initial 12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden, crisp and cooked through – this is your Thai-style crispy basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, combine your tamarind paste, fish sauce, 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> [4 tsp]</span> sugar and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [260ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tamarind stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice has had an initial 12 min, trim, then add your green beans to the pot

Cook, covered, for a further 5-8 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice and green beans are cooked

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered until serving

Heat a separate pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the sliced shallot, chopped garlic and chopped chilli and cook for 1 min

Add the tamarind stock, bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened slightly – this is your tamarind sauce

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style crispy basa with the cooked rice & green beans to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Drizzle the fish with the tamarind sauce and top it with the chopped coriander, sliced spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
