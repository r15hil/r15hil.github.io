<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary.

Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle, then cut the sweet pointed peppers in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the halved peppers skin side down to the pan and cook for 1 min or until starting to char</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once starting to char, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook covered for a further 7-8 min or until soft – these are your pan-fried peppers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water

Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl with the vegetable stock and sultanas, cover with cling film and set aside until all the water has absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the couscous has absorbed all the water, fluff it with a fork

Add the chopped coriander, chopped parsley and chopped mint with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin and ground paprika

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your chermoula couscous</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pan-fried peppers stuffed with the chermoula couscous

Drizzle over the cultured coconut

Garnish with the flaked almonds, a lemon wedge and a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
