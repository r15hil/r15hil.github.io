<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 18-20 min, add the onion petals to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a further 5 min or until the onion is starting to soften

Add the halved walnuts for a final 3-4 min or until everything is cooked through and the walnuts are toasted

Tip: Watch the walnuts like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Meanwhile, wash the shredded kale then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop the apple<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into matchsticks

Once everything is cooked, add the shredded kale, apple matchsticks, cooked potatoes, roasted onion petals and toasted walnuts to a large bowl

Add half of the honey mustard dressing (you'll use the rest later!) and gently mix together – this is your kale salad with honey mustard dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat-free sausages over the kale salad

Drizzle the remaining honey mustard dressing all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
