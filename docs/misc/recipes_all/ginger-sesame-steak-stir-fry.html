<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic, then peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Trim, then chop your spring onion[s] into thirds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

Add your rump steak[s] to the plate and coat both sides in the cornflour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the coated steak to the pan and cook for 2 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once browned, turn the steak and add the sliced garlic, chopped ginger, chopped spring onion, toasted sesame oil and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add your mirin and soy sauce to the pan and cook for 2 min further or until the sauce has started to reduce

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once done, remove the steak from the pan and transfer to a clean board

Remove the pan from the heat and add the blanched edamame beans with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> cold water, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and return to the heat

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until the sauce has thickened

Meanwhile, trim any fat from the steak and slice thinly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the sliced steak to the pan with your toasted sesame seeds, then stir it all together so that the steak is coated in sauce – this is your ginger & sesame steak stir-fry

Tip: If the steak is still too pink for your liking, cook for 1-2 min further!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the ginger & sesame steak stir-fry over the cooked rice

Roughly tear your coriander over the stir-fry and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
