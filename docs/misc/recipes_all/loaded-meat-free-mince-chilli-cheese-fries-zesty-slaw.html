<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and ground cumin and cook for 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> boiled water

Add your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar, then mix to combine – this is your spicy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the spicy stock to the meat-free mince

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meat-free mince is cooked through

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for later – this is your meat-free mince chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chilli is cooking, combine your mayo with the zest and juice of half your lime[s], 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your zesty slaw dressing

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are done, push them into 1 pile per person on the baking tray[s]

Top each pile with the meat-free mince chilli and then the grated cheese, and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5 min or until the cheese has melted

Once done, set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly – these are your loaded meat-free mince chilli cheese fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Combine the grated carrot, shredded lettuce and zesty slaw dressing then give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty slaw

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the loaded meat-free mince chilli cheese fries with the zesty slaw to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
