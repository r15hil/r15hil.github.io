<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Chop your waxy potatoes in half and add to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender

Once fork-tender, add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper and gently mix together – these are your buttery potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into bite-sized pieces – this is your smashed cucumber

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!</p><br><br>

<p>Cut your halloumi into thick slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add half the smashed cucumber (save the rest for later!) to a bowl with your yoghurt, mint sauce and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chunky tzatziki</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the halloumi with the buttery potatoes, chopped lettuce and chunky tzatziki to the side

Top the lettuce with the remaining smashed cucumber, then dress with a drizzle of olive oil, your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Drizzle your red chilli relish over the halloumi

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
