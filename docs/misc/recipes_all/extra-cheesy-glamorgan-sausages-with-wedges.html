<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves and slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Add the leek with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 12 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the leek is softening, grate the cheddar cheese

Combine the grated cheese with the panko breadcrumbs and a generous grind of black pepper – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Separate the egg yolk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the white<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> by cracking the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> over a small bowl and catching the yolk in the shell

Transfer the yolk from one shell half to the other several times, until all the whites are in the bowl and you are left with the yolk in the shell

Set the egg white aside for later

In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolk with the Dijon mustard</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the leeks are softened, add them to the cheesy breadcrumbs with the egg yolk mixture and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Mix thoroughly until you are left with a mouldable texture

Divide the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> and carefully roll into fat sausage shapes – these are your Glamorgan sausages

Tip: They don't have to be perfect, but make sure they're packed tightly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate

Beat the egg whites with a fork

Add the grated Italian hard cheese to another plate

Coat the Glamorgan sausages in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the beaten egg whites and finally press into the cheese to evenly coat

Add to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put in the oven for 20 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Halve the cherry tomatoes and add them to a large piece of tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Tip: Double up the foil to prevent any leakages!

Scrunch the edges of the parcel together until fully sealed, then add the parcel to the oven for 15-18 min or until softened – these are your roasted tomatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the crispy Glamorgan sausages with the wedges, roasted tomatoes and the baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
