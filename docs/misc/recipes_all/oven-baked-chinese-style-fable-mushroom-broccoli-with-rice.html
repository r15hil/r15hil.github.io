<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chopped onion, sliced garlic and cornflour and give everything a good mix up

Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[520ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[680ml]</span> boiled water with half your gluten free soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), ginger paste, hoisin sauce and vegetable stock mix

Bring to the boil over a high heat and put the dish in the oven, uncovered, and cook for 20-25 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Chinese-style Fable mushroom</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bash your cucumber with a rolling pin and chop it into large, bite-sized pieces

Tip: Bash the cucumber in the bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Combine the bashed cucumber and remaining gluten free soy sauce in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of sugar – this is your bashed cucumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the Chinese-style Fable mushroom is ready, remove the dish from the oven and add the chopped Tenderstem broccoli

Give everything a good mix up and return the dish to the oven for 10 min or until the broccoli is tender – this is your oven baked Chinese-style Fable mushroom & broccoli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the oven baked Chinese-style Fable mushroom & broccoli with the baked rice and smashed cucumber salad to the side
