Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> [1 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Whilst the seeds are toasting, add the cooked bulgur wheat to the pan with the softened kale, lentils and onion and stir it all together – these are your grains</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted butternut squash and Tenderstem broccoli over the grains

Drizzle over the miso dressing

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
