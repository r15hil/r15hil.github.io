<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges and cut the cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems, then chop your dill finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Chop your pitta[s] into rough bite-sized triangles

Add the pitta triangles to a baking tray with 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp] </span>[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of salt and your ground sumac

Give it a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the meat-free chick'n is browning, dissolve your tomato paste and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[110ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the meat-free chick'n has browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the harissa stock

Cook for a further 3-4 min, until the meat-free chick'n is warmed through and the stock has reduced</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst everything is cooking, combine your vegan mayo with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give it a good mix up until it's smooth – this is your lemony dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free chick'n is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the meat-free chick'n to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until fully coated in the sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your baby leaf salad, then add to a large bowl with the grated carrot, chopped cucumber, tomato wedges, crunchy pitta and most of the chopped herbs (save some for garnish!)

Add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice from the remaining lemon and a pinch of salt

Give it a gentle mix up – this is your crunchy pitta salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the shredded harissa meat-free chick'n over the crunchy pitta salad

Drizzle with the lemony dressing and garnish with the remaining herbs

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
