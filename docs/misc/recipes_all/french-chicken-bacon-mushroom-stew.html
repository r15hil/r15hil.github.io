<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish is inspired by the classic Coq au Vin, combining chicken and smoked bacon, braised in a full-bodied sauce with caramelised shallot, leek and baby chestnut mushrooms. You'll swap the more traditional red wine with Shaoxing wine, to give the dish a lighter feel without losing flavour. Served over parsley mash. C'est d√©licieux!</p>
