<h4>Step 1</h4>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your meat-free bacon lardons to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy

Once crispy, transfer the cooked meat-free bacon lardons to a clean plate and set aside, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

Season with a good grind of black pepper
