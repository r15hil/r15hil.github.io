<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomatoes and chicken stock mix to the pan, then reduce the heat to medium and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 10-15 min or until the tomatoes have reduced to the consistency of a thick sauce and the chicken is cooked (no pink meat!) – this is your tomato & chicken sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your linguine to a large pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt over a high heat

Bring to the boil and cook for 8-10 min, or until cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the spinach to the linguine and cook for 30 secs or until the spinach has wilted, then drain, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water, and return to the pot

Once the tomato sauce has thickened, add the drained linguine & spinach to the pan with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar, a very generous pinch of salt and a splash of starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up until the linguine is coated in the sauce – this is your tangy tomato & chicken linguine</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tangy tomato & chicken linguine and sprinkle over your black sesame seeds and toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
