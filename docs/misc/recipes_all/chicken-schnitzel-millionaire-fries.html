<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with half the truffle oil, a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chicken breasts to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken breasts with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your chicken escalopes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate

Coat the chicken escalopes in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them into the beaten egg and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken schnitzel

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Add the pickled red cabbage and grated carrot to a large bowl with the mayo and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy red cabbage slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are golden, remove them from the oven and add the chopped garlic, remaining truffle oil and half of the grated Italian hard cheese and chopped parsley (save the rest for later!)

Gently toss everything together and return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your millionaire fries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken schnitzel with the millionaire fries and creamy red cabbage slaw to the side

Top the millionaire fries with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
