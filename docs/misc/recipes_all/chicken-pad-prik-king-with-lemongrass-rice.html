<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger, shallot[s] and garlic, then roughly chop your coriander, including the stalks

Bash your lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later, then chop the softer inner core[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot[s], garlic, ginger, chopped lemongrass and coriander to a food processor with your ground paprika, cracked black pepper, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil, 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> cold water and 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp] </span>sugar and blitz to a paste – this is your fiery curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice to a pot with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> water and the outer lemongrass layers<span class="text-danger"> </span>and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and discard the outer lemongrass layers – this is your lemongrass rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 4-5 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is browned, add the halved green beans and onion petals and cook for a further 3-4 min or until the veg has started to soften and the chicken is golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken pad prik king over the lemongrass rice

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
