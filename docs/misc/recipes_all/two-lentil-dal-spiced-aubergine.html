<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned aubergine and cook for 1 min on each side or until browned

Transfer the browned aubergine to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through (reserve the pan for later!) – this is your spiced aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold water

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the two-lentil dal in a bowl topped with the spiced aubergine

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a dollop of the remaining cultured coconut
