<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the aubergines in half lengthways (including the stalks), then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Add the chopped ginger to a large bowl with the curry powder, half the natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper and transfer the scored aubergine, cut side up, and spread most of the curry marinade all over them (save a little for later!)

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Crush the garlic with the side of a knife, keeping the skins on

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine has had an initial 10 min, add the chopped potatoes, red onion wedges and crushed garlic to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Sprinkle over the ground turmeric and yellow mustard seeds

Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges

Squeeze half the lemon wedges over the potatoes and add the squeezed wedges to the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (save the remaining wedges for garnish)

Add in the reserved curry marinade and give everything a good mix up

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a further 30 min or until everything is cooked through and tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything's cooked through and tender, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven and top everything with the spinach then return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a further 5 min or until the spinach has wilted

Meanwhile, slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Once the spinach has wilted, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>from the oven and stir the it through the potatoes and onion wedges – this is your Indian-style spiced aubergine tray bake with spinach</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indian-style spiced aubergine with the potato, spinach and onion wedges to the side

Dollop with the remaining natural yoghurt

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), nigella seeds and lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
