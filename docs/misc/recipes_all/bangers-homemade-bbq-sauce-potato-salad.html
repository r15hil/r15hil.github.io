<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil half a kettle

Add the Cumberland sausages to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil (to prevent the sausages from sticking)

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 min or until the sausages are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop the waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-12 min or until fork tender, then drain</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are boiling, combine the mayo, cider vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and a good grind of pepper in a large bowl – this is your creamy dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once drained, add the cooked potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, the smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper

Lightly squash each potato with a fork

Give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy smashed potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Return the tray to the oven for a further 5-6 min – these are your BBQ bangers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>

Spoon any remaining BBQ sauce all over
