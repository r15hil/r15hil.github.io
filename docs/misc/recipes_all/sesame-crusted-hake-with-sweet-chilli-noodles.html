<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Pat your hake fillets dry with kitchen paper and add them to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Spread your miso paste evenly over the hake fillets with the back of a teaspoon</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Sprinkle all your sesame seeds over your hake fillets and press down firmly with your hand so that they stick

Drizzle the fish with vegetable oil and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through – this is your sesame-crusted hake

Tip: your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your wholewheat noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5 min</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add the chopped ginger to a bowl with your soy sauce, chilli relish, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and the juice of half your lime[s]

Give everything a good old mix up – this is your sweet chilli dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the noodles have been cooking for 5 min, add your Tenderstem broccoli and cook for 2 min further, or until everything's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain everything and return it to the pot</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onions</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the sweet chilli dressing to the noodles with the sliced spring onion and mix everything together – these are your sweet chilli noodles

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sesame-crusted hake over the sweet chilli noodles

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
