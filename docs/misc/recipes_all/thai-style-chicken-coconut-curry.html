<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken and onion wedges and cook for 4-5 min or until the chicken is starting to brown and the onion is starting to soften

Meanwhile cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely, set some aside for garnish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water — this is your chicken stock

Once the chicken has browned, add chopped ginger, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your red Thai curry paste to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

Cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the sauce has reduced and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely, then chop the leaves finely and set aside for garnish

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the chopped coriander stalks to the pan

Add your cultured coconut and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan — this is your Thai-style chicken & coconut curry

Cut the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style chicken & coconut curry with the basmati rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped peanuts, chopped coriander leaves, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
