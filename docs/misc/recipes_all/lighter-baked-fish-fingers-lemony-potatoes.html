<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot

Keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut in half

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate

Add the lemon zest, your dried oregano, 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the breadcrumbs and mix everything together – these are your herby breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your basa fillet[s] into strips

Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a small bowl

Coat the basa strips in the flour, tap off any excess, then add into the milk and then firmly press into the herby breadcrumbs to coat evenly – these are your coated fish fingers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the coated fish fingers to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 14-15 min or until cooked through and golden – these are your baked fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil a full kettle

While the fish fingers are cooking, add the juice of half the lemon[s] (not sure about citrus? Try using less!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper to the drained potatoes – these are your lemony potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and a squeeze of lemon juice in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your lemony mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When your fish fingers are almost ready, add your blanched peas and spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and mix it all together– these are your buttery greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked fish fingers with the lemony potatoes, buttery greens and lemony mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
