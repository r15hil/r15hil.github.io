<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice, ground turmeric, sultanas, a generous pinch of salt and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with the juice of half your lime[s] and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped chicken, curry powder and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, tear your garlic & coriander naan[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy – these are your naan croutons

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the chicken pan from the heat, then add your mango chutney and nigella seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your mango glazed chicken

Add the cooked basmati rice to a sieve and run it under cold running water until cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salad in a bowl, top with the mango glazed free range chicken and drizzle the lime dressing all over – this is your fruity indian-style free range chicken salad

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
