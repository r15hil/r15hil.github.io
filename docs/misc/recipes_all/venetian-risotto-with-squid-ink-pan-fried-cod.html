<p><strong>Description:</strong> Risòto col néro is a signature dish of Venetian cuisine. The dramatic colouring reflects the culture of the city and its relationship with the sea. The squid ink gives it a deliciously subtle flavour, perfectly paired with delicate flaky cod and zingy lemon. (Gluten-free, suitable for coeliacs.)</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the rice has toasted, add the vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, then add the squid ink stirring continuously for 20-25 min or until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked with a slight bite (this is known as al denté!)


Tip: Add a splash more water and keep cooking if the rice needs more time!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice has been cooking for 15-20 mins, heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the cod fillets to the pan and cook for 4 min, carefully flipping once halfway through, then season with a pinch of salt


Tip: Your fish is cooked once it flakes easily!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, stir through a generous knob of butter and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon – this is your risotto with squid ink


Wash and drain the wild rocket</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges


Serve the pan-fried cod over the risotto with squid ink and garnish with the washed rocket and a lemon wedge


Drizzle the rocket with a little olive oil


Buon appetito!</p><br><br>
