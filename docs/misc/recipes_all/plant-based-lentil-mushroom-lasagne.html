<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste and dried oregano in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Heat a pot over a medium heat

Add the creamy single soy to the pot and cook for 4-5 min or until thickened to a white sauce-like consistency – this is your plant-based béchamel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the green lentils

Once the garlic is fragrant, add the tomato stock, chopped tomatoes and drained green lentils and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened slightly – this is your lentil & mushroom ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Layer some of the lentil & mushroom ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with 2 lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta

Repeat this process twice until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets (you may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish)

Cover with the plant-based béchamel, top with the grated cheeze and a grind of black pepper, then cook in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the lasagne is cooking, combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl

Season with a small pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash the salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lentil & mushroom lasagne with the salad to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
