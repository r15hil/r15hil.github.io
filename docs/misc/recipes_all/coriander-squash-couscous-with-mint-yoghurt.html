<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the squash is fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [400ml] </span>boiled water

Add the couscous to a heatproof bowl with the vegetable stock, cover and set aside to cook</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the butternut squash cubes to the pan with the ground coriander and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min further – this is your coriander squash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the natural yoghurt, most of the chopped mint leaves (save some for garnish!), the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1] </span>lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl

Give everything a stir – this is your mint yoghurt

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coriander squash over the couscous with the cucumber batons to the side

Drizzle over the mint yoghurt

Garnish with the flaked almonds, reserved chopped mint leaves, a lemon wedge and a grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
