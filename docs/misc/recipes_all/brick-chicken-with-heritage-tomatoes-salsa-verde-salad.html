<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes into quarters

Add your chopped potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 8-10 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and cover with a piece of tin foil, then a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 12 min, checking occasionally, until the chicken skin is golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Chop your heritage tomatoes in half

Once the potatoes are tender, remove the cling film and add a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Give the seasoned potatoes a good mix up, then set aside to cool down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped parsley, capers, garlic and a pinch of salt and sugar to a pestle & mortar and grind to form a paste

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil with the juice of half your lemon[s] and mix it all together – this is your salsa verde

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Pulse in a food processor instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has had 12 min, remove the smaller pan and discard the tin foil

Turn the chicken thighs over and cook for a final 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your brick chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine half the salsa verde (you'll use the rest later!) with the cooled potatoes, chopped lettuce and heritage tomatoes – this is your heritage tomato & salsa verde salad

Chop the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the heritage tomato & salsa verde salad topped with the brick chicken

Drizzle over the remaining salsa verde and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
