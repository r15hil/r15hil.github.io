<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Sprinkle your cornflour over both sides of the beef patty[ies] and pat down until fully coated – these are your coated patty[ies]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min on one side until slightly charred

Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After 5 min, decrease the heat to medium-high and turn the patties over, then add the Mongolian-style BBQ sauce to the pan

Reserve the bowl

Cook for 5 min further, spooning the sauce over the patty[ies] until thickened to a gravy-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in the reserved bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Slice the brioche bun[s] in half

Remove the tray with the chips from the oven and add the brioche halves, cut side up, then return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble top each brioche base with the sriracha mayo, a handful of quick-pickled mooli slaw, a Mongolian-style BBQ beef patty and a little Mongolian-style BBQ sauce then top with a brioche lid

Add any remaining Mongolian-style BBQ sauce to a small pot

Serve the remaining quick-pickled Mooli slaw and chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
