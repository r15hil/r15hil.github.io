<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then chop your paneer into bite-sized pieces and add to the pan, then cook for 3-5 min, turning once halfway until beginning to turn golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your curry powder and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with the paneer and cook for 10 secs

Add your tomato paste and tomato wedges and cook for 1 min further, stirring until fully combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then add it to the pan with a small splash of cold water and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until wilted

Once wilted, remove the pan from the heat and stir your natural yoghurt through the sauce â€“ this is your chilli paneer masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the chilli paneer masala with the brown rice and a warmed garlic & coriander naan to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
