<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once toasted, set aside for later and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 750ml <span class="text-purple">[975ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the onion is softening, add the chopped courgette and your cherry tomatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and your plant based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your arborio rice and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the tomato stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Meanwhile, chop your basil finely, including the stalks, then grind the chopped basil with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste and add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with the olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based 'Nduja & tomato risotto topped with the toasted pine nuts

Drizzle the basil oil over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
