<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Combine the chopped chicken with your ground coriander, half of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>garam masala (save the rest for later!) and a generous pinch of salt in a large bowl – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min, turning occasionally until the chicken is browned

Once done, transfer the browned chicken to a plate (reserve the pan for later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter

Once the butter has melted, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened and starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Once softened, add the chopped ginger and chopped garlic to the pan with your ground turmeric, tomato paste and remaining garam masala and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your chicken stock mix with 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [425ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the browned chicken to the pan and increase the heat to high, then cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Fluff the basmati rice with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with salt – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your clotted cream – this is your butter chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the free range butter chicken over the coriander rice

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
