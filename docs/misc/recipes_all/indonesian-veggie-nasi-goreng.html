Once hot, add the chopped coriander stems (keep the leaves for later!)&nbsp;garlic,&nbsp;spring onion, green beans,&nbsp;ground&nbsp;turmeric and chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)&nbsp;with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the&nbsp;cooked rice to the pan and cook for 2 min&nbsp;


Add the shredded Chinese leaf and cook for a further 1 min only (you want to cook it quickly so it keeps a little crunch!)


Stir in the soy sauce and&nbsp;grated carrot&nbsp;- this is your vegetable&nbsp;fried rice&nbsp;


Divide the&nbsp;vegetable fried rice among your serving plates and wipe your pan clean for the next step&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


Once the pan is hot, crack your&nbsp;eggs into the pan


Cover with a lid and cook for 3 min or until done to your liking


Tip: give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fried eggs over the vegetable fried&nbsp;rice&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;chilli dressing drizzled over


Garnish with the chopped&nbsp;roasted peanuts and reserved coriander leaves


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
