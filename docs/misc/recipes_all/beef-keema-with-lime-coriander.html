<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3 min, or until starting to soften

Once the onion has started to soften, increase the heat to high, then add your beef mince and cook for a further 3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) your ginger

Peel and grate (or finely chop) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has been absorbed, the rice is cooked through and beef mince is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Check and stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom

Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice looks a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Stir the chopped coriander and juice of half your lime[s] through the cooked rice – this is your beef keema

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Chop the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beef keema in a bowl

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
