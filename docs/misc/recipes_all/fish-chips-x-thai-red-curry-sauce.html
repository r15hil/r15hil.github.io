<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and cooked through – these are your chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add half the chopped creamed coconut and your red Thai curry paste to a pot with a lid with half of your soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste, lime leaves, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced to a thick curry-like consistency, then cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your Thai red curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut into quarters

Add your cornflour and 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g] </span><span class="text-danger">[60g] </span>flour to a large bowl with your ground turmeric, remaining soy sauce and the juice of half the lime[s]

Add half the chopped coriander and 80ml <span class="text-purple">[120ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[160ml]</span> very cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your batter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>When the chips are almost done, pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut the fillet[s] in half on a diagonal

Sprinkle both sides of the basa fillet[s] with flour until fully coated, then tap off any excess

Dip the floured basa fillet[s] into the batter and turn it several times until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa fillet[s] to the pan and cook for 4-5 min on each side until cooked through, golden and crispy – this is your turmeric battered fish

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas, remaining chopped creamed coconut and a splash of cold water to a separate pot over a medium heat

Once warm, mash the peas roughly until you have a mix of mushed and whole peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the Thai red curry sauce to a low heat to reheat gently

Once mashed, add the remaining chopped coriander, a squeeze of lime and a pinch of salt to the pot

Give everything a good mix up – these are your coconut & lime mushy peas

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the turmeric battered fish with the chunky chips, coconut & lime mushy peas and Thai red curry sauce to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
