<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] into discs on the diagonal

Peel and chop your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Add your chicken breast strips to a bowl with half your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the courgette discs and onion wedges to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with your ground sumac, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add the marinated chicken to the other side of the baking tray[s] and put in the oven for 15-18 min or until the veg is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa chicken & roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, stir through your chicken stock mix until dissolved, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Add the sliced shallot to a bowl with half your red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, dice your tomato[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced tomato, tomato paste, remaining red wine vinegar and remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 2-3 min or until the tomato starts to break down

Add 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water, then cook for 6-8 min further, stirring frequently, or until thickened and sticky – this is your spiced tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the sauce is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water in a bowl – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked rice with the harissa chicken & roasted veg to the side

Drizzle over the spiced tomato sauce and garlic mayo

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
