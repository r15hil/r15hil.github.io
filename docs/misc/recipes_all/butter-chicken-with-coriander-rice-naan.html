<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the chicken to the pan and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with salt – this is your coriander rice</p><br><br>

<p>Add the plain naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until cooked through

Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the clotted cream – this is your butter chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the butter chicken over the coriander rice with the warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves
