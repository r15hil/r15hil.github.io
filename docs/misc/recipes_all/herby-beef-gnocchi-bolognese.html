<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi</p><br><br>
