<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle, then rinse your sushi rice under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the sushi rice to an oven-proof dish with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water, cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, transfer the rice to a plate and set aside for 10 min or until the rice is cooled</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Meanwhile, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, throw the watery seeds away, then slice finely

Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and grate your garlic

Combine half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and the grated garlic in a bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar – this is your dipping sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the diced chicken breast to a bowl with the remaining soy sauce, then set aside to marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and your mayo in a bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water

Add the edamame beans to a bowl with half of the sriracha mayo (save some for garnish!) and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your edamame salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to coat the base of the pan) over a high heat

Add your cornflour to the marinated chicken and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy soy chicken breast</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooled, roll into 3 balls per person (clean hands are the best way!) – these are your sushi rice balls

Tip: Use wet hands to make it easier!

Drain your quick-pickled cucumber, reserve the pickling liquid

Combine the reserved pickling liquid and the dipping sauce and serve it to the side</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy soy chicken breast with the sushi rice balls, edamame salad and quick-pickled cucumber to the side

Drizzle the remaining sriracha mayo over the rice balls and sprinkle over your shichimi togarashi (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
