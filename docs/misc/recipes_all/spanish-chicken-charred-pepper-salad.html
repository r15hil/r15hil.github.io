<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces and add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Sprinkle your dried oregano all over, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mix everything together, then add your chicken thighs and turn them several times until they're fully coated in all the spices – this is your paprika chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the paprika chicken to the tray with the onion and tomato and drizzle everything with olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the vegetables have softened

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your mayo with your red wine vinegar and your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl

Add the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with a pinch of salt to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your spicy aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into rough, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped pepper and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, until starting to char and soften – this is your charred pepper</p><br><br>

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced paprika chicken thigh with the charred pepper, crispy potatoes, roasted onion and tomato over the salad – this is your Spanish-style chicken thigh & charred pepper salad

Drizzle the spicy aioli all over
