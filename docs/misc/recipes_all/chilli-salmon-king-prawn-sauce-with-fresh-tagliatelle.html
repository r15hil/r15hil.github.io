<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the onion is softening, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your tomato paste and vegetable stock mix in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[390ml] </span>boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the sliced garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and halved cherry tomatoes with a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar and cook for 4-5 min or until the tomatoes have completely softened and the sauce has thickened

Tip: Squash the cherry tomatoes with the back of a spoon to release their juices!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have softened, drain your king prawns, then add them to the pan with your salmon flakes and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your chilli salmon & king prawn sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Combine the salad and balsamic vinegar in a bowl with a drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil - this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli salmon & king prawn sauce with fresh tagliatelle in a bowl with the dressed salad to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
