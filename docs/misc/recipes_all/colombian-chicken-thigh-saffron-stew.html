<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken thigh fillets with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the chicken stock mix and saffron in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water – this is your saffron stock

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and pepper have softened, add the ground cumin, ground turmeric and garlic with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min

Add the browned chicken, halved waxy potatoes, chopped tomatoes and saffron stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Once the potatoes and chicken are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and pull the chicken apart into large chunks using two forks

Add the chopped coriander, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Colombian-style chicken thigh & saffron stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Colombian-style chicken thigh & saffron stew with the basmati rice to the side
