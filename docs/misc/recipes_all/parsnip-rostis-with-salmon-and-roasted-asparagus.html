Put 3 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> butter in a pot with the dried sage, the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1] </span>lemon, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Once done, gently transfer the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea towel and season them with salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the salmon flakes over the parsnip röstis

Top with a poached egg and pour over any remaining butter sauce from the pot
