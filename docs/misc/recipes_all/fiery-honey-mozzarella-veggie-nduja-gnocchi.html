<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for an initial 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add your pepper strips to the pan with the gnocchi and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the pepper has started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into small, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has started to soften, reduce the heat to medium

Add most of your plant based ‘Nduja (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan with your chopped garlic and tomato paste

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix with 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [70ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [90ml]</span> cold water and mix until fully combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top the gnocchi with the torn mozzarella

Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 3-4 min or until the mozzarella has melted – this is your mozzarella & veggie ‘Nduja gnocchi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the gnocchi is cooking, combine your honey with the remaining plant based ‘Nduja (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until bubbling – this is your hot honey

Add your balsamic vinegar to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper and whisk together

Wash your salad and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then add to the bowl with the dressing and toss together – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mozzarella & veggie ‘Nduja gnocchi with the dressed salad to the side

Drizzle the gnocchi with the hot honey

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
