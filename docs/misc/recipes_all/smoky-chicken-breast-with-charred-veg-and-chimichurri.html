<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up then put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half

Add the ground smoked paprika to a large bowl with the ground coriander, chicken stock mix, 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add the chicken breast portions and tomato halves to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – these are you marinated chicken breasts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had an initial 10 min, remove the tray from the oven and crush the potatoes slightly with a potato masher

Add the marinated chicken breasts to the tray

Return the tray to the oven for a final 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are crispy – these are your smoky chicken breasts, roasted tomato & crispy roasties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the diced shallot to a small bowl with the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), grated garlic and chopped parsley

Add 3 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [6 tbsp]</span> olive oil, red wine vinegar and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up - this is your chimichurri dressing

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail and chop the courgette<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, then cut in half widthways

Top, tail and chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly, then cut in half widthways

Thread the chopped courgette and leek widthways onto the soaked skewers, alternating as you go – these are your veg skewers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the veg skewers to the pan (flat-side down) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until charred

Once charred, add a splash of cold water to the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 7-8 min or until the veg is tender – these are your charred veg skewers</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky chicken breasts with the roasted tomato, crispy roasties and charred veg skewer to the side

Drizzle the chimichurri dressing over everything

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
