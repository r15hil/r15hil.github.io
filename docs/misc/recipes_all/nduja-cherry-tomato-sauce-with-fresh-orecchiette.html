<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once hot, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
