<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate, a splash of milk to a shallow bowl and your panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate

Coat your chicken breast strips in the flour, tap off any excess, then add to the milk and firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and half the grated carrot (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add your curry powder with your ginger & garlic paste and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your soy sauce to the pot with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water, the chopped creamed coconut and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give everything a good mix up and cook over a low heat for 5-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Once thickened, blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender, then add a small pinch of salt, cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu curry sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the breaded chicken strips and cook for 5-6 min on each side, until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken strips

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Top half of each warmed tortilla with the shredded lettuce, remaining grated carrot, crispy chicken strips and a drizzle of the katsu curry sauce

Tip: Go light on the filling on your first one so that you don't overfill the burritos!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fold the sides of each tortilla in and wrap the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, tucking it in tightly

Roll the tortilla until you’re left with a burrito – these are your crispy chicken katsu curry burritos

Wrap the crispy chicken katsu curry burritos in tin foil to hold everything together, then slice in half

Serve any remaining katsu curry sauce to the side, get dipping and enjoy!</p><br><br>
