<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then peel and roughly chop the ginger and garlic

Add both to a food processor and blitz until finely chopped, then add half to a large bowl and set aside

Strip the mint leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Add the mint leaves, coriander (including the stalks) and a pinch of salt to the food processor with a splash of water and blitz again for 10-15 secs or until paste-like</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the coriander & mint paste to a bowl with the natural yogurt and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby raita</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly chop 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> red onion (you'll use the rest later!) into large bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped onion to the food processor with the lean beef mince and blitz for 10-20 secs or until the mixture starts to come together

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Add the lean beef and onion mix to the garlic & ginger bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the egg, panko breadcrumbs, ground cumin, garam masala and a generous pinch of salt and black pepper

Give everything a really good mix up then shape the mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> patties (clean hands are the best way!)

Add the patties to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and drizzle with vegetable oil – these are your lean beef chapli kebabs

Put into the oven for 15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a lid over a medium heat with a knob of butter and let it melt

Once melted, add the basmati rice with the saffron and stir to coat in the butter

Add 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges

Peel and finely slice the remaining onion

Add the chopped tomatoes and sliced onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your red onion & tomato salad</p><br><br>
