<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate with a generous drizzle of olive oil and mix together (this will make your breadcrumbs golden!)

Season the chicken breast strips with salt, then coat them in the flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly</p><br><br>
