<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the coconut cream from the sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and chop it roughly


Dissolve the chopped coconut&nbsp;cream and the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in&nbsp;350ml <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water - this is your coconut stock&nbsp;

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely</p><br><br>

Add the sweetcorn&nbsp;(no need to drain) and the green pak choi&nbsp;and cook for 1-2 min or until the greens have wilted - this is your&nbsp;sunny broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and shred the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> apart in the pan, using two forks - this technique is known as &lsquo;pulling&rsquo;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the cooked noodles and shredded chicken between serving bowls


Pour the sunny broth over and garnish with the chopped spring onion and a good squeeze of lime&nbsp;
