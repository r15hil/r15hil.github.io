<p><strong>Description:</strong> Traditional risotto has been given a Gousto makeover. We've swapped the traditional arborio rice for spelt, an ancient healthy wholewheat, which gives the risotto a coarse, nutty texture. We use half of the Italian hard cheese to form delicious cheese crisps which sit atop. </p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the shoaxing wine and cook for 10 sec, then add the spelt and cook for 1 min&nbsp;


Add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring occasionally for 30-35 min or until all the stock is absorbed and the spelt is cooked

<h4>Step 8</h4>

Garnish with the golden courgette and cheese crisp


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
