<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over high heat

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife, remove the skin and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken breast to the dish with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook until very lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes and crushed garlic to the dish and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Sprinkle in your chicken stock mix, add your sun-dried tomatoes and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[400ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Nestle the potatoes into the stock as much as you can!

Bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are tender – this is your one-pot creamy sun-dried tomato & chicken stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, remove the dish from the oven and stir your crème fraîche through the one-pot creamy sun-dried tomato & chicken stew

Roughly tear your basil leaves over the top

Season with a grind of black pepper and sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese
