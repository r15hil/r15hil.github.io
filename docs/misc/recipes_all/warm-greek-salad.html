<p><strong>Description:</strong> This warm Greek salad has all the elements of the summery classic; red onion, tomatoes, herbs and feta, but is served as a warm salad rather than cold. Rustic ciabatta croutons add crunch and the salad is finished with the citrusy spice 'sumac', for a zingy finish.</p>
