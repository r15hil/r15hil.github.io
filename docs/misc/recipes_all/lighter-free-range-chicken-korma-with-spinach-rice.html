<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Chop your tomato[es] finely

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until softened

Meanwhile, chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped chicken and cook for 2-3 min or until browned all over

Once browned, add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, your curry powder, ground turmeric and your ground almonds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and tomato stock and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can, then chop it roughly

Stir the chopped spinach and a pinch of salt through the basmati rice – this is your spinach rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Once the curry has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through your natural yoghurt – this is your lighter chicken korma</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lighter free range chicken korma with the spinach rice to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
