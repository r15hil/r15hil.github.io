<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside (reserve the pan!), these will finish cooking in the sauce later</p><br><br>
