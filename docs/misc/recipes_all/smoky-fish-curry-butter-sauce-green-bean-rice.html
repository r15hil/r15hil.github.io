<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the chopped green beans, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, add a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your green bean rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter to a bowl and mix together with your ground turmeric and curry powder, then season with a pinch of salt – this is your curry butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the curry butter (save the rest for later!) over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once melted, turn the heat down to medium, add your smoked basa fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Once done, transfer to a plate, set aside and reserve the pan – this is your smoky basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the halved cherry tomatoes and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> cold water to the reserved pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 min or until the tomatoes start to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the remaining curry butter and clotted cream to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook for 2 min further or until the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your curry sauce

Once thickened, return the smoky basa to the pan and cook for a further 1 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky basa over the green bean rice

Pour over any remaining curry sauce and garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
