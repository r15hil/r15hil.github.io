<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Slice your potato[es] (skins on) into thin discs

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Add the sliced potato and onion wedges to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[200ml] </span>warm water and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop

While the yeast is developing, drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim the woody ends off your asparagus, then cut the trimmed asparagus in half, lengthways

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add your pizza base mix to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut into 1 per person

Toss each dough ball in a light dusting of flour until coated, rounding the ball as you go (no need to knead!)

Press each dough ball in the centre and gently push outwards with your fingertips, leaving the rim of the pizza untouched to form a crust (don't worry if the dough rips, just stick it back together and carry on!)

Tip: Dust with extra sprinkles of flour as you go to stop it sticking!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Keep going until your base is slightly bigger than a side plate – this is your pizza base

Remove the tray[s] with the potato and onion from the oven and transfer the cooked veg to a clean board, discard the baking paper

Add the pizza base[s] to the tray[s] and top with the cooked potato and chopped garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the torn mozzarella and crumble over the goats' cheese

Separate the cooked onion wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals (careful they may be hot!), then add the onion petals and finally the sliced asparagus

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and add a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the cheese has melted and the crust has puffed up and browned – this is your DIY asparagus, potato & double cheese pizza bianca

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!

Wash your salad and combine your cider vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl with a pinch of sugar and salt

When the pizza is almost ready, toss the salad through the dressing</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the DIY asparagus, potato & double cheese pizza bianca with your red chilli relish dolloped all over

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
