<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, drain your king prawns and add them to the pan with the chopped garlic and most of your ground smoked paprika (save a little for garnish!) and cook for an initial 3 min or until the prawns have started to colour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti reserving a cup of<span class="text-danger"> </span>starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the prawns have started to colour, add your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese to the pan with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up until fully combined</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper, then stir it through the king prawns with your blanched peas and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the spinach has wilted, the sauce has thickened slightly and the prawns are cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with a good grind of pepper and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mix up until the butter has melted and the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your smoky garlic king prawn & pea spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash more starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky garlic king prawn & pea spaghetti topped with the remaining ground smoked paprika

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
