<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and slice your red onion[s] into rings (roughly 0.5cm thick)

Tip: Pop out the centres so that you have different sized rings!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion rings

Cook for 4-5 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

Once softened, transfer the cooked onion to a clean plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your tuna

Combine the drained tuna and your mayo in a bowl with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tuna mix

Grate your cheddar cheese finely

Slice your ciabatta[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the tuna ciabatta[s] and cover with a smaller pan

Add a heavy weight (eg. several tins) to the top pan and cook for 4-5 min per side, checking occasionally or until the ciabatta is golden and the cheese has melted – this is your tuna & red onion melt</p><br><br>

<p>Wash your baby leaf salad and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the tuna & red onion melt in half on the diagonal

Serve the halved tuna & red onion melt with the wedges and baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
