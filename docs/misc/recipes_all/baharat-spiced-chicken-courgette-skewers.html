<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil half a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into 6 pieces per person, then chop half your pepper[s] into bite-sized pieces and half your red onion[s] into chunks (save the rest for later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your baharat, red onion chunks, chopped pepper and chopped chicken to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until nicely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Thread the chicken, pepper and onion chunks onto the skewers, alternating as you go – these are your chicken skewers

Transfer the chicken skewers to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your baharat chicken & pepper skewers</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced pepper and cook for 2 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your spiced rice</p><br><br>
