<h4>Step 1</h4>

Add the rinsed red lentils to a pot with plenty of cold water, then bring to the boil over a high heat and reduce to medium-low and cook for 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender

Once done, drain and return them to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and add them to a tin foil-lined tray (or two!)

Sprinkle over your curry powder and turn the haddock bites several times until they're fully coated

Lightly drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and put the tray[s] in the oven for 7-8 min or until cooked through – this is your curried haddock

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the red lentils are cooked, add them to the pan with the green lentils and the spinach and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted and the lentils are warmed through – this is your spinach & turmeric dal</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried haddock over the spinach & turmeric dal with the cucumber salad to the side

Dollop over the coriander yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
