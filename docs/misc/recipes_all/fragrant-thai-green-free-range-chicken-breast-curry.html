<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your lemongrass, basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

Slice your red chilli[es] in half and scrape the seeds out with a spoon, and chop your coriander roughly, reserving some leaves for garnish

Add the ginger, garlic, half of the red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped coriander to a food processor with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span>[4 tbsp] </span>water and blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry paste</p><br><br>

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water, add your fish sauce with your lime leaf[ves], the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your fragrant stock</p><br><br>
