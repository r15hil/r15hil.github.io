<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek and a knob of butter and cook for 5-6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the leek is cooking, zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter), then cut in half

Peel half your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings and grate the rest

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, add the chopped tomatoes to the pan with the chopped garlic, most of the chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 5-6 min or until the tomatoes have softened, then remove from the heat and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray (or two!) (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a little drizzle of olive oil and pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 8 min or until tender

After the initial 8 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top with your flaked almonds

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3-4 min or until the almonds are golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot of boiled water over a high heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Break your lasagne sheets into medium-sized pieces and add them to the boiling water, stirring to separate the pasta pieces – these are your pasta stracci

Cook for 7-9 min, stirring from time to time to prevent the pasta from sticking, then drain the cooked pasta stracci, reserving a little starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan with the tomatoes to a medium heat

Once hot, add your crab meat, vegetable stock mix, grated Italian hard cheese (you’ll use the shavings later!), cooked pasta stracci and a splash of starchy pasta water

Cook for 1 min, then remove from the heat and stir through your soft cheese, most of the lemon zest, a squeeze of lemon juice and a generous pinch of pepper – this is your creamy crab & chilli stracci</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Serve the creamy crab & chilli stracci topped with the remaining lemon zest, chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the cheese shavings

Serve the salad with the charred Tenderstem & toasted almonds to the side, then drizzle with olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
