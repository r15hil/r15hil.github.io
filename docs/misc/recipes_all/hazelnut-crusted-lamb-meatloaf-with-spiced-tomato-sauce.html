<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Using clean hands, combine half of the ras el hanout (save the rest for later!) and the chopped garlic in a large bowl with the lamb mince and diced onion

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper then mix thoroughly until well combined – this is your spiced lamb mixture

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the hazelnuts and cumin seeds to a pestle & mortar and grind until roughly ground

Add the ground hazelnuts & cumin seeds to a plate and fully coat the loaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the coated loaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> to a tin foil-lined baking tray

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear

Heat a pot with a matching lid over a medium heat with a knob of butter, the sultanas and a pinch of sugar

Once the butter has melted, add the rice with 225ml<span class="text-danger"> [450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and tomato paste with the remaining ras el hanout and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the cornflour with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and cook for a further 2-3 min or until thickened – this is your spiced tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then chop it roughly

Stir the chopped spinach through the cooked rice – this is your spinach & sultana rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the hazelnut crusted lamb meatloaf into thick slices

Serve the sliced meatloaf over the spinach & sultana rice

Spoon over the spiced tomato sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
