<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Slice the wholemeal rolls in half

Once the pan's hot, add the sliced rolls, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

Reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the cornflour and ground turmeric with a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl – this is your cornflour mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy fish fingers

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Combine the mayonnaise with the white wine vinegar, chopped dill and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dill mayo</p><br><br>

Drizzle any remaining mayo over the shredded little gem
