<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half, add them to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once fork-tender, drain and return to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then crush the seasoned potatoes lightly with a fork – these are your crushed potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk – this is your creamy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once golden, add the diced onion and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add half your ground smoked paprika and 2/3 of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the creamy stock with a grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken & chorizo pie filling

Transfer the chicken & chorizo pie filling to an oven-proof dish and top with the crushed potatoes (reserve the pot!)

Put the dish in the oven for 15-18 min or until golden – this is your chicken & chorizo potato-topped pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the green beans to the reserved pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them), then bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender

Add the remaining chopped garlic and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter to a bowl and put in the microwave for 30 secs or until melted

Once melted, combine with the remaining ground smoked paprika and your saffron – this is your smoky saffron butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken & chorizo potato-topped pie with the green beans to the side

Drizzle over the smoky saffron butter and garnish with the chopped parsley
