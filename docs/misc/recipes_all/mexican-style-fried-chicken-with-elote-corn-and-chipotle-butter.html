<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your tomato paste with half your dried oregano and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and chicken stock mix with a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up until the rice is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is fully coated, add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your red rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining ground smoked paprika (save a pinch for garnish!), remaining dried oregano and your ground coriander in a large bowl with 4 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tbsp]</span> flour and a generous pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chicken thighs to the bowl with 4 tsp <span class="text-purple">[6 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8 tsp]</span> cold water

Give everything a good mix up and, using your hands, scrunch the flour onto the chicken until fully coated – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 9-10 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, season the cooked chicken with a pinch of salt – this is your Mexican-style fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, drain your sweetcorn

Combine the drained sweetcorn with the juice of half your lime[s] (don't like it too sour? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Crumble in your feta and give everything a good mix up – this is your elote corn

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and honey with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt in a small heatproof bowl

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 20-30 secs or until the butter is melted

Give it a good mix up – this is your chipotle honey butter</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style fried chicken with the red rice, elote corn and chipotle honey butter

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish the elote corn with the reserved ground smoked paprika and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
