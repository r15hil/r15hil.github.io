<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then finely chop the portobello mushrooms

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-low heat with a large knob of butter and a generous pinch of salt

Once hot, add the onion and cook for 5-6 min, then increase the heat to high, add the mushrooms and cook for a further 5-7 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and chop the potatoes in half

Add the potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are done, drain and leave them to steam dry, reserving the pot for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the cranberries and pistachios roughly

Grate the cheddar cheese

Drain the lentils

Add the grated cheese, drained lentils, cranberries, pistachios, panko breadcrumbs, dried sage and half the soy sauce to the onion and mushroom pan and mash until chunky

Give everything a good old mix up – this is your nut roast mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a loaf tin (23 x13 x7cm) with non-stick baking paper and grease with vegetable oil

Add the nut roast mixture to the prepared tin, pressing down into the corners and smoothing out the top with a spatula

Roast for 40-45 min in the oven or until golden and firm in the middle

Tip: If you don't have a loaf tin, shape into a log instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the nut roast is in the oven, add the cooked potatoes to a baking tray with a large drizzle of vegetable oil and season generously with salt

Put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until crispy, turning halfway through

While the potatoes are cooking, trim, and halve the Chantenay carrots (no need to peel!)

Trim the ends from the Brussels sprouts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel and quarter the parsnips

Add the Chantenay carrots and parsnips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the carrots and parsnips are starting to soften

After 15 min, add the Brussels sprouts to the tray and return it to the oven for 10 min or until everything has softened – these are your winter roast vegetables</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are roasting, re-boil a kettle

Return the pan to a medium heat with a large knob of butter over a medium heat with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, until you're left with a sandy paste

Gradually stir in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water, the remaining soy sauce and Henderson's Relish and cook for 4 min or until the gravy has thickened

Season with a pinch of sugar and a very generous grind of black pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Gently turn the pistachio & cranberry nut roast out onto a chopping board, let it cool slightly and slice thickly

Serve the nut roast over the gravy with the roast potatoes and winter roast vegetables to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
