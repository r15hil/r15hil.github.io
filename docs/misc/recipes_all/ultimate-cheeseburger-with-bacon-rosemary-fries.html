<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a baking tray (or two!)

Strip your rosemary leaves off their stems, then chop them as finely as possible and discard the stems

Combine the chopped rosemary with a pinch of salt – this is your rosemary salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Sprinkle the rosemary salt over the fries with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of pepper and mix it all together

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp, golden and cooked through – these are your rosemary salted fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, add your beef mince to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and Henderson's Relish

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, mix it all together (clean hands is the best way!), then shape into 1 burger patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add a light covering of vegetable oil to a separate baking tray (use kitchen paper to spread it evenly!), then add the burger patty[ies] and your smoked streaky bacon

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the burger[s] is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the bacon is crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the burger[s] is cooking, combine your mustard ketchup, mayo and tomato ketchup in a bowl – this is your burger sauce

Grate your cheddar cheese

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 whole outer leaf per person and set aside for serving

Chop the remaining lettuce into quarters, then add to a bowl and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper – these are your dressed lettuce wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the burger[s] is almost done, top the patty[ies] with the grated cheese and return the tray[s] to the oven for 3 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheeseburger patty

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche bun halves, cut side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread a little burger sauce onto the toasted brioche base, then pile up with a lettuce leaf, a cheeseburger patty, crispy bacon and top with the toasted brioche lid – this is your ultimate bacon cheeseburger

Serve the ultimate bacon cheeseburger with the rosemary salted fries, dressed lettuce wedges and any remaining burger sauce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
