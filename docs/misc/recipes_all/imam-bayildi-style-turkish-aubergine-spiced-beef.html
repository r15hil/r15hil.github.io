<p><strong>Description:</strong> Imam bayildi translates to ‘the Imam fainted’. Why? Because he was overwhelmed by this headily spiced Turkish treat. Load roasted aubergine halves with a baharat-spiced beef sauce before drizzling it with creamy yoghurt for a one-of-a-kind bite.</p>

Add the scored aubergine halves to a baking tray, cut-side down, and put in the oven for 25-30 min or until the flesh is tender and golden brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes to the pan with the beef stock mix, 75ml<span class="text-danger"> [125ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of sugar

Season with a generous pinch salt and pepper<span class="text-danger"> </span>and give everything a good mix up, then reduce the heat to medium-low

Cook for a further 4-5 min or until it's reduced to a bolognese-like consistency  and the mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) - this is your spiced beef</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rice and top with the roast aubergine and spiced beef

Drizzle with the natural yoghurt and sprinkle over the ground sumac

Season with a generous pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
