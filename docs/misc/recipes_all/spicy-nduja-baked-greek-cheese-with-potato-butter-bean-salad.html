<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato, tear in your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 5-6 min or until softened

Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving

Once the tomato has softened, remove the pan from the heat and add the juice of half your lemon[s] with a grind of black pepper, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your spicy 'Nduja marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your Greek cheese to an oven-proof dish and pour over the spicy 'Nduja marinade

Put the dish in the oven for 8-10 min or until beginning to soften – this is your spicy 'Nduja baked Greek cheese

Meanwhile, add the sliced shallot to a large bowl with the juice of the remaining lemon and a pinch of sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the Greek cheese is in the oven, wash your gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the outer lettuce leaves into rough, bite-sized pieces and shred the inner core

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Drain and rinse your butter beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained potatoes and drained butter beans to the bowl with the dressing

Add half the chopped parsley and half your pumpkin seeds (save the rest for garnish!)

Mix it all together – this is your potato & butter bean salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the torn lettuce and shredded lettuce with the potato & butter bean salad, then spoon the spicy ‘Nduja baked Greek cheese over the top

Drizzle over any remaining spicy ‘Nduja marinade and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and remaining pumpkin seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
