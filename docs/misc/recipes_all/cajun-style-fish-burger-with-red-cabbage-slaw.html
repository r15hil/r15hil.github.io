<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chips are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar

Add your shredded red cabbage, grated carrot and half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) to the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your red cabbage slaw

Combine your mayo and red chilli relish in a bowl – this is your chilli mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> black pepper and a very large pinch of salt on a plate

Mix all the spices together – this is your Cajun-style seasoning</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat your basa fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and then slice in half

Press the halved basa into the Cajun-style seasoning firmly to evenly coat all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa halves and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until the basa is cooked through – this is your Cajun-style basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut your ciabatta[s] in half and add them to a baking tray (or two!), cut-side up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, spread the warmed ciabatta with the chilli mayo and top with the Cajun-style basa and some of the red cabbage slaw

Serve the chips and remaining red cabbage slaw to the side and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
