<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add your curry powder, ground cumin and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant – this is your butter curry paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add half the butter curry paste to a small bowl and set aside for later

Add the remaining butter curry paste to a large bowl with the chicken breast portions, a very generous pinch of salt and a splash of cold water

Give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated butter chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer the marinated butter chicken to one side of a baking paper-lined tray and put the tray in the oven for an initial 12 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, tear your garlic & coriander naan[s] into bite-sized pieces

Once the chicken has had an initial 12 min, add the naan pieces to the other side of the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray to the oven for 7-8 min further or until the croutons are crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your butter chicken and naan croutons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Remove the outer lettuce leaves and shred the inner core

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once everything's done, add the lettuce leaves and shredded core to a large bowl

Add the spiced Caesar dressing and give everything a gentle mix up so it is evenly coated in the dressing – this is your spiced Caesar salad

Slice the butter chicken finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced butter chicken and naan croutons on top of the spiced Caesar salad

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
