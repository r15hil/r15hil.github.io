<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> sugar to a pot over a medium-high heat

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very low and cook for approx. 2-3 min or until it turns into a runny glaze that coats the back of a spoon

Tip: Watch the pan like a hawk to make sure the glaze doesn't burn!

Once done, remove the pot from the heat and set aside until serving – this is your balsamic glaze</p><br><br>
