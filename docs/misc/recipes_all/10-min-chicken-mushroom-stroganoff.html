<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Tear your chestnut mushrooms into rough, bite-size pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh and torn mushrooms to the pan with your ground smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is starting to brown, add your chicken stock mix, Henderson's Relish and a small splash of water to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook, covered, for 6-7 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Add another small splash of water to the pan if it's looking dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more packets, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat

Stir through your soured cream, wilted spinach, Dijon mustard (not a fan of mustard? Just add a little!) and a pinch of black pepper – this is your chicken & mushroom stroganoff</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken & mushroom stroganoff with the cooked rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
