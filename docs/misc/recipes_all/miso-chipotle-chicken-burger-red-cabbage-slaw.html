<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/ 180&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips


Add the&nbsp;chips&nbsp;to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up


Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the&nbsp;chips&nbsp;are golden and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat


Cut the&nbsp;brioche rolls&nbsp;in half


Once hot, add the&nbsp;brioche, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place your hand flat onto the chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces


Add the cornflour to a shallow bowl with a pinch of salt&nbsp;


Add the&nbsp;chicken breast pieces&nbsp;to&nbsp;the corn&nbsp;flour and coat well&nbsp;

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the brioche pan to a medium-high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil&nbsp;


Once hot, add the chicken breast pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate approx. 250g&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[500g]</span>&nbsp;red cabbage&nbsp;(use the root as a handle and discard at the end!)


Combine&nbsp;the&nbsp;grated red&nbsp;cabbage, mayonnaise, red wine vinegar&nbsp;with a very generous pinch of salt and give everything a good old mix up &ndash; this is your red cabbage slaw&nbsp;


Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the chicken to kitchen paper and wipe the pan clean


Return the pan to a medium heat and add the miso&nbsp;and chipotle&nbsp;paste&nbsp;with a splash of water


Whisk until fully combined and cook for 2 min or until thickened and warmed through

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once thickened,&nbsp;return&nbsp;the chicken breast pieces to the pan&nbsp;and turn until fully coated&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble the&nbsp;brioche rolls&nbsp;with some of the red cabbage slaw, the miso-chipotle chicken pieces&nbsp;and a sprinkling of spring onion


Serve the chips and any remaining red cabbage slaw to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
