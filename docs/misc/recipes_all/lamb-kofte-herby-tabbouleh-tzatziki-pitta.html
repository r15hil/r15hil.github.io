<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with your lamb mince

Add a generous pinch of both salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the lamb mince and shape into 3 koftes per person</p><br><br>
