<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into strips

Coat the tofu in your curry powder

Once softened, transfer the pepper and onion to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat (no need to clean!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles and return to the large bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add the chopped creamed coconut and your peanut butter to a bowl and add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water

Whisk everything together until you have a smooth paste

Stir your soy sauce, red chilli relish and chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) into the paste â€“ this is your satay dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the lettuce wedges, cooked pepper and onion to the bowl with the drained noodles

Give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the easiest way!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried tofu strips over the noodle salad

Drizzle the satay dressing over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
