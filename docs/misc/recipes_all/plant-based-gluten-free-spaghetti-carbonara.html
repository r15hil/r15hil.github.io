<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free bacon lardons and cook for 4-5 min or until golden and crispy all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the crispy meat-free bacon to a bowl and return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the garlic is fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your creamy single oat, white miso paste and remaining cider vinegar

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, stir the cooked spaghetti through the sauce with half the crispy meat-free bacon (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce – this is your plant-based gluten free spaghetti carbonara

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if the sauce is a little thick!

Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based gluten free spaghetti carbonara and top with the reserved crispy meat-free bacon and a grind of black pepper

Combine the rocket and diced tomato, then serve to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
