<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then boil a kettle

Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Remove 20g <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> butter from the fridge to soften

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble and tear (or chop) the portobello and chestnut mushrooms into the pan

Cook for 6-7 min or until caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are caramelising, chop the parsley, including the stems, very finely

Peel and grate (or finely chop) the garlic

Carefully cut the ciabatta<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into 6-8 slices, without going all the way through the base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray with tin foil

Spread the garlic butter between the slices of ciabatta then add the sliced ciabatta to the tray

Sprinkle with a 1/3 of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until the cheese is starting to brown - this is your garlic bread</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the garlic bread is cooking, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water

Once the mushrooms have caramelised, add the Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs, then add the vegetable stock

Cook for 4-5 min or until reduced to a pasta sauce-like consistency

Stir through the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and the creme fraiche</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine to the sauce and give everything a good old mix up – this is your mushroom linguine

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Wash the rocket and pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom linguine in bowls and top with the rocket

Drizzle with the truffle flavoured extra virgin olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
