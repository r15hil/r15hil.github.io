<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the base of your naans from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s], then combine the sliced shallot with your red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince and cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, spread your mango chutney over your naan[s]

Add the mango naan[s] to the warmed baking tray[s] and top them with the spiced beef mince

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 5-10 min or until golden – this is your beef keema naan[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the naan[s] is in the oven, cut your cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add the grated cucumber, your natural yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beef keema naan[s] with a dollop of cucumber raita

Garnish with the quick-pickled shallot

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
