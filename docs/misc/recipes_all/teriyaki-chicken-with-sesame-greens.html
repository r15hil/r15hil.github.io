<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your mangetout to a large bowl and cover them in boiled water until fully submerged

Set aside to soften

In a separate small bowl combine your soy sauce, honey and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your teriyaki sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the teriyaki sauce and half the sliced spring onion (save some for garnish!) to the pan

Cook for 5-6 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened slightly – this is your teriyaki chicken

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, drain the softened mangetout, then return to the bowl

Add your toasted sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the teriyaki chicken with the cooked rice and sesame greens to the side

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
