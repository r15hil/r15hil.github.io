<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) 3 <span class="text-danger">[6]</span> garlic cloves

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced chorizo and cook for 5-6 min or until crisped and caramelised

While the chorizo is cooking, cut each chicken breast into 6, so that you end up with 12<span class="text-danger"> [24] </span>thin strips

Dissolve the chicken stock mix and saffron in 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L] </span>boiled water – this is your saffron stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the chorizo is crispy, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min further until softened

Add the paella rice, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> smoked paprika and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>tomato frito (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the spices

Add half the chicken strips, stir in the saffron stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, then cover with a lid and cook for an initial 20 min or until the stock has almost absorbed and the rice is cooked with a slight bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the paella is cooking, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized cubes

Add the potato cubes to a baking paper-lined baking tray (cooking for 4? Use two trays!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 20 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> garlic clove<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Roll the lemons<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half

Combine the mayo, chopped garlic and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon in a small bowl

Season with both salt and pepper, add a drizzle of olive oil and whisk to combine – this is your aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> smoked paprika to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together

Turn the remaining chicken strips in the smoked paprika several times until they're fully coated – these are your smoky chicken strips

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the remaining garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 20 min, remove the lid from the paella and add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Increase the heat to medium-low for the final 10 min (this will help with caramelisation) – this is your smoky chicken & chorizo paella

Remove the crispy potatoes from the oven and crowd them together on one side of the baking tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Dollop the remaining tomato frito over the top with the remaining smoked paprika and a very generous grind of black pepper – these are your patatas bravas

Add the smoky chicken strips to the other side of the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to the oven for a final 8-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the chicken strips are almost cooked, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the remaining sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened add the king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Finally, add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon with 1/3 of the chopped parsley and give everything a good mix up – these are your garlic prawns</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Set the smoky chicken & chorizo paella in the centre of the table, ready to share with the patatas bravas, garlic prawns, smoky chicken strips, garlic & herb olives and aioli in bowls – this is your tapas feast

Sprinkle the remaining parsley over the paella and the patatas bravas

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
