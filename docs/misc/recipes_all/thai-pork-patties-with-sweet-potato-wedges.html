<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a large baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sweet potato wedges are cooking, trim and finely slice your spring onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger and garlic

Separate your coriander from your mint, then strip the mint leaves from their stalks and roughly chop the leaves (discard the stalks)

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a large bowl with your chopped ginger and garlic, panko breadcrumbs, soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced spring onion, chopped coriander and chopped mint

Mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<p>Divide and shape the pork mixture into 2 patties per person – these are your Thai-style pork patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the Thai-style pork patties, press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Tip: Cooking for 3? You may need to do this in batches!

Flip the Thai-style pork patties and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and finely slice your radishes

Peel lengths off your cucumber[s] until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Cut your lime[s] into 4 <span class="text-purple">[6]</span> <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>wedges

Add the sliced radishes and cucumber ribbons to a bowl with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime wedge[s], a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil

Gently mix it all together – this is your quick-pickled radish salad</p><br><br>

<p>Add your chilli relish to a bowl with the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime wedge[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and mix to combine – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style pork patties with the sweet potato wedges and quick-pickled radish salad to the side

Dollop over the sweet chilli sauce and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
