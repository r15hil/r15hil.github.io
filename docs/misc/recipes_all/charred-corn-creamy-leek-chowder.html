Once ready, transfer the charred corn to a bowl, reserve the baking tray

Add the garlic ciabattas to the reserved tray and put the tray under the grill for 3-4 min or until golden and toasted – these are your garlic toasts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chowder in bowls and taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed

Top with the charred corn, chopped parsley and chopped chives – this is your charred corn & creamy leek chowder

Slice the garlic toasts into triangles and sprinkle over the smoked sea salt – these are your smoked salt toasts

Serve the smoked salt toasts to the side and enjoy!</p><br><br>
