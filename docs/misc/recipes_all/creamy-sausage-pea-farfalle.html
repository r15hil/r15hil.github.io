<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, squeeze your sausage meat from the skins into the pan (clean hands is the best way!) and discard the skins

Break the sausage meat up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and cook for 5-7 min or until crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 125ml <span class="text-purple">[190ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat is crispy, add the chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock and soft cheese and give everything a good mix up until combined – this is your creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the juice of the remaining lemon and a drizzle of olive oil to a large bowl and add the salad

Give it a good mix up – this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy sausage & pea farfalle with the salad to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
