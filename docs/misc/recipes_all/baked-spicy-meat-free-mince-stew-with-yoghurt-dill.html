<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into quarters

Finely slice half the red onion quarters<span class="text-danger"> </span>and set aside in a small bowl</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the dish with the red onion quarters and crushed garlic

Cook for 2-3 min, breaking the meat-free mince into large chunks with a wooden spoon, until very lightly browned

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Stir in your vegetable stock mix

Add your chopped tomatoes, ras el hanout, harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, stir everything together, then put the dish in the oven for 40 min or until thickened and cooked through – this is your baked spicy meat-free mince stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, pour your red wine vinegar over the sliced red onion and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Tip: Check the stew halfway and give everything a good stir!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the stew is almost done, add your naan[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, dollop your natural yoghurt over the baked spicy meat-free mince stew and tear your dill and parsley all over

Top with the quick-pickled red onion and serve with the warmed naan[s] to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper
