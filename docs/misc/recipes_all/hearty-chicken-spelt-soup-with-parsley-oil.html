<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pot (with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and soy sauce in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[900ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.2L]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once softened, add the half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your spelt and bay leaf[ves] to the pot with the chicken stock and a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook, covered, for 30 min or until tender (it will still have a slight bite when cooked)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your chicken breast strips to a baking paper-lined tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 15-18 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining garlic and half the chopped parsley with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your parsley oil

Slice your ciabatta[s] into 3 slices per person

Add the sliced ciabatta to a separate baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-6 min or until the ciabatta is starting to brown – these are your ciabatta toasts</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spelt is tender, add the shredded chicken, spinach and remaining chopped parsley to the pot and cook for 2-3 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your hearty chicken & spelt soup</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hearty chicken & spelt soup and drizzle over the parsley oil

Serve the ciabatta toasts to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
