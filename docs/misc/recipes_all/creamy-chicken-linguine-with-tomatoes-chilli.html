<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain the cooked linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water and set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Add the chopped chicken and the halved cherry tomatoes with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reduce to a medium-high heat and add your Chinese rice wine to the pan and cook for 30 secs, then pour in the tomato stock

Cook for 6-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a pasta sauce-like consistency

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir through a generous knob of butter and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!)

Add the cooked linguine to the sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken linguine with tomatoes and chilli

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken linguine with tomatoes and chilli and sprinkle over the remaining chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
