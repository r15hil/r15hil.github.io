<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Cut the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into small florets and discard the stalk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cauliflower florets and chopped pepper to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened – these are your roasted veggies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the veggies are roasting in the oven, peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion softens, cut the tomatoes into wedges

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Once the onion has softened, add the ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and ground fenugreek and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice, star anise and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim the green beans, then add them to the pan with the tomato wedges, halved red chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato stock

Cook for 5-6 min or until the beans have softened and the sauce has thickened – this is your balti

Add the roasted veggies (save the baking tray for the next step!) to the balti and give everything a good mix up – this is your veggie balti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the flaked almonds to the reserved baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the veggie balti with the fragrant rice to the side (discard the star anise!)

Garnish with the toasted flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
