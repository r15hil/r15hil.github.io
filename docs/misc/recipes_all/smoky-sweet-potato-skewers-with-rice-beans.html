<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into 2 wedges per person, lengthways

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sweet potato wedges to a large bowl with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up

Thread the seasoned sweet potato wedges onto the soaked skewers, lengthways

Add the skewers to a baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through and starting to crisp – these are your smoky sweet potato skewers</p><br><br>
