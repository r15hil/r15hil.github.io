Slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Combine your rice vinegar, 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1/4 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>water in a bowl and gently stir it all together

Add the chilli rounds to the bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, reboil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then dissolve it in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water with the vegetable stock mix – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add your garam masala and ground turmeric and cook for 30 secs further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Stir 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour into the pan, then add the coconut stock and increase the heat to medium-high

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan and cook for 5-8 min, stirring frequently or until it's wilted and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency

Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once thickened, remove the curry sauce from the heat, then drain your king prawns and add them to the pan with the chopped coriander and haddock bites – this is your Indian-style haddock & king prawn pie mix

Tip: Unevenly-sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Transfer the Indian-style haddock & king prawn pie mix to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add your cumin seeds with a splash of milk and a large knob of butter

Mash until smooth and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Top the Indian-style haddock & prawn pie mix with the mash

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the mash is golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your Indian-style haddock & king prawn pie</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the pie from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the Indian-style haddock & king prawn pie with the quick-pickled chilli to the side

Drizzle the pickling liquid all over for extra flavour (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
