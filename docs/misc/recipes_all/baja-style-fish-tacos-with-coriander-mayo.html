<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sliced onion and pepper strips to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until soft and golden – this is your roasted onion & pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, cut your basa fillet[s] into 6 strips per person

Add the basa strips to a bowl, drizzle with your soy sauce and give everything a good mix up – these are your coated basa strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour, ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground cumin with a pinch of salt to a separate bowl and stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Add the coated basa strips to the bowl with the spice mix and gently turn them until they're fully coated – these are your spiced basa strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the spiced basa strips and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crisp and cooked through – these are your crispy basa strips

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)

Combine your mayo with your white wine vinegar, chopped coriander and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl – this is your coriander mayo

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then shred roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, divide the shredded lettuce and roasted onion & pepper between the warmed tortillas

Top each tortilla with 2 crispy basa strips and a drizzle of the coriander mayo – these are your Baja-style basa tacos

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
