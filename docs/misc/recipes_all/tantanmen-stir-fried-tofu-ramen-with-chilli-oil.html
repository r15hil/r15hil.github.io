<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Combine your toasted sesame oil and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your chilli oil</p><br><br>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain and pat your tofu with kitchen paper until completely dry

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crumble the tofu directly into the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until golden

Once golden, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the tofu is cooking, add your white miso paste, rice vinegar, half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to a pot with 800ml <span class="text-purple">[1.1L] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min, stirring well to combine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash, then cut the base off your pak choi and discard, then chop in half

Add your wholewheat noodles to the pot and cook for an initial 4 min or until the noodles are almost cooked

Tip: Separate the noodles with a fork so that they're all submerged in the broth

After an initial 4 min, add the halved pak choi and cook for 2-3 min further or until the noodles are cooked and the pak choi is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the remaining soy sauce and hoisin sauce to the pan with the tofu and cook for 1-2 min or until sticky – this is your stir-fried tofu

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the noodles are cooked, carefully remove the pak choi from the pot and set aside for serving

Add your tahini to the pot with the noodles and give everything a good mix up until the soup is creamy and has thickened slightly – this is your miso sesame ramen

Tip: Stir the noodles to release their starch and give the soup a nice creamy texture</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the wholewheat noodles in a bowl and pour the miso sesame ramen over the top

Top with the pak choi, stir-fried tofu and sliced spring onion – this is your tantanmen-style stir-fried tofu ramen

Drizzle the chilli oil all over (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
