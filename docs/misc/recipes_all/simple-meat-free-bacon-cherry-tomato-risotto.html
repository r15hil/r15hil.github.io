<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the remaining chopped cherry tomatoes when the rice is nearly cooked – this is your cherry tomato risotto

Taste for seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed</p><br><br>

Remove the cooked meat-free bacon from the pan and chop roughly

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cherry tomato risotto in a bowl with the salad to the side

Sprinkle the meat-free bacon over the risotto

Garnish with the remaining spring onion
