<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms to the pan and cook for an initial 3-4 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your couscous to a heatproof bowl with your chopped dates, a generous pinch of salt and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water

Cover and set aside until all of the liquid has been absorbed – this is your date couscous

Fluff with a fork before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel half the carrot[s] until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Grate the remaining carrot

Drain and rinse your chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the Fable pulled mushrooms have started to brown, add your ras el hanout and roasted garlic paste to the pan with your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>flour

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the grated carrot and chickpeas to the pan with your vegetable stock mix

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your Fable mushroom tagine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems and discard the stems

Roughly tear the mint leaves into a bowl

Add the carrot ribbons to the bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> </span>olive oil and your white wine vinegar and give everything a good mix up – these are your minty carrot ribbons</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Fable mushroom tagine with the date couscous to the side

Top with the minty carrot ribbons

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
