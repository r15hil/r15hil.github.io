<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potato and carrot discs to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the potato and carrot are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further

Increase the heat to high and add your beef mince and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Once the mince has browned, add the sliced courgette to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until the courgette has started to soften

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your beef stock mix and harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your harissa stock

Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and your chopped tomatoes and cook for 10-12 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the meat is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your harissa beef mince ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Whilst the beef ragù is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Return the drained potato and carrot to a low heat with half your natural yoghurt, half the chopped parsley and mint (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous pinch of salt

Mash until smooth – this is your herby yoghurt & carrot mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa beef mince ragù with the herby yoghurt & carrot mash to the side

Drizzle over the remaining yoghurt and sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
