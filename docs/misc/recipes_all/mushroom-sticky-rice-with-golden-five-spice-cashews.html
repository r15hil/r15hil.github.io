<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, slice your flat white mushroom[s] roughly

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into wedges, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli tips away from the stalks and slice in half, then chop the broccoli stalks into quarters lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your ginger & garlic paste and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl with your gluten free soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, half your maple syrup and half of your five-spice mix (save the rest for later!)

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your stir-fry sauce

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushroom and onion petals and cook for 4-5 min or until the vegetables are browned and slightly softened

Once browned, reduce the heat to medium-high and add the broccoli tips and stalks to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the broccoli is softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cashew nuts and the remaining maple syrup to a bowl with your toasted sesame seeds, a pinch of salt, a drizzle of vegetable oil and the remaining five-spice mix and give everything a good mix up – these are your five-spice cashews

Add the five-spice cashews to a baking paper-lined baking tray, then put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until the cashews are golden and caramelised – these are your golden five-spice cashews

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the broccoli has softened, add the stir-fry sauce and cooked sushi rice to the pan and mix it all together until fully combined – this is your mushroom sticky rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mushroom sticky rice and top with the chopped coriander and golden five-spice cashews

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
