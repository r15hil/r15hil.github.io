<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Add the chopped ginger and garlic to a heat-proof bowl with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Add your toasted sesame oil and heat for 1-2 min or until very hot, then carefully pour the heated toasted sesame oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later (save the pan!) – this is your chilli oil

Tip: Be careful – the garlic and ginger will sizzle from the heat of the oil!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top, tail and grate your carrot[s] (no need to peel!)

Trim, then slice your mangetout finely on a diagonal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands and cook for 3-4 min or until caramelised

Add half of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) to the pan and cook for 30 secs further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, add the remaining soy sauce, rice vinegar and peanut butter to the chilli oil

Add a pinch of sugar and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your sauce

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the noodles are done, add a splash of the starchy noodle water to the sauce – this is your Sichuan-style chilli sauce

Tip: You want the sauce to be a single cream consistency so it can coat all of the noodles!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the Sichuan-style chilli sauce to the bottom of your serving bowl

Serve the drained noodles on top with the caramelised mushrooms, grated carrot and sliced mangetout

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

Before eating, toss the noodles and veg through the Sichuan-style chilli sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
