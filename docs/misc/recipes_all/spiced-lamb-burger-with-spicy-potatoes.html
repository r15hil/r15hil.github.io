<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-size pieces&nbsp;


Pour 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil onto a baking tray and add half the curry powder (you'll use the rest later)


Add the potatoes to the spiced oil and mix to coat them evenly, then&nbsp;put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are crispy - these are your spiced potatoes&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the lamb mince with the remaining curry powder, 1/3 of the&nbsp;diced onion, half the chopped&nbsp;ginger and half the chopped&nbsp;garlic (you'll use the rest later)


Season the mix with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;salt and plenty of pepper

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil over a medium-low heat


Once hot, add the remaining diced&nbsp;onion and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has softened


Add the diced&nbsp;tomato, remaining chopped&nbsp;ginger and garlic, half the white wine&nbsp;vinegar (keep the rest for step 7) and cook for 10-12 min or until reduced to a chutney-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the brioche rolls&nbsp;in half


Heat a large, dry wide-based pan (or griddle if you have one!) over a high heat


Once hot, add the brioche, cut-side-down and toast them for 3 min or until coloured


Once toasted, set them&nbsp;aside until serving, reserving the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span>&nbsp;vegetable oil


Once hot, add the patties and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked, pressing them down with a spatula to flatten and keep their shape&nbsp;


Tip:&nbsp;once browned, lower the heat to cook through which will prevent the patties drying out</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, shred the little gem lettuce finely


Dress the lettuce with the remaining vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Combine the finished tomato chutney with the mayonnaise and season lightly with salt and pepper - this is your tomato mayo&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Assemble the burgers with the tomato mayo and serve the&nbsp;salad and spiced potatoes to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
