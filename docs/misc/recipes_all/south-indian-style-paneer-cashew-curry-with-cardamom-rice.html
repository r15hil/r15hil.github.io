<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut your paneer into bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) adding a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the cubed paneer and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring

Once cooked, transfer the golden paneer to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 8 min or until softened and browning slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, cardamom pods and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your red chilli[es] finely (deseed by scraping the seeds out with a teaspoon if you can’t handle the heat!)

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your garam masala, tomato paste, most of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pan then cook for 30 secs

Add the chopped tomato and cook for a further 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[510ml]</span> boiled water

Add the vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 5-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the tomato has broken down

Once thickened, return the golden paneer to the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your cashew nuts to a pestle & mortar and bash into a fine powder (or blitz in a food processor)

Add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp] </span>cold water and mix to form a paste

Stir the cashew paste into the pan and cook for 2 min further – this is your South Indian-style paneer cashew curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the South Indian-style paneer cashew curry with the cardamom rice

Discard the cardamom pods from the rice

Garnish with your crispy onions and reserved chopped coriander and reserved chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
