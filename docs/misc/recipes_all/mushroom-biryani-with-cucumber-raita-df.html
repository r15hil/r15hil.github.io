<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Once hot, tear your flat white mushrooms into large pieces, add them to the pan and cook for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, combine your vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, mango chutney and sultanas with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<p>Crumble your chestnut mushrooms into the pan and add your curry powder and roasted garlic paste

Cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the warmed rice to the pan with the tomato stock and increase the heat to high

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 2 min or until the mushrooms have softened – this is your plant-based mushroom biryani</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cucumber and squeeze out any excess water from the grated cucumber

Combine the grated cucumber with your cultured coconut and a pinch of pepper in a bowl – this is your coconut cucumber raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Dollop the coconut cucumber raita over the plant-based mushroom biryani, garnish with your crispy onions and dig in

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
