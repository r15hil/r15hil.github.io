<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!), grated onion, panko breadcrumbs and pepper in a bowl and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the meatball mixture and shape them into 4 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 4-5 min, turning occasionally, or until they’re browned all over

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are browned, transfer them to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock, half the balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp]</span> sugar

Return the browned meatballs to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened

Meanwhile, drain your mozzarella and tear it into rough pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, transfer the meatballs and sauce to an oven-proof dish (or individual dishes)

Top with the torn mozzarella and put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until melted and bubbling – these are your cheesy meat-free meatballs

Meanwhile, combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and some pepper – this is your balsamic dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half, then add them to a baking tray and put in the oven for 1-2 min or until slightly toasted

Once slightly toasted, spread each slice with a little butter and top with the remaining garlic, then return to the oven for a further 3-4 min

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then tear into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy meat-free meatballs with the garlic ciabatta and torn lettuce to the side

Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the lettuce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
