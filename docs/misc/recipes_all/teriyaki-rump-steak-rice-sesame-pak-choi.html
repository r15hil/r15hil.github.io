<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan over a high heat and once very hot, add the steaks 


<span class="text-highlight">For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side</span>


<span class="text-highlight">For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</span>


<span class="text-highlight">For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side</span>


Tip: don’t be tempted to move the steaks around too much in the pan – this will stop them from browning</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the steak pan from the heat, add the honey and soy sauce and give everything a good mix up


Tip: this will cool the pan down and prevent the honey from burning!


Return the pan to a medium-low heat and cook for 3-4 min or until a thick and sticky sauce remains – this is your teriyaki sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Slice the rested steaks finely


Stir any of the resting juices through the teriyaki sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced steak with the rice and sesame pak choi to the side


Tip: for fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out


Pour the teriyaki sauce over everything and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and sliced chilli (Can't handle the heat? Go easy!)


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
