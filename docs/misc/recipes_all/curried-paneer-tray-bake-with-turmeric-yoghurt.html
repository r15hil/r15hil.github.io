<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 12-15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Slice your paneer into 2 strips per person

Sprinkle 2/3 of your curry powder (save the rest for later!) over the sliced paneer and rub it into both sides until evenly coated

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – these are your curried paneer strips</p><br><br>
