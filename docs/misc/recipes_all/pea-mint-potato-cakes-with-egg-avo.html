<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and chop the potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

Mash the potatoes until smooth

Add the blanched peas, sliced spring onion, chopped mint and 1/4 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1/2 tsp]</span> salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your pea & mint potato mixture</p><br><br>

Add the pea & mint potato cakes to a lightly oiled baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper, add it to the dressing and give it a gentle mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan and season with a pinch of salt

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pea & mint potato cakes with the avocado and dressed baby leaf salad to the side

Top with a fried egg and garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
