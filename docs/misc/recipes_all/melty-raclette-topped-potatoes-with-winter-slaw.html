<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cut the waxy potatoes in half

Add the halved potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until fork tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>For fancy presentation, cut the peppered salami in half and roll each half into cone-shapes

Roll the Napoli salami into tubes and cut in half

Tip: Too fiddly? Just break both up into smaller pieces!

Tear the Serrano ham into smaller pieces and add to a serving board with the Napoli salami and salami cones – this is your charcuterie</p><br><br>
