<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Drain your sweetcorn

Once the pan is hot, add the drained sweetcorn with a small pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to char

Once done, transfer to a bowl and set aside for later (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Wipe the reserved pan clean and return to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced shallot and chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water, then return the drained tortiglioni to the pot

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the softened shallot & garlic and half the charred corn (you'll use the rest later!) to a food processor

Blitz until smooth – this is your creamy corn</p><br><br>
