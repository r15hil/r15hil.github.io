<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel your red onion[s] and slice off 1 round per person

Dice the remaining red onion as finely as you can

Tip: Alternatively, pop the remaining red onion into a mini food processor and blitz until finely chopped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the red onion round[s] to a separate tin foil-lined baking tray (or pop them on the tray with the chips if you have space!) and drizzle them with a little olive oil

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until softened and lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the finely chopped onion, beef mince, dried oregano, Henderson's Relish, beef stock mix and a good grind of black pepper to a bowl

Mix together for 1-2 min or until really well combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into equal-sized patties (1 per person!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut 1 thin slice[s] per person from your tomato[es] and set them aside for serving

Chop the remaining tomato roughly

Wash your lettuce, pat dry with kitchen paper, then remove 1 outer leaf per person and set aside until serving

Tear the remaining lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces

Slice your cheddar cheese into 3 slices per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips have been cooking for 20 min, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat

Once hot, add the patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min, reduce the heat to medium-high, flip the patty[ies] and cook for a further 2 min or until nicely browned

Mix most of the torn lettuce (save a handful for later!) and roughly chopped tomato together – this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Top the patty[ies] with the cheese slices and cook, covered, for a further 3 min or until the cheese has melted and the patty[ies] is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, slice your gluten free brioche bun[s] in half and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build the burger top your warmed brioche bun base with a squeeze of tomato ketchup, a reserved lettuce leaf, tomato slices, a cheesy patty, a roasted onion round and the warmed brioche bun lid

Serve with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
