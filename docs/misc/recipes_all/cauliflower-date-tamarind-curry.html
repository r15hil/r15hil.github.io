<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter alternative over a medium-low heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, heat a pot with a lid, with a knob of butter alternative over a high heat

Once melted, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until the cauliflower is tender and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your cauliflower, date & tamarind curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cauliflower, date & tamarind curry over the basmati rice with the kachumber to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
