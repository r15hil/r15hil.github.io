<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and cut your shallots in half

Strip your thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>rectangle per person

Spread your soft cheese evenly over the pastry rectangle[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Drizzle a little olive oil onto the baking paper

Drizzle half your balsamic vinegar (save the rest for later!) over the olive oil, then make 1 pile of thyme leaves per person and top with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot to the pile[s], cut side down

Top with 1/3 of your bacon lardons (you'll use the rest later!) and drizzle over your roasted garlic paste

Season with a grind of black pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Place the puff pastry rectangle[s] over the shallot and lardon pile[s], soft cheese side down, gently pressing down to seal the edges

Brush the puff pastry with a little milk

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or or until the filling is cooked through, the pastry is golden and the edges are puffed up– this is your upside down shallot tart</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and set aside, reserve the pot

While the potatoes are cooking, chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the remaining bacon lardons and cook for 4-5 min or until crispy

Once the bacon is crispy, add the chopped tomatoes to the pot with a splash of cold water and cook for 5-6 min or until slightly softened

Once softened, return the cooked waxy potatoes to the pot with a pinch of salt, give everything a good mix up and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through – these are your bacon lardon potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your baby leaf salad

Serve the upside down shallot tart with the bacon lardon potatoes and baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle a little olive oil over the salad with the remaining balsamic vinegar

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
