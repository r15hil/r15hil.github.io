<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized cubes and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop finely, then combine them with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cubed potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 20 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim, then add your green beans to a pot of boiling water over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, rinse under cold water and set aside for later

Meanwhile, pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then rub with vegetable oil and season both sides with salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat and once very hot, add the seasoned steak[s]

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Tip: Don’t move the steak around too much in the pan – this will stop it from browning</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a clean plate to rest and reserve the pan

Once the potatoes are starting to crisp, sprinkle over the garlic & rosemary mix and cook for 5-7 min further or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your Parmentier potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a low heat and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> cold water and scrape up any meaty bits stuck to your pan with a wooden spoon

Stir in your soy sauce, clotted cream, soft cheese and wholegrain mustard and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a double cream-like consistency (add a splash of water if it's looking a little thick!) – this is your creamy mustard sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Add the remaining chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the cooked green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 1 min further – these are your garlicky green beans

Pour any steak resting juices from the plate into the creamy mustard sauce and slice the rested steak[s] finely on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced rump steak over the creamy mustard sauce with the Parmentier potatoes and garlicky green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
