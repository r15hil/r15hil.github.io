<p><strong>Description:</strong> This lamb keema pav is based on a popular Indian street food dish. It's deliciously comforting, with spiced lamb filling a tasty brioche bun. Raw shallot and fresh coriander give the dish a fantastic burst of freshness, which works brilliantly with the layered spicing of the gunpowder potatoes. </p>
