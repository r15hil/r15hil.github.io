<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped courgette and chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and dice your shallot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>
