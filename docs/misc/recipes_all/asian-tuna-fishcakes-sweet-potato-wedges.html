<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice the spring onions

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain the tuna and add it to a large bowl

Add the soy sauce, panko breadcrumbs, chopped coriander, chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and most of the chopped spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) to the bowl

Add 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>cold water and give it a good mix up then set aside to absorb – this is your Thai-style tuna mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the carrot and cucumber ribbons to a large bowl with the rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled carrot & cucumber ribbons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, transfer the quick-pickled carrot & cucumber ribbons to your serving plates (reserve the bowl and pickling liquid)

Add the natural yoghurt and chilli relish to the bowl with the pickling liquid and give it a good mix up – this is your chilli yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style tuna fishcakes with the sweet potato wedges and pickled carrot & cucumber ribbons to the side

Dollop over the chilli yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
