<h4>Step 2</h4>

Once boiling, add the diced carrot and reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

While the fish is cooking, combine your maple syrup, red chilli relish and 30ml <span class="text-purple">[45ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60ml]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Once the hake pieces are cooked through, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened

Add your sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cook for a further 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your sweet chilli hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Once the rice is cooked, add the refreshed peas and remaining soy sauce and mix everything together – this is your veg-packed rice</p><br><br>

<p>Remove the sweet chilli hake from the heat and add your toasted sesame seeds to the pan

Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the veg-packed rice with the sweet chilli hake over the top

Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
