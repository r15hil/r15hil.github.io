<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, add a couple of splashes of water and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your halloumi into strips

Add the halloumi strips to a bowl with your baharat and give everything a good mix up until the halloumi is fully coated

Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your tahini to a small bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water and stir until the tahini has softened

Add your natural yoghurt and grated garlic and stir it all together – this is your tahini yoghurt dressing</p><br><br>

<p>Add your wholemeal pitta[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine the tomato wedges, mooli slaw mix and salad in a large bowl

Add your cider vinegar, 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and a drizzle of olive oil and toss – this is your salad

Slice the warmed pitta[s] along the top and open up to form a pocket (be careful not to cut all the way through!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Fill each pitta with a handful of the salad, halloumi and tahini yoghurt dressing – this is your Lebanese-style halloumi pitta

Serve the Lebanese-style halloumi pitta with the remaining salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
