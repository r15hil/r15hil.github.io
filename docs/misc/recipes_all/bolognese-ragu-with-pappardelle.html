<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish needs no introduction (but we’ll do one anyway). Authentic ragù alla Bolognese starts with quality meat; beef, pork and bacon, combined to give the dish an incredible depth of flavour. Enhance the richness of the sauce with fresh tomatoes and a splash of milk, true Bolognese-style. Bellissimo!</p>

Stir in 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> milk – this is your stock

Stir the drained pappardelle and chopped basil through the Bolognese ragù and give everything a good mix up – this is your Bolognese ragù with pappardelle 

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
