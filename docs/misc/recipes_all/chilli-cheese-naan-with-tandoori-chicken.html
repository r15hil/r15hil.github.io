<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your ground smoked paprika and curry powder with half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest for later!) in a medium bowl

Add the chicken thighs and sliced pepper to the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the coated chicken thighs and pepper to a baking paper-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until the pepper is slightly charred and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) - this is your tandoori chicken thighs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tandoori chicken is cooked, remove the baking tray from the oven

Transfer the tandoori chicken thighs to a clean board, reserving the tray

Re-line the reserved baking tray with baking paper

Add your naan[s] to the baking tray and top with the grated cheddar, chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and charred pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven for 4 min or until the bread is warmed through and the cheese has melted – this is your chilli-cheese naan

Meanwhile, on a clean board shred the tandoori chicken apart using two forks – this is your pulled tandoori chicken

Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli-cheese naan with the spinach and pulled tandoori chicken thigh layered on top  – this is your chilli-cheese naan with tandoori chicken

Drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt and season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
