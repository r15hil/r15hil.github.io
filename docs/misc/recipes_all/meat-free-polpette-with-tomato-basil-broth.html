<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) with the chopped basil stalks, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once hot, add the polpette and cook for 2-3 min, turning occasionally until browned on all sides

Once browned, set aside on a plate (reserve the pan) – these are your meat-free polpette</p><br><br>
