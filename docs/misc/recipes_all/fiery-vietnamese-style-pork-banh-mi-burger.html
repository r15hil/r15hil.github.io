<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and chopped garlic & ginger in a bowl with half your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pork patties, press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Reduce the heat to medium-high, flip each patty and cook for a further 5 min or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the patties are cooking, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Combine your rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a large bowl

Add your mooli slaw mix, chopped coriander and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your zingy slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Carefully slice them in half before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a small bowl – this is your sriracha mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread each ciabatta base with a little sriracha mayo, then top with the pork burger, a handful of zingy slaw and a ciabatta lid – this is your fiery Vietnamese-style pork bánh-mì burger

Serve the fiery Vietnamese-style pork bánh-mì burger with the chips, remaining zingy slaw and remaining sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
