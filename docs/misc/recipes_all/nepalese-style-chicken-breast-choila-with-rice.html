<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, once hot, carefully add your black mustard seeds and coriander seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant, then transfer to a heat proof bowl and set aside for later, reserve the pan

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook on both sides for 3 min or until browned

Add the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and reserve the pan, then put under the grill for 10-12 min or until charred, caramelised and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your grilled chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic & ginger, diced onion, chopped chilli and chopped tomato to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add your ground turmeric, chicken stock mix and toasted mustard & coriander seeds with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> cold water and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your choila sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Once cooked, transfer the grilled chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the shredded chicken, remaining chopped tomato, sliced spring onion and most of your chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pan with the choila sauce

Add a squeeze of lime juice, season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix – this is your Nepalese-style chicken breast choila

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Nepalese-style chicken breast choila on top of the cooked rice

Garnish with the remaining coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
