<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Top, tail, peel and roughly chop your parsnips and carrot[s], then add them to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 10-15 min or until fork-tender, then once done, drain, return them to the pot and cover to keep warm</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place your hand flat onto your chicken breast<span class="text-danger"> </span>portion[s]

Season the sliced chicken with salt</p><br><br>
