<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Peel and grate your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add half your cherry tomatoes (you'll use the rest later!), tomato paste, grated garlic and 550ml <span class="text-purple">[825ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.1L] </span>boiled water

Break your spaghetti in half and add it to the dish, giving everything a good mix up to separate the strands

Bring to the boil over a high heat, season with salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 25 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pasta has had an initial 25 min, add your diced chorizo and remaining cherry tomatoes to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) along with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-6 min or until the chorizo is crispy and the tomatoes are roasted – this is your crispy chorizo & roasted tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain your king prawns

Remove the pasta dish from the oven

Add the drained king prawns and soft cheese then give everything a good mix up

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for a final 5 min or until the spaghetti is tender and the prawns are cooked through – this is your one-pot creamy king prawn spaghetti</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings

Wash your rocket, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the rocket to a bowl along with a drizzle of olive oil and your white wine vinegar

Add the cheese shavings to the bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your rocket & cheese salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot creamy king prawn spaghetti topped with the crispy chorizo & roasted tomatoes

Serve the rocket & cheese salad to the side

Tear over your basil leaves and season with a grind of black pepper
