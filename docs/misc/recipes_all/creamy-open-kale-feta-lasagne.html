<p><strong>Description:</strong> If you're familiar with spinach and ricotta lasagne, you'll be sure to love this kale and feta version, which delivers way more on the flavour front! An 'open-lasagne' is both quicker and easier than traditional, as it's all done on the hob - lazy lasagne! Served with a sweet baby plum tomato and basil leaf salad. You can't get much feta than that!</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, bring a large&nbsp;pot of boiled water&nbsp;with a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 12 min or until they have softened and cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the garlic, dried&nbsp;oregano and 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span>&nbsp;butter to&nbsp;the pan&nbsp;


Once the butter has melted, stir in 30g <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour&nbsp;and cook for 2 min&nbsp;


Stir 500ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span>&nbsp;milk gradually into the pan&nbsp;


Whisk constantly for 3-5min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains, then add the shredded&nbsp;kale, cover&nbsp;and cook for 3 min or until the kale has started to wilt&nbsp;

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once wilted, crumble the feta into the&nbsp;kale&nbsp;


Remove from the heat, add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and set aside - this is your&nbsp;kale &amp; feta sauce&nbsp;


Grate the cheddar cheese and set aside&nbsp;

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the baby plum tomatoes in half&nbsp;


Strip the basil leaves from the stalks and chop the stalks finely, leaving the leaves whole &nbsp;


Add the chopped&nbsp;tomatoes and the basil leaves (keep the stalks for later) to a bowl with a splash of olive oil and a&nbsp;pinch of&nbsp;salt and pepper


Give everything a gentle mix up - this is your tomato &amp; basil salad

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Check the lasagne sheets are cooked


Once cooked, drain and return them to the pot with a little&nbsp;starchy pasta water (this prevents them from sticking together)


&nbsp;


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, place a lasagne sheet on each plate and spoon over some of the&nbsp;kale &amp; feta sauce&nbsp;


Sprinkle some of the grated cheese and the chopped basil stalks over, then repeat with the remaining lasagne sheets


Serve the&nbsp;tomato &amp; basil salad to the side and enjoy!</p><br><br>
