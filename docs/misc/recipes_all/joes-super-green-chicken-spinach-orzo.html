<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper 

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and spinach with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your orzo to the browned chicken and cook for 30 secs
