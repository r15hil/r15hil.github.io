<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into cubes

Dissolve the miso paste, gochujang paste, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), toasted sesame oil and the soy sauce with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 550ml<span class="text-danger"> [950ml]</span> boiled water – this is your jjigae stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the garlic and ginger are fragrant, add the jjigae stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until boiling

Add the grated carrot and tofu cubes and cook, covered, for 6-8 min further or until the tofu is warmed through – this is your Korean-style tofu jjigae stew

Tip: If you’re still waiting on the rice to cook, reduce the heat to low and leave the stew to simmer</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, trim, then finely slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Korean-style tofu jjigae stew and sticky rice in separate bowls

Garnish the stew with the sliced spring onion

Tip: Add your rice into the stew or eat the stew with a spoonful of rice to absorb all of the broth!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
