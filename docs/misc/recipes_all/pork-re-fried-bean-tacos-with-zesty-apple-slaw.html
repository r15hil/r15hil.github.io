<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add your red wine vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> boiled water to a bowl

Peel and slice half your red onion[s] as thinly as you can, then add to the bowl and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your black beans

Heat a pot with a lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and once hot, add your ground smoked paprika and cook for 10-20 secs or until fragrant

Add the drained black beans, soy sauce and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and season with salt and pepper

Cook, covered, for 10 min or until the beans are very soft</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, finely dice the remaining red onion and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Zest (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!) and juice the lime[s]

Core and slice the apple[s] into matchsticks

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook over a medium heat for 3-4 min or until softened

Add your chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped garlic and pork mince (remove the paper if required!), breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Season with salt and pepper and cook for 7-8 min until the pork is crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the pork mince is cooking, combine the apple matchsticks with the lime juice, lime zest and mayo in a small bowl – this is your zesty apple slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the black beans have softened, add a very large knob of butter to the pot and mash them to a coarse paste – these are your refried beans

Drain the quick-pickled onion, discard the liquid</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Layer up the warmed tortillas with the pork and refried beans

Garnish the assembled tacos with the zesty apple slaw and quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
