<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the ground allspice, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>black pepper and a very large pinch of salt to a plate

Mix all the spices together – this is your allspice seasoning</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chicken thighs to the allspice seasoning and turn them until they're fully coated in all the spices

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken (skin-side down) and cook for 7-8 min, until the skin is crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, de-seed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Deseed the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the browned chicken to a baking tray and set aside

Return the pan with the remaining oil to a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and pepper strips and cook for 3-4 min or until softened but not coloured</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and chicken stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the onion and pepper have softened, add most of the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse the kidney beans

Add the basmati rice and the drained kidney beans to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the coconut stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-15 min or until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, put the browned chicken in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fiery allspice chicken

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Drain and finely chop the pineapple

Combine the chopped pineapple, half the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!) and the reserved chopped red chilli in a bowl – this is your pineapple salsa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, finely slice the fiery allspice chicken

Serve the sliced fiery allspice chicken over the coconut rice

Spoon over the pineapple salsa and garnish with the remaining chopped spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
