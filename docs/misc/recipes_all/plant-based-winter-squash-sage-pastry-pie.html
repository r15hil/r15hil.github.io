Add the pastry to the tray[s] and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then crimp the borders with a fork and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until puffed up and golden – these are your pie lids</p><br><br>

Scrunch the foil around the greens to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until the greens are tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pie lids over the winter squash & sage filling with the spring greens to the side
