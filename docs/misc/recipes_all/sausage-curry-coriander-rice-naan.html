<h4>Step 2</h4>

Once hot, add the sausage meat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon as you go

Cook for 5 min or until the sausage meat has browned, then transfer to a bowl and reserve the pan

Tip: You'll finish cooking these in the sauce later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a small pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger and garlic with your ground cumin and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Stir and cook for 20 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the halved cherry tomatoes, tomato paste, chicken stock mix, browned sausage meat and a pinch of sugar

Add your spinach and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good mix up then cook, covered, for 5-6 min or until the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, add your curry powder and cook for a further 1-2 min or until thickened – this is your sausage curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Tip: For a little extra indulgence, butter the hot naan once it's out of the toaster

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the chopped coriander through the basmati rice just before serving – this is your coriander rice

Serve the sausage curry with the coriander rice and warmed naan to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
