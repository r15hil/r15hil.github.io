<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil half a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then slice on a diagonal

Slice your leek[s] in half lengthways, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves and chop into chunks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes, chopped carrots and chopped leek to a baking tray (or two!)

Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil, your dried sage and season with salt and pepper and give it a good mix up

Add the chicken thighs skin side up with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt on the skin

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 25 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<p>Add your cornflour and Marmite to a bowl with your chicken stock mix

Add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water  gradually and stir well (this is to ensure there's no lumps!) – this is your gravy mix

Wash your shredded spring greens then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once everything is cooked through, remove the tray[s] from the oven and transfer the chicken thighs to one side of the tray[s]

Add the shredded spring greens and mix with the vegetables

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 3 min or until the greens are wilted – this is your oven-baked chicken roast

Tip: Keep an eye on the spring greens, as they can burn quickly!</p><br><br>

Pour the gravy all over and enjoy!</p><br><br>
