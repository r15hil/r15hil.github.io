<h4>Step 6</h4>

Remove the pan from the heat, add the chopped parsley and dill, then set aside for serving (save the pan!) – this is your batata harra</p><br><br>

<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the coated halloumi and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until golden – this is your baharat halloumi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Serve the baharat halloumi with the batata harra, green beans and a dollop of natural yoghurt to the side

Sprinkle the natural yoghurt with some sumac and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
