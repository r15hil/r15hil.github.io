<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Pre-heat oven to 220C / 200C (Fan) / gas 7. Add your chicken breast portion to a baking tray. Drizzle with oil. Cook for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat)

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Top, tail then chop your courgette[s] into small batons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and courgette batons with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans

Once the vegetables have softened, add the drained black beans to the pan with your ground smoked paprika, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> cold water and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your enchilada filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide the enchilada filling between your tortillas (make sure the filling only covers half of each tortilla!)

Roll the loaded tortillas tightly to form a cigar shape – these are your vegetable enchiladas

Dice your tomato[es] very finely and add to a small bowl, then add the juice of your lime[s] – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the vegetable enchiladas to an oven-proof dish, with the seams facing down

Grate your cheddar cheese over the top

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until the cheese is golden and melted – these are your vegetable enchiladas

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to use 2 dishes!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and chop roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once done, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice

Serve the vegetable enchiladas with the chopped lettuce to the side

Dollop your soured cream over the top and garnish with the chopped coriander and tomato salsa

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
