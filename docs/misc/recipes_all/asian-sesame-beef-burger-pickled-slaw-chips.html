<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your beef mince, chopped ginger, sliced spring onion, soy sauce and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a grind of pepper

Using clean hands, give everything a very good mix up until fully combined – this is your burger mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Divide the burger mixture and shape into 1 patty per person

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds evenly over the burger patty[ies] – this is your sesame beef patty[ies]

Lightly oil a baking tray with vegetable oil and add the sesame beef patty[ies], then put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine half of your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), with your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar and salt in a bowl – this is your pickling liquid

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s], then peel lengths off your cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Add the grated carrot and cucumber ribbons to the bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat, and once hot, add the brioche halves cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You might need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo and remaining sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl – this is your sriracha mayo

Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Drain the quick-pickled slaw of any excess pickling liquid and discard the liquid</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the toasted brioche base with some of the sriracha mayo, then top with a sesame beef patty, some quick-pickled slaw, another dollop of sriracha mayo and the toasted brioche lid – this is your sesame beef burger

Serve the chips and any remaining quick-pickled slaw to the side

Sprinkle the chopped coriander over the quick-pickled slaw

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
