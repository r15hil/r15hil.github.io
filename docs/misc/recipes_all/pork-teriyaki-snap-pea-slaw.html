<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger


Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!


Roll the&nbsp;zested lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>&nbsp;with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half</p><br><br>
