<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into fries, then add to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil, a pinch of salt and the smoked paprika and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the fries are cooking, add the ground cumin, dried oregano, chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a plate

Gently stir it all together – this is your spice mix

Add the chicken breast portions to the plate and turn several times until fully coated in the spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the spiced chicken breast portions and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, dissolve the tomato paste in 200ml<span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Grate the cheddar flavour block

Combine the mayo and white wine vinegar in a small bowl and set aside for later – this is your zingy mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the tomato stock and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Flip the chicken occasionally to keep it moist!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash the gem lettuce, remove 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> outer leaves and shred the inner core

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Cut the ciabattas in half and add them to a tray, cut-side up

Put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and slightly crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan, season with a pinch of salt and mix it all up until fully coated in the sauce

Return the pan to a medium heat, top the shredded chicken with the grated cheddar flavour block and cook, covered, for 1 min further or until melted – this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed ciabattas with the lettuce leaves, Mexican-style pulled chicken and zingy mayo – this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken burger

Serve the Mexican-style pulled chicken burger with the paprika fries, shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes to the side

Drizzle any remaining zingy mayo over the lettuce and tomatoes

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
