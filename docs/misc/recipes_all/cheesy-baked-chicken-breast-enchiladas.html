<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until the chicken is starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has started to brown, reduce the heat to medium-high, add the sliced red onion and cook for 4-5 min or until everything is beginning to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 180ml <span class="text-purple">[270ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [360ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your ground cumin, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tomato stock and drained black beans to the pan and cook for 4-5 min until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and a thick sauce remains – this is your enchilada filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide 3/4 of the enchilada filling (save some for later!) between your tortillas, covering only half of each tortilla

Roll up your tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Place the enchiladas in an oven-proof dish, with the seam side down

Top with the remaining enchilada filling and grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until the cheese is golden and melted – these are your cheesy baked chicken breast enchiladas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the enchiladas are in the oven, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Strip your parsley leaves from their stalks and discard the stalks

Combine the remaining ground smoked paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/1 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl

Add your mayo and mix to combine – this is your smoky mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy baked chicken breast enchiladas and garnish with the sliced spring onion and parsley leaves

Drizzle over the smoky mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
