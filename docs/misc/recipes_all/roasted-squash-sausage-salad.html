<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, remove from the heat and leave to steam-dry, uncovered, until serving</p><br><br>

Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks (reserve some leaves for garnish)

Combine the onion marmalade, cider vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your onion marmalade dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
