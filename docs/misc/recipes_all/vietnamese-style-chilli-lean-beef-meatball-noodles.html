<h4>Step 4</h4>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until nicely browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
