<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and keep covered until serving

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and cut your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken thigh and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your soy chicken

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the carrot discs with the soy chicken to the pan and cook for an initial 5-6 min or until the chicken has browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chopped pepper and garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper has slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your honey, red chilli relish, toasted sesame oil, remaining soy sauce, rice vinegar and half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a bowl – this is your sesame chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once slightly softened, add your sugar snap peas and sesame chilli sauce and cook for a further 3 min or until your chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your garlic chilli chicken & sesame veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked rice and top with the garlic chilli chicken & sesame veg

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
