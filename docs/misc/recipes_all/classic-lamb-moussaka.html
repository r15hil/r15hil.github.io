<p><strong>Description:</strong> All the ingredients in our lamb moussaka are true to the classic. The lamb is spiced and gently cooked with onions, warm cinnamon and oregano. It’s layered up with aubergine, potato and tomato sauce. We’ve topped it off with yoghurt instead of béchamel which gives a light but creamy texture and less kitchen work!</p>

Put the dish in the oven for 15 min or until it's bubbling and golden - this is your moussaka&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Leave the moussaka to cool slightly before eating! It will improve the flavour and stop you burning your mouth!
