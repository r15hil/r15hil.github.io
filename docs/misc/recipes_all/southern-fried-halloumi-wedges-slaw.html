<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate

Crack your egg[s] into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork

Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with your dried oregano, ground smoked paprika and a very generous pinch of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – these are your seasoned panko breadcrumbs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Coat the halloumi slices in the flour, tap off the excess, then dip them into the beaten egg and press them into the seasoned panko breadcrumbs firmly to coat everything evenly

Tip: Make sure the halloumi slices are fully coated in the breadcrumbs on all sides!

Put in the fridge until later to firm up – these are your breaded halloumi slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Add the grated carrot to a bowl with your shredded red cabbage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your cider vinegar and mayo to the bowl with a generous grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your slaw

Combine your chilli relish with 10ml <span class="text-purple">[15ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20ml] </span>water – this is your chilli dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the breaded halloumi slices and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and crispy

Transfer onto kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil – this is your Southern fried halloumi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Southern fried halloumi with the wedges, slaw and chilli dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
