<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down (reserve the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half

Combine the juice of the orange<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 50ml <span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> cold water

Add the ground paprika and cornflour to the bowl and whisk everything together – this is your Filipino-style tocino sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once hot, add the Filipino-style tocino sauce to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain the king prawns

Once the sauce is beginning to thicken, add the drained king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a syrup-like consistency – these are your Filipino-style sticky king prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until softened and beginning to colour

Once softened, add the cooled rice and cook for 2-3 min – this is your garlic fried rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Filipino-style sticky king prawns with the garlic fried rice, chopped cucumber and diced tomato to the side

Spoon any remaining Filipino-style tocino sauce from the pan over the top of the prawns

Top the rice with the fried egg

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
