<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 2-3 min, then add your blanched peas to the pot and cook for 1 min further or until the tortelloni is cooked with a slight bite and the peas are refreshed

Once done, drain the cooked tomato & mozzarella tortelloni and refreshed peas, reserve the pot and a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the peeled garlic, pistachio nuts, the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, remaining basil (including the stalks), and remaining mint leaves to a food processor

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add the drained tomato & mozzarella tortelloni and peas

Add the pistachio pesto and stir gently until the pasta is coated in the pesto and everything is warmed through – this is your pistachio pesto with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pistachio pesto with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni with the reserved grated Italian hard cheese on top and a lemon wedge to the side

Garnish with the reserved mint and basil leaves, a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
