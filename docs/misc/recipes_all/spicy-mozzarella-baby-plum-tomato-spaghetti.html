<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle and preheat the grill to high

Chop half your cherry tomatoes in half

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and remaining whole cherry tomatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray under the grill until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and roughly slice (don't chop) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 4 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[6 tbsp]</span> [8 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced garlic to the pan with a very generous pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs

Remove the pan from the heat, and add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> of the reserved starchy pasta water

Tip: Be careful when adding the water to the pan, it may splash!

Return the pan to the heat, sprinkle in your vegetable stock mix and tear your parsley into the pan and stir it all together</p><br><br>

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy spaghetti topped with the grilled cherry tomatoes and the torn mozzarella – this is your spicy mozzarella & cherry tomato spaghetti
