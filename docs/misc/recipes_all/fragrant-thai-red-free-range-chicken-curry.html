<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water

Add your fish sauce and a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock and your mangetout and cook for 8-10 min or until the mangetout have softened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Thai red free range chicken curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai red free range chicken curry over the cooked rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with your crispy onions
