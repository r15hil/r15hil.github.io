<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pasta has been cooking for 8 min, add the sliced mangetout along with your blanched peas and cook for 2-3 min further or until the farfalle is cooked with a slight bite and the mangetouts are tender

Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Crumble your Greek cheese into rough bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Add the vegetable stock, soft cheese and a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to thicken – this is your creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad and tomato wedges to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and mix everything together – this is your leafy tomato salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the cooked farfalle, peas & mangetout through the creamy sauce

Add the crumbled Greek cheese, half the chopped mint and half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for later!) and give it a good mix up – this is your creamy pea & mangetout farfalle

Tip: If the sauce is looking a little dry add a splash of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy pea & mangetout farfalle with the leafy tomato salad to the side

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with the remaining chopped mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
