<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium heat

Crush your cashew nuts in their bag with a rolling pin, then once hot, add them to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden (watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!)

Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing with the side of a knife</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and sliced onion with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until the chicken is starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is browning, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, fish sauce and a pinch of sugar in 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [290ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once starting to brown, add your ground coriander, crushed cardamom pod[s] and red Thai curry paste to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the chicken is coated in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock, chopped sweet potato and your lime leaf[ves] to the pan and cook, covered, for 8-10 min until the sweet potato is almost fork-tender

Once fork-tender, add the halved green beans with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min further or until the beans are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your massaman-style chicken breast curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Discard the cardamom pod[s] and lime leaf[ves] from the curry

Serve the massaman-style chicken breast curry with the cooked rice to the side

Garnish with the toasted cashews

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
