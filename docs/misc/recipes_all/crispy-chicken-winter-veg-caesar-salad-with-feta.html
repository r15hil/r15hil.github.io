<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them on both sides with half your dried sage and a generous pinch of salt, then add skin-side down and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your parsnip[s] in half lengthways, then into batons

Slice the crispy chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
