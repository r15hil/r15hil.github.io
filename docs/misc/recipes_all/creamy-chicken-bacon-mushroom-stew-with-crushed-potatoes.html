<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now lets get started...

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and bacon lardons with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your waxy potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim your green beans, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once browned, crumble your chestnut mushrooms into the pan with the chicken and bacon and cook for 4 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have softened, add your onion marmalade to the pan with your soft cheese, cornflour, chicken stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water

Give everything a good stir and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy chicken, bacon & mushroom stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, add a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper and roughly crush with a fork – these are your crushed potatoes

Roughly tear your parsley into the creamy chicken, bacon & mushroom stew and season with a generous grind of pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken, bacon & mushroom stew with the crushed potatoes and cooked green beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
