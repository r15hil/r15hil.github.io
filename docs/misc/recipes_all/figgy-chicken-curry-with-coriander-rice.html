<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 6

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span></p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side

Once coloured, transfer the chicken thighs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and put it in the oven for 10 min (reserve the pan for later!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is in the oven, add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered for an initial 10 min

Wash the spinach, then add and cook covered for a further 2-5 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat with a knob of butter

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt and cook for 5 min or until softened

Tip: This may seem like too much salt, but stick with it, the salt balances the sweet coconut and fig flavours</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Roughly chop the creamed coconut (if required!)

Combine the fig relish and chopped creamed coconut with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water and whisk to combine – this is your figgy coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the curry powder, chopped ginger, chopped garlic and a generous amount of black pepper to the softened onion (add a little more oil if it's looking a little dry) and cook for 30 secs

Add the figgy coconut stock and chicken thighs, increase the heat to medium-high and cook, covered until the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your figgy chicken curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Add a knob of butter to the cooked rice, season generously with salt and pepper and add most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish)

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spinach & coriander rice

Once the chicken is done, remove the pan from the heat and shred it apart in the pan, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the figgy chicken curry over the spinach & coriander rice and garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
