<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot and cover until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and peel your garlic

Add the chopped pepper and peeled garlic to a baking tray (or two) with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil (use tin foil to avoid mess!) and cook for 15-20 min or until softened and starting to brown – this is your roasted pepper & garlic

Once softened, remove from the oven and set aside to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your ground cumin and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) on a plate with your dried oregano, a generous pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper – this is your Cajun-style seasoning

Cut your hake fillet[s] in half lengthways and pat them dry with kitchen paper

Press the chopped hake into the Cajun-style seasoning firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your Cajun-style hake</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your shallot[s] and your tomato[es]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the diced tomato and diced shallot in a bowl with your rice vinegar, chopped mint leaves and chopped coriander

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – this is your salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the roasted pepper & garlic has cooled slightly, add the roasted garlic and half the roasted pepper (save the rest for later!) to a food processor with the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add your mayo and tomato paste with the remaining smoked paprika

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your Cajun-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop the remaining roasted pepper finely

Add the chopped pepper to the salsa and mix until fully combined – this is your roasted pepper salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the Cajun-style hake and cook for 3-4 min on each side (your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily)

Tip: Do not be tempted to turn the fish early, leave it to form a crispy crust!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Cajun-style hake with the brown rice and roasted pepper salsa to the side

Drizzle the Cajun-style sauce over the hake

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
