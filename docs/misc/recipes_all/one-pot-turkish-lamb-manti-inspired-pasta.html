<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add your lamb mince to the dish with a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 2 min, breaking the mince into large chunks with a wooden spoon, until very lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your natural yoghurt with your roasted garlic paste and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your onion wedges, chicken stock mix, tomato paste, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and ground paprika to the dish with your conchiglie and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Nestle the pasta into the water as much as you can, then stir everything together and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pasta is cooked through

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Tip: Give everything a stir halfway through for evenly cooked pasta!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pasta is cooked, remove the dish from the oven, season with a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your one-pot Turkish lamb manti-inspired pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your one-pot Turkish lamb manti-inspired pasta

Drizzle with the garlic yoghurt

Garnish with the chopped mint
