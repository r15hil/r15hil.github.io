<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips and add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the smoked paprika to a plate with a grind of black pepper

Add the chicken breast strips to the plate and turn them several times in the spices until they're nicely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and scrunch the edges of the foil up a little around it

Tip: This will help to keep the sauce around your chicken!

Drizzle the BBQ sauce all over and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

After 10 min, remove the chicken tray from the oven and sprinkle over the torn cheese flavour slices

Return the tray to the oven for 5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the cheeze has melted – this is your cheezy BBQ chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into wedges

Slice the cucumber into rounds

Wash the gem lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Once everything's almost ready, add the shredded gem lettuce, chopped tomato and cucumber rounds to the bowl of dressing and give everything a gentle mix</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheezy BBQ chicken with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
