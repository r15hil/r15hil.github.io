<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Top, tail and cut your courgette[s] into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Dice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped veg to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 10-12 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [75ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [100ml] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic and dried oregano and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the vegetable stock and chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8-9 min or until starting to thicken, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool – this is your tomato sauce

While the sauce is cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks (save a few whole leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour and unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Add the rolled pastry to the tray, then prick the inside of the pastry all over with a fork (this will stop you from getting a soggy bottom!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Spread the tomato sauce over the pastry, leaving a 2cm border

Top with the roasted veg, then fold the pastry border over the edge of the filling

Tip: Start from one corner and work around in one direction, overlapping the pastry each time

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the pastry is cooked through and puffed up – this is your ratatouille galette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the galette is cooking, wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your red wine vinegar to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Add the salad and chopped basil to the bowl and toss – this is your herby salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the ratatouille galette in half and tear over the reserved basil leaves

Serve the halved ratatouille galette with the herby salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
