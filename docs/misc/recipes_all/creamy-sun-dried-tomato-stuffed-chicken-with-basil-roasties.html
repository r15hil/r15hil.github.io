<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with your dried basil, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your basil roasties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel your garlic

Combine your sun-dried tomatoes and the peeled garlic in a food processor with your soft cheese, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato filling

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Chop the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic finely and mix with the soft cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Use a sharp knife to cut a deep cross along the top of the chicken breast portions (be careful not to cut all the way through!) to make a pocket

Fill the pockets with the creamy sun-dried tomato filling and press it down with the back of a spoon</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your panko breadcrumbs to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your crumb

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil to a separate plate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Coat the stuffed chicken breasts in the oil, then press them into the crumb firmly to evenly coat all over – this is your breaded chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the breaded chicken, filling-side up, to a baking paper-lined baking tray and drizzle over a little olive oil

Put the tray in oven for 20-22 min or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your creamy sun-dried tomato stuffed chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your tomatoes roughly

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Combine the shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and your red wine vinegar – this is your lettuce & tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy sun-dried tomato stuffed chicken with the basil roasties and lettuce & tomato salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
