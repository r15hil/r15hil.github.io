<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle and chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Add your basmati rice and chopped creamed coconut to a pot with 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[600ml] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger

Strip your thyme leaves and chop them finely, discarding the stalks

Peel and dice your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain your pineapple, reserving the pineapple juice for later

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a small knob of butter and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tsp] </span>sugar over a high heat and cook for 30 secs or until starting to melt

Add the pineapple rings to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further, turning once until charred and caramelised, then transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool – this is your caramelised pineapple</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Carefully wipe the pan clean and return to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil once hot, add your lean pork mince (remove paper if required!) and chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the pork is beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once the mince is starting to brown, add the chopped garlic, grated ginger, ground paprika, ground allspice, chopped thyme and half of the diced shallot (save the rest for later!) and cook for 2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 50ml<span class="text-purple"> [65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[75ml] </span>boiled water to the pan with your soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>pineapple juice (you'll use the rest later!)

Cook, covered, for a further 5 min or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Caribbean-style lean pork</p><br><br>

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the caramelised pineapple has cooled, chop it finely and return it to the bowl with the remaining pineapple juice

Add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with the remaining shallot and half of the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your pineapple salsa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the Caribbean-style lean pork

Serve the Caribbean-style lean pork with the coconut rice and pineapple salsa to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
