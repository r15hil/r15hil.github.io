<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature and boil a kettle

Grate the potatoes (skins on), then add to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can

Add the grated potato to a bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a drizzle of vegetable oil to a cold, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), then add 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> piles of grated potato to the pan and firmly shape them into potato cakes – these are your potato röstis

Heat the pan over a medium-high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until golden, then flip the rösti carefully with a spatula and cook for 4-5 min further or until golden brown

Tip: Don't move the rösti around the pan too much so they stay together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop the parsnip<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped parsnip to a pot of boiled water over a high heat and cook for 15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain the cooked parsnip and add it to a food processor with the clotted cream and 75ml<span class="text-danger"> [125ml]</span> milk

Season with a generous pinch of salt and blitz until smooth – this is your parsnip purée</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the röstis are golden, transfer them to a baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until golden and cooked through

Dissolve the soy sauce and redcurrant jelly in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your redcurrant stock

Pat the sirloin steaks dry with kitchen paper, drizzle them with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat and once very hot, add the seasoned steaks

For rare, cook for 2-3 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 3-4 min on each side

For medium, cook for 4-5 min on each side

Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a plate to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the steaks are resting, reduce the heat to medium and add the redcurrant stock to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until thickened so it coats the back of a wooden spoon

Add a small knob of butter and give it a good mix up until melted – this is your redcurrant jus

Return the parsnip purée to a pot over a low heat and cook for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add it to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to wilt – this is your garlic spinach</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested sirloin steaks finely on a clean board and pour any resting juices into the redcurrant jus

Serve the sliced steak next to the parsnip purée (smear it with the back of a spoon for fancy presentation) with the potato rösti and garlic spinach to the side

Spoon over the redcurrant jus

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
