<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger, then peel and grate your garlic

Zest half your lime[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking)

Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a bowl with the chopped mint, half of the chopped coriander and half of the grated ginger and garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Add the lime zest, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl

Give everything a good mix up, then shape into 2 long sausages per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, preheat the grill to medium-high

Top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into thin discs

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Push a skewer through each of the sausages and transfer them to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a little vegetable oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min, turning once halfway through, or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Vietnamese-style pork skewers

Combine the juice of half your lime[s] in a bowl with your chilli relish and half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your sweet chilli dip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced carrot and pepper strips and cook for 4-5 min or until slightly charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once charred, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your red Thai curry paste, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour, the remaining grated garlic and ginger, remaining lime juice and remaining soy sauce and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, drain then add your king prawns, mangetout and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[140ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[180ml]</span> boiled water

Cook for 4-5 min further or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your fragrant king prawn stir-fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir the remaining chopped coriander into the fragrant king prawn stir-fry

Serve the fragrant king prawn stir-fry with the basmati rice, Vietnamese-style pork skewers and sweet chilli dip to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
