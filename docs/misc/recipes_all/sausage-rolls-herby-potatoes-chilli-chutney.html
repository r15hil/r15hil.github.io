<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into rectangles for per person.

Add the pastry rectangles to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) with your panko breadcrumbs and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your sausage mixture

Divide the sausage mixture into 1 per person and press each into a sausage shape and lay in the middle of each pastry rectangle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the mixture and crimp the sealed edges with a fork – these are your sausage rolls

Cut each sausage roll into 5, brush the tops of the pastry with a little cold water and sprinkle over your nigella seeds

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 20 min or until golden and puffed up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the sausage rolls are cooking, chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and set aside to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Dice your tomato[es]

Heat a pot over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Once the onion has softened, add the diced tomato with your tomato paste, half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and 50ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [75ml]</span> [100ml] </span>boiled water, then cook for 6-8 min further or until thickened and sticky – this is your chunky tomato & chilli chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your chives finely, then combine them with your Dijon mustard, remaining cider vinegar and 1.5 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[2 1/4 tbsp] </span>[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your herby dressing

Slice your apple[s] finely, discard the core

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Gently mix the sliced apple and salad together with a drizzle of olive oil in a separate bowl – this is your apple salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Toss the drained potatoes in the herby dressing – these are your herby potatoes

Serve the sausage rolls with the chunky tomato & chilli chutney, apple salad and herby potatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
