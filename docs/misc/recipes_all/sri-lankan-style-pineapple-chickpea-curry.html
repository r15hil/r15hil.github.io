<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Trim, then chop your green beans in half

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Discard the outer green pod[s] and add the cardamom seeds to a pestle & mortar with your yellow mustard seeds and a pinch of salt and roughly bash until you end up with a coarse powder – this is your spice mix

Once hot, add your ginger & garlic paste and chopped green beans with your ground turmeric, curry powder and spice mix and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix and gluten free soy sauce with your tomato paste and 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Meanwhile, drain and rinse your chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium high and add the drained chickpeas

Remove your pineapple from the can (save the juice!) and chop roughly into bite-sized pieces

Add the reserved pineapple juice to the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pineapple and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your Sri Lankan-style pineapple & chickpea curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the curry is cooking, squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Sri Lankan-style pineapple & chickpea curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with your flaked almonds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
