<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1

Add 125g <span class="text-danger">[all]</span> of your pizza base mix to a large bowl

Combine your egg[s] with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[400ml]</span> milk and 50ml<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [75ml]</span>[100ml]</span> cold water in a measuring jug

Whisk the liquid into the flour a little at a time until you end up with a smooth batter (adding the liquid gradually helps prevent a lumpy batter!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once smooth, pour the batter into a measuring jug and set aside to rest

Tip: Leaving it to rest allows any air bubbles to escape from the mixture!

Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"><span class="text-danger"> [3 tbsp]</span> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your salad dressing

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice the chestnut mushrooms finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Strip the thyme leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grate the cheddar cheese

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to brown

Add the chopped garlic and thyme and cook for 2 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Stir in the washed spinach and cook for 2 min or until wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the crème fraîche – this is your mushroom mix

Set the mushroom mix aside and reserve the pan

Wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper, then return to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once hot, pour 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/8]</span> of the batter (approximately 100ml) into the pan

Lift the pan and tilt it in a circular motion so that the mixture spreads evenly across the whole of the base

Once evenly spread, cook for 2 min or until the pancake is set

Once set, use a spatula to carefully flip the pancake over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once flipped, add 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/8]</span> of the mushroom mix in a semi-circle to one side of the pancake and top with 1/4 <span class="text-danger">[1/8]</span> of the grated cheddar

Fold the empty half of the pancake over the filling and cook for 1 min further or until the cheese has melted

Once you've finished each pancake, add it to a baking tray, cover with tin foil and put in the oven to keep warm until serving

Repeat this process until you have 4<span class="text-danger"> [8]</span> savoury pancakes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash the baby leaf salad, pat dry with kitchen paper and serve to the side of the savoury pancakes

Add the chopped tomatoes to the salad and drizzle over the salad dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
