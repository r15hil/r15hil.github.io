<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Cut your orange[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish (don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add half the sliced onion (you'll use the rest later!), crushed garlic, tomato wedges and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the onion is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion has begun to soften, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), cornflour and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chicken stock mix, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water, the juice of half your orange[s] and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your carnitas sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top the carnitas sauce with your duck leg[s] (along with the jelly and fat!), skin-side up, and put the dish in the oven, uncovered for 30 min

After 30 min, remove the dish from the oven, and shred the duck meat off the bone, then discard the bone

Mix it all together – this is your duck carnitas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the duck is cooking, add the remaining sliced onion to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the radish slices, most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) and the juice of the remaining orange to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and mix everything together – this is your radish salsa

When the duck is almost ready, add your tortillas to a baking tray (or two!) and put them in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your tacos, divide the duck carnitas, radish salsa and quick-pickled red onion evenly between the warmed tortillas

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
