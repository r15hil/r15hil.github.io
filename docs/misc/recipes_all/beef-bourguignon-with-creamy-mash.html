<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Season your diced beef with a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Once hot, add the coated diced beef to the dish and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, then remove from the dish and set aside, reserve the dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the beef is browning, peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the dish to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the chopped shallot, chopped carrot and crushed garlic

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until browned

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix, red wine paste and tomato paste in 475ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red wine stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have browned, return the browned beef to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the red wine stock, bay leaf[ves] and dried thyme and bring to the boil over a high heat

<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a large knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and mash until smooth – this is your creamy mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beef bourguignon over the creamy mash and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Discard your bay leaf[ves]

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
