<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water, then add it to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml [500ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender, then remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, combine the ground allspice in a large mixing bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> each of salt and pepper, then add the chicken breast portions and coat thoroughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to cool slightly</p><br><br>

Leave them to cool on the tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Strip the mint leaves and dill leaves from their stalks and chop finely, discard the stalks

Crumble the Greek cheese, then chop the cooled almonds coarsely

Drain the soaked cranberries

Finely slice the cooked chicken breast portions

Wash the lambs lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the drained cranberries, chopped almonds, chopped mint and dill, crumbled Greek cheese and lambs lettuce to the quinoa with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and the white wine vinegar and mix gently to combine – this is your jewelled quinoa
