<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato base evenly over your pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with your pepperoni, pepper strips and torn mozzarella

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your pepperoni pizza</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl – this is your balsamic dressing

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to the dressing and toss – this is your balsamic salad

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Set aside some of the plain salad for serving!</span></p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pepperoni pizza with the hot honey drizzled all over (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Serve with the balsamic salad to the side

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the hot honey and serve the reserved pepper strips and plain salad to the side!</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
