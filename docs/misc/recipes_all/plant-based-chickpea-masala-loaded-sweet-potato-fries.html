<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil half a kettle

Cut your sweet potato[es] (skin on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the fries are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the fries are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add half the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, dice your tomato[es]<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Drain and rinse your chickpeas

Combine your vegetable stock mix and chopped tomatoes with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste, garam masala and curry powder to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained chickpeas and tomato stock and cook for 8-10 min or until the chickpeas are tender and the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grind the chopped herbs in a pestle & mortar with a small pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste

Add your white wine vinegar, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil to the paste and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the sliced cucumber, diced tomato and remaining diced onion in a bowl with the coriander chutney and give everything a good mix up – this is your kachumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the curry sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and stir through half your cultured coconut (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your chickpea masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sweet potato fries topped with the chickpea masala and kachumber salad

Drizzle the remaining cultured coconut over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
