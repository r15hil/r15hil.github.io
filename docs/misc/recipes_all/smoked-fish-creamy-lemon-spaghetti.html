<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and boil a kettle

Once the pan is hot, add your roasted garlic paste, blanched peas and smoked basa fillet[s] with a generous pinch of pepper and cook, covered, for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst your fish is cooking, add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain and keep to one side, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drizzle some olive oil through the drained spaghetti and give it a good mix up (this stops the pasta from sticking together!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, break it apart into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon, then add your soft cheese and the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your smoked basa & creamy lemon spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water if the pasta is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa & creamy lemon spaghetti

Garnish with a lemon wedge and season with a grind of black pepper
