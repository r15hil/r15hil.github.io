<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, the boil a kettle

Add the carrot batons, onion wedges and cumin seeds to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-18 min or until the carrot is fork-tender – this is your cumin roasted carrot & onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, add your giant couscous to a pot of boiled water

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your lamb mince and half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) in a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide them and shape into 5 meatballs per person – these are your lamb meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the lamb meatballs and cook for 2 min on each side, then turn down the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6 min until your lamb is cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)– these are your browned lamb meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves into rough, bite-sized pieces

Combine your natural yoghurt and remaining chopped garlic in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your baharat and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pot from the heat, then add the drained couscous, cumin roasted carrot & onion and beef stock mix and stir it all together – this is your baharat spiced giant couscous</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the torn lettuce leaves in wide bowl topped with the baharat spiced giant couscous and browned lamb meatballs

Drizzle over the garlic yoghurt and top with the quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
