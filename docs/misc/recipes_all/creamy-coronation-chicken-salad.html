<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain, return to the pot and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh and your curry powder and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your cucumber finely

Wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the outer leaves into large bite-sized pieces and finely shred the inner core</p><br><br>

Chop the coriander stalks finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your natural yoghurt to a large bowl with your mango chutney, chopped coriander stalks, sultanas and the juice of half your lime[s]

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your yoghurt mix

Once cooked through, add the chicken to the yoghurt mix and stir it all together – this is your creamy coronation chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the crunchy salad between bowls

Top with the creamy coronation chicken and garnish with the coriander leaves, flaked almonds and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)
