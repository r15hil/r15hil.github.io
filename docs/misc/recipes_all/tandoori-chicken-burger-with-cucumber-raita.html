<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 1, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potato[es] (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crisp</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine 1/4 of your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) in a bowl with your curry powder, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt – this is your tandoori marinade</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your chicken breast portions to the tandoori marinade and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken

Tip: Unevenly sized thighs? Butterfly the thicker ones by cutting them in half like a burger bun (but don’t cut the whole way through!) then open them up</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the marinated chicken to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to char – this is your tandoori chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, grate the cucumber</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with the remaining natural yoghurt, mint sauce and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix it all together – this is your cucumber raita</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once the chicken is nearly cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and add the sliced brioche bun[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until the brioche is warmed through and toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread a dollop of cucumber raita on the toasted brioche base, then fill with the tandoori chicken, more cucumber raita and mango chutney – this is your tandoori chicken burger

Serve the tandoori chicken burger with the chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
