<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces

Chop half the tomatoes roughly (you'll use the rest later!)

Cut the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pot (with a lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and chopped potato to the pot with the chopped tomato and half the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 4-5 min or until the onion is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the creamed coconut (if required!)

Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Discard the outer green pods and add the cardamom seeds to the pot with the ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and ground turmeric

Give everything a good mix up and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix and 550ml<span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the potato is fork-tender

Once the potato is fork-tender, blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your Goan-stye curry soup</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the soup is cooking, chop the sultanas roughly

Dice the remaining tomato finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced tomato, remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little) and chopped sultanas to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the the tomato has completely broken down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once broken down, add the cider vinegar, a small pinch of salt and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, mix it all together and set aside to cool – this is your tomato chilli chutney

Once the Goan-style curry soup is blitzed, top with the haddock bites and a small pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!)

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, add the naans to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Goan-style haddock soup in bowls, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Top with most of the tomato chilli chutney, a little drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper

Serve the warmed naans to the side and any remaining tomato chilli chutney

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
