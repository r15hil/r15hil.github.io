<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

Peel and slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil

Once hot, add your diced beef and cook for 2-3 min or until lightly browned

Peel and finely chop (or grate) half your garlic and grate your chestnut mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the beef is lightly browned, add the sliced onion to dish with the chopped garlic, grated mushroom and a knob of butter and cook for 3 min further or until everything has slightly softened

Add your beef stock mix with 450ml<span class="text-purple"> [675ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[900ml]</span> boiled water, your tomato paste and Henderson's Relish

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 55 min – this is your beef & mushroom ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the ragù is in the oven, reboil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot with a knob of butter, a splash of milk and season with a pinch of salt

Mash until smooth and set aside to reheat later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the remaining garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Add your ciabatta[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until hot and crusty

Carefully slice the ciabatta before serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), sliced garlic and half the chopped parsley and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, drain then add your king prawns and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through – these are your garlic & chilli prawns

Serve the garlic & chilli prawns (and any of the tasty oil!) in a sharing dish with the sliced ciabatta to the side for dipping

Dig in and enjoy your starter of garlic & chilli prawns with ciabatta while the ragù is in the oven</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beef & mushroom ragù has been in the oven for 55 min, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt and a splash of cold water

Put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until tender, golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once ready, remove the beef & mushroom ragù from the oven and leave to stand for a couple of min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop)

Meanwhile, return the mash to a low heat with a splash of milk and half your grated Italian hard cheese

Gently reheat for 2 min or until the cheese has melted and the mash is warmed through – this is your cheesy mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy mash with the roasted Tenderstem broccoli to the side and spoon over the beef & mushroom ragù

Sprinkle over the remaining parsley and grated Italian hard cheese

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
