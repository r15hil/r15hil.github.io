<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the patties are cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a cheese flavour slice

Add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Drain the pickled shallots

Spread each brioche base with the mayo and each brioche lid with the chilli jam

Build your meat-free burger by topping the base with the pickled shallots, some lettuce leaves, a cheesy patty, some peanut butter and finish with the lid

Serve with the smoky wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
