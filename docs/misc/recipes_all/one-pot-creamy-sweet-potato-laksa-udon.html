<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat
