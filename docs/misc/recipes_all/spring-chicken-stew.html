<p><strong>Description:</strong> You may think stew is just for winter, but this creamy chicken dish has been updated for spring. Flavoured with smoky bacon, garlic, sweet sugar snap peas and creme fraiche - each element is in tune with spring. By coating the chicken here in cornflour before pan-frying it, you create a sauce that is perfectly thickened within the allotted time.</p>
