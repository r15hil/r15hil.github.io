<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Rinse your quinoa in a sieve under cold running water

Add the quinoa to a pot with a lid with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the quinoa is tender

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Roughly chop your sun-dried tomatoes

Slice your ciabatta[s] into 4 slices per person

Once the tomatoes have had 10 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the ciabatta slices to the other side of the tray[s] and top with the chopped sun-dried tomatoes, then crumble over your goats' cheese and sprinkle over your flaked almonds and dried oregano</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drizzle with a little of the honey mustard dressing (you'll use the rest later!) and return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the goats' cheese has started to melt – these are your goats' cheese & sun-dried tomato toasts

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the toasts and halved tomatoes are in the oven, peel your carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the carrot ribbons to a large bowl with the baby leaf salad and the cooked quinoa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the goats' cheese & sun-dried tomato toasts are done, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Add the roasted tomatoes and remaining honey mustard dressing to the bowl with the quinoa and gently toss everything together – this is your quinoa salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the quinoa salad topped with the warm goats' cheese & sun-dried tomato toasts

Sprinkle over your sultanas

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
