<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Once golden, transfer the toasted almonds to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and quarter your shallot[s]

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Chop your green chilli[es] in half lengthways and deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!), then wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add your curry powder and quartered shallot to a food processor with the crushed garlic, chopped tomato, creamed coconut and the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add most of your coriander (save some leaves for garnish!) with a small handful of spinach, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a drizzle of olive oil and blitz until smooth – this is your green tikka sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a small drizzle of olive oil and a little knob of butter

Once melted, add the green tikka sauce with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until very fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water with the vegetable stock mix

Chop your basa fillet[s] in half

Add the chopped basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-7 min further or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once the fish is cooked through, add the remaining spinach and a pinch of salt to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your green tikka masala basa curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the green tikka masala basa curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Top with the toasted almonds and remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
