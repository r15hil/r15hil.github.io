<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the meat-free sausage pieces and cook for 7-8 min or until browned all over, breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the sausages are cooking, stack your tortillas and slice them into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray[s] in the oven for 6-8 min or until lightly browned and crisp – these are your nachos

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the nachos are cooking, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and grate (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sausages have browned, add the diced shallot to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to soften

Add half your grated garlic (save the rest for later!) with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 30 secs further

Add your chopped tomatoes, 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> water and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has reduced – this is your spicy meat-free sausage sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your green chilli[es] finely

Combine the sliced green chilli and half your white wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) in a small bowl with a splash of water and a pinch of sugar

Mix well and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with your dried oregano, dried basil, remaining grated garlic, remaining white wine vinegar and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your garlic & herb mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy meat-free sausage sauce over the nachos - this is your plant-based spicy sausage pizza nachos 

Drizzle over the garlic & herb mayo and garnish with the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
