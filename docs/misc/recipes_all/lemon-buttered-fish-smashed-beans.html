<p><strong>Description:</strong> Zesty lemon-buttered basa is served over warm smashed beans and dill flecked potatoes. Here, we've used two types of beans: runner beans and butter beans. 'Smashed' simply means that instead of mashing until smooth, you'll lightly crush the potatoes which gives a more rustic texture and means less work for your arm. Smashing stuff!</p>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain the potatoes and runner beans and&nbsp;return them to the pot with the&nbsp;butter&nbsp;beans


Add the dill, a large knob of butter and season generously with salt and pepper


Smash the beans and potatoes briefly with a potato masher (smashing is a lighter version of mashing and ensures that a course texture is maintained)</p><br><br>
