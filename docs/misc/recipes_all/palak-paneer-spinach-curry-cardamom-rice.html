Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the palak paneer with the cardamom rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions and remaining chopped red chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
