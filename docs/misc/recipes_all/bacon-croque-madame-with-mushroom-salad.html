<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer the bacon to kitchen paper (reserve the pan)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Finely slice your white cup mushrooms

Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat (if the pan is looking a little dry add a drizzle of vegetable oil)

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 5 min or until browned

Once the mushrooms have browned remove them from the heat and set aside (reserve the pan)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, melt 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp] </span>butter in a pot over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Gradually whisk in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>cold milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 4-5 min or until a thick sauce remains – this is your béchamel sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and put in the toaster for 1-2 min or until starting to crisp

Grate your cheddar cheese

Once the béchamel sauce has thickened, add half the grated cheese (you'll use the rest later!) with a good grind of black pepper and stir it all together – this is your cheese sauce

Set the cheese sauce aside to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Spread butter over the toasted ciabatta halves and spread your Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan? Go easy!) over half the ciabatta halves

Add the mustardy slices to a baking tray and divide half the cheese sauce between them, add the crispy bacon, then top with the remaining buttered ciabatta halves

Pour the remaining cheese sauce over the top and sprinkle over the reserved grated cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven for 6-8 min further or until the cheese has melted – these are your bacon croque madames

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Combine the sliced shallot with your cider vinegar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil in a small bowl – this is your shallot dressing

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until cooked to your liking

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bacon croque madames topped with a fried egg

Serve the salad to the side topped with the mushrooms and drizzle the shallot dressing all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
