<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the tomato wedges, chopped garlic, chopped basil and most of the toasted almonds (save some for garnish!) to a food processor with 50ml <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt

Add the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon quarter<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and blitz until smooth – this is your Trapanese-style pesto

Tip: This sauce will season the whole dish, so taste it and add a pinch more salt if needed</p><br><br>

Season with a good grind of black pepper
