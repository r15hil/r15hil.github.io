<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a sprinkling of flour, then unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 piece per person

Transfer the pastry to a non-stick baking paper lined-tray (or two!) and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife, then crimp the borders with a fork

Sprinkle your nigella seeds over the pastry and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and cooked through – this is your pie lid[s]</p><br><br>

Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>
