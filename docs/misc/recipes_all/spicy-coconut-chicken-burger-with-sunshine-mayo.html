<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your sweet potato[es] and potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

Peel your garlic

Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in a bowl with the juice of half the lime[s] and the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your coconut marinade

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coconut marinated chicken and cook for 6 min on each side or until slightly charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy coconut chicken

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed brioche with a handful of salad, the spicy coconut chicken, a dollop of sunshine mayo and the quick-pickled chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), reserve the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled chilli

Serve the remaining salad with a drizzle of olive oil and the reserved pickling liquid and set the fries and any remaining sunshine mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
