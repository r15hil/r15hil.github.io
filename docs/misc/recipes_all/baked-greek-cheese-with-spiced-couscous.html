<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into bite-sized pieces

Transfer the chopped pepper to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min or until the pepper is beginning to char</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pepper is beginning to char, remove the tray from the oven and add your Greek cheese with a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Return the tray to the oven for 5-6 min further or until the Greek cheese has softened

Once softened, remove the tray from the oven and let cool slightly – this is your baked Greek cheese & roasted pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the Greek cheese is cooking, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can then roughly chop</p><br><br>
