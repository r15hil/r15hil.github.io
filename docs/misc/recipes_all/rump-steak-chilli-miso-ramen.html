<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature, then boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a large pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)

Boil for exactly 8 min for a perfect, mid-boiled egg, then fill a bowl of ice cold water (use the Gousto ice packs!) and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Trim, then slice your spring onions finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Chop any larger pak choi leaves in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and white miso paste and cook for 30 secs

Add 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1.4L]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up, then add your rice vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and simmer gently – this is your broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the broth simmers, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt

Once very hot, add the steak to the pan: for rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest, then add the medium egg noodles to the broth and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 4-5 min or until tender, then add the pak choi and cook for a further 1-2 min or until wilted

Once done, add any resting juices from the steak into the broth – this is your chilli miso ramen</p><br><br>

Slice the rested rump steak finely on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chilli miso ramen topped with grated carrot, sliced spring onion, sliced rump steak and egg halves

Garnish with your black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
