<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your 'Nduja, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and cook for 6-8 min or until crisp and golden – this is your crispy 'Nduja</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water (save the pot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Zest your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped parsley and lemon zest in a small bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your gremolata

Dissolve your chicken stock mix, soft cheese and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the creamy tomato stock to the pot and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to thicken – this is your creamy tomato sauce

Cut the zested lemon[s] in half, then a squeeze of lemon juice into the sauce (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained orecchiette to the creamy tomato sauce and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato sauce with fresh orecchiette with the salad to the side

Top the orecchiette with the crispy 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and gremolata

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil over the salad and serve with a lemon wedge on the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
