<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain your sweetcorn

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain the quick-pickled red onion and reserve the pickling liquid

Combine your mayo and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the pickling liquid in a small bowl and give everything a good mix – this is your zingy chipotle mayo

Once the potatoes and onion are cooked, add them to the salad mix with the charred sweetcorn and give everything a good mix up – this is your potato & sweetcorn salad

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the potato & sweetcorn salad in bowls and top with the garlic king prawns and quick-pickled red onion

Drizzle over the zingy chipotle mayo and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
