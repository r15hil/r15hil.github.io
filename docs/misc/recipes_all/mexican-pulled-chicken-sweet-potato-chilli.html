<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Pat the chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them with a pinch of salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs and cook for 3 min on each side or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and cut the sweet potato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> into bite-sized pieces

Deseed the green pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized pieces

Combine the tomato paste and soy sauce with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water — this is your tomato stock

Drain and rinse the black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the diced shallot, ground cumin, ground allspice, half of the smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped sweet potato, chopped pepper, tomato stock and drained black beans to the pan and cook, covered, for an initial 15-20 min or until the sweet potato is tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

After an initial 15-20 min, remove the lid and cook for a further 3-4 min, or until the sauce has started to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the chilli is cooking, add the basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the natural yoghurt and remaining smoked paprika in a small bowl — this is your spiced yoghurt

Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Return the pulled chicken to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Stir through 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> of the spiced yoghurt — this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken & sweet potato chilli</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style pulled chicken & sweet potato chilli with the basmati rice and spiced yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
