<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the chicken is starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Grate your cheddar cheese

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has started to brown, add the sliced onion and cook for 7-8 min or until everything's beginning to soften and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 180ml <span class="text-purple">[270ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[360ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your ground cumin, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and half your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the tomato stock and drained black beans to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until a thick sauce remains – this is your enchilada filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Divide 3/4 of the enchilada filling (save some for later!) between your tortillas, covering one half of each tortilla

Roll up the tortillas tightly – these are your enchiladas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Place the enchiladas in an oven-proof dish, with the seam side down

Top with the remaining enchilada filling and grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven for 10-12 min or until the cheese is golden and melted – these are your cheesy baked chicken thigh enchiladas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the enchiladas are in the oven, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and discard the stalks

Combine your remaining ground smoked paprika and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> boiled water in a small bowl

Add your mayo and mix to combine – this is your smoky mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy baked chicken thigh enchiladas and garnish with the sliced spring onion and coriander leaves

Drizzle over the smoky mayo

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
