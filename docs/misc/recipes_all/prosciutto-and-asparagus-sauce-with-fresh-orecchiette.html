<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your sliced prosciutto to a plate and put in the microwave for 4-5 min, then set aside until serving to dry and crisp up – this is your crispy prosciutto

Tip: Check your sliced prosciutto every 30 secs to prevent them from burning, as microwave temperatures vary!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the orecchiette, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus and discard, then chop into bite-sized pieces

Once hot, add the chopped asparagus to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Zest half your lemon[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter) and cut into wedges

Wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the sliced garlic to the pan with the softened asparagus and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

Add your soft cheese to a bowl with half your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and mix together

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[80ml]</span> milk and 50ml <span class="text-purple">[70ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[90ml]</span> starchy pasta water

Add a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and stir together until completely combined – this is your creamy sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the creamy sauce to the pan with the drained orecchiette

Add the lemon zest and the juice of half your lemon wedges (not sure about citrus? Try using less!)

Give everything a gentle mix up and cook for 1 min further until the pasta is coated in the sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Crumble the crispy prosciutto over the orecchiette and sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese – this is your prosciutto & creamy asparagus sauce with fresh orecchiette

Serve the salad to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge, a generous grind of black pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
