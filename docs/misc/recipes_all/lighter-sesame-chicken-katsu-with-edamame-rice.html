<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot, then rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water, add to the pot with the rice and keep covered until serving – this is your edamame brown rice</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Sprinkle over your black sesame seeds and season with a generous pinch of salt, then put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sesame chicken</p><br><br>
