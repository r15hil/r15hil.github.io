<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is lovely for a midweek supper and ideal for preparing ahead. Served with hot green vegetables and buttered new potatoes. Mary's foolproof tip: Brown the pork  on all sides, including the fatty edges. This seals the juices in and prevents the pork from drying out during baking.</p>
