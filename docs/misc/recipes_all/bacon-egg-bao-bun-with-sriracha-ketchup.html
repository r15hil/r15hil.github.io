<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer the crispy bacon to kitchen paper, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, pour in the egg mix and cook for 2-3 min or until the egg is fully cooked through

Transfer to a board and slice into 3 pieces per person – this is your egg filling</p><br><br>
