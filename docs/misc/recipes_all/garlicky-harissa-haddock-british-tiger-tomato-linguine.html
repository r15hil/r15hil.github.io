<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for an initial 7-8 min

Tip: This will finish cooking in your sauce later!

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving 50ml <span class="text-purple">[60ml] <span class="text-danger">[70ml]</span> </span>of starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Dissolve your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and vegetable stock mix in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[85ml]</span> boiled water with 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your harissa stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a small drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until the garlic has slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Once the garlic has slightly softened, add the haddock bites to the pan with the tomato wedges and a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until the fish begins to turn opaque</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once slightly opaque, add the drained linguine to the pan with a generous grind of black pepper, the harissa stock, reserved starchy pasta water and a knob of butter

Give everything a good mix up and increase the heat to high, then cook for 1-2 min further or until the sauce has slightly reduced and the fish is beginning to break up – this is your garlicky harissa haddock & tomato linguine

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the garlicky harissa haddock & tomato linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with a crack of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
