After an initial 25 min, remove the tray[s] of vegetables from the oven and crush the cooked tomato wedges with the back of a fork

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chicken and vegetables are cooking, chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

Once cooked, transfer the chicken Milanese to a clean board and leave to rest for a couple of min before slicing

Remove the vegetables from the oven and mix them all up until everything's coated in the tomatoey sauce – these are your tomatoey potatoes & green beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tomatoey potatoes & green beans with the chicken Milanese to the side

Sprinkle over the chopped basil and garnish with the lemon wedges

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
