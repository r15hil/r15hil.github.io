<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put them in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp and browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the onion marmalade, Dijon mustard, mayo and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl with a pinch of pepper – this is your sweet onion mayo

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Slice the brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves, cut-side down, to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until nicely browned

Once browned, transfer them to a plate and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, remove the meat-free sausage meat from the casings and add it to a bowl, discard the casings

Using clean hands, break it apart and give it a good mix up until fully combined

Divide the meat-free sausage meat into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and shape into patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the meat-free sausage patties, cover with a lid and cook for 4-6 min, turning midway through until the patties are browned

Tip: Press the patties down with a spatula to keep them nice and flat throughout cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the red wine vinegar, dried oregano, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a small bowl with a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper – this is your vinaigrette</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves into bite-sized pieces, then add them to the bowl with the vinaigrette and give everything a good mix up – this is your lettuce salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your burger, top each toasted brioche base with 2 meat-free sausage patties, a spoonful of sweet onion mayo and finish with the toasted brioche lid

Serve the lettuce salad and wedges to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
