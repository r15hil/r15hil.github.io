<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, combine your gochujang paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), rice vinegar, tomato ketchup, honey and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water in a bowl

Give everything a good mix up – this is your yang-nyum sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> yang-nyum sauce (you'll use the rest later!) with your mayo and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a separate bowl – this is your creamy Korean-style dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken breast to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and your soy sauce

Give everything a good mix up so the chicken is fully coated

Add your cornflour to a separate bowl

Add the chopped chicken to the bowl with the cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

Once crispy, transfer to kitchen paper and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, carefully pour away the oil

Tip: Store it in a glass jar and you can use this oil again for frying!

Return the pan to a medium heat and add the chopped garlic and remaining yang-nyum sauce and cook for 1-2 min or until thickened

Once thickened, add the crispy chicken with your toasted sesame seeds and give everything a good mix up – this is your Korean-style yang-nyum fried chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Combine the grated carrot and shredded lettuce – this is your salad

Serve the Korean-style yang-nyum fried chicken with the cooked rice and salad to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish the chicken with the sliced spring onion and drizzle the creamy Korean-style dressing over the salad and enjoy!</p><br><br>
