<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat, once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast strips into large bite-size pieces

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is golden, reduce the heat back to medium, then add your arborio rice and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs further

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20 min or until most of the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add the asparagus tips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until bright green and tender with a bite – these are your roasted asparagus tips

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped asparagus stalks to the pan and cook for 5 min further until the rice is cooked and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Add the juice of half your lemon[s] and the grated cheese and give everything a good mix up until fully combined

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your asparagus & chicken risotto

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the asparagus & chicken risotto topped with the roasted asparagus tips and a handful of salad

Drizzle with some olive oil and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
