<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Season your chicken breast portion[s] with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Reduce the heat to medium-high, add 80ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>boiled water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger, then top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into matchsticks

Dissolve your pho broth paste and chicken stock mix in 600ml <span class="text-purple">[800ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [1L]</span> boiled water – this is your pho stock

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your rice noodles to a bowl and cover them with boiled water

Set aside for 12-15 min or until softened

Once softened, drain the noodles and set aside

Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a clean board and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

While the onion is cooking, shred the chicken apart using two forks - this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Set the pulled chicken aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

Strip most of your mint leaves from their stems, leave some on the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the drained noodles to the pan with the pho stock, chopped ginger, fish sauce and pulled chicken and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 1-2 min or until the noodles are completely tender

Once tender, remove the pan from the heat and add the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lime[s] – this is your fragrant pho with shredded chicken

Cut the remaining lime[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant pho with shredded chicken topped with the chopped coriander, mint leaves and mint stems and the carrot matchsticks

Drizzle over your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
