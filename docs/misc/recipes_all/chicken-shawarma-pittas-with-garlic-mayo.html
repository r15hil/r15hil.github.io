<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Add the sliced red onion to a bowl, cover with boiled water and set aside

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your diced chicken thigh and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and ground coriander

Add a drizzle of olive oil with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, drain the sliced onion in a sieve and run under cold water until cooled

Return them to the bowl and add your white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir to combine and set aside for later – this is your quick-pickled pink onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and shred finely

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are done, push them to one side and add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the other side of the tray[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a final 2-3 min or until the pitta[s] is warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the warmed pitta in half and fill with the cooked chicken, quick-pickled onion salad and some of the garlic mayo – this is your chicken thigh shawarma pitta

Serve the chicken thigh shawarma pitta with the chips, remaining quick-pickled onion salad and garlic mayo to the side
