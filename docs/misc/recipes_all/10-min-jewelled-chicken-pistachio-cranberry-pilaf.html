<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous knob of butter over a high heat

Once melted, add the diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach to the pan along with your soy sauce and cook for 2-3 min further or until the spinach is starting to wilt and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 30 secs further or until the rice is completely coated in all the spices – this is your jewelled chicken & cranberry pilaf</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set the jewelled chicken & cranberry pilaf in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish with your pistachio nuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
