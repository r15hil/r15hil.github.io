<p><strong>Description:</strong> Rich, spicy and nutty, this speedy stir fry has it all. You’ll pan fry pork mince before adding pepper, red onion and green beans. Simmer the lot in a spicy peanut sauce before serving with fluffy rice and extra peanuts to garnish. High in protein. Protein contributes to a growth in muscle mass.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince to the pan (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until nicely browned, breaking it up into large chunks with a wooden spoon

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened and browned, add the peanut sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for a final 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened, the beans are tender with a bite and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy Thai-style peanutty pork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy Thai-style peanutty pork over the cooked rice

Top with the crushed peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
