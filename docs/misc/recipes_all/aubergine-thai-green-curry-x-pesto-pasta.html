<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the halved shallot and peeled garlic to a food processor with the chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), your basil and a pinch of salt

Add your creamed coconut, the juice of the lime[s], your vegetable stock mix, half your roasted peanuts and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil

Blitz until smooth – this is your Thai green curry pesto

Tip: Don't have a food processor? Finely chop the ingredients and grind in a pestle & mortar instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is tender, add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the Thai green curry pesto, halved tomatoes and a pinch of salt

Add a splash of the reserved pasta water and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated – this is your aubergine Thai green curry x pesto pasta</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the aubergine Thai green curry x pesto pasta in a bowl and garnish with the chopped roasted peanuts and your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
