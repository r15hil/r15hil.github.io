<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl

Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top

Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 5-6 min or until the squash cubes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the spinach & ricotta ravioli and shredded kale to a pot with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli and kale for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite and the kale has wilted

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the cooked butternut squash to a food processor with half the ricotta (you'll use the rest later), 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> reserved starchy pasta water and a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until you are left with a smooth sauce – this is your ricotta & butternut squash sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat, pour in the ricotta & butternut squash sauce and give everything a good stir</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spinach & ricotta ravioli & kale to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your ricotta & butternut squash sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Tip: Add an extra splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the ricotta & butternut squash sauce with spinach & ricotta ravioli

Top with the remaining ricotta and pumpkin seeds, then season with a generous grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
