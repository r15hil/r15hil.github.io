<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into fries and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix to combine, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp

Cut the pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Drizzle a separate baking tray (or two!) with vegetable oil (use tin foil to avoid mess!) then add your chicken breast portion[s] to one side of the tray[s]

Tip: Unevenly sized chicken breast? Cut in half like a burger bun (but don’t cut the whole way through!) then open up

Add the halved pepper to the other side of the tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Top the chicken evenly with your ‘Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your ‘Nduja-topped chicken

Meanwhile, wash your salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your shallot[s],<span class="text-danger"> </span>then add to a large bowl with your cider vinegar, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and Dijon mustard

Add most of the salad to the bowl (you'll use the rest later!), then season with a grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Cut 2 slices per person from your tomato[es] and set aside for later, then finely dice the rest

Add the sliced cucumber and diced tomato (keeping the sliced tomato aside for later!) to the salad bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato & cucumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the fries are done, remove them from the oven, push to one side and top with your grated Italian hard cheese

Cut your ciabatta[s] in half and add to the other side of the tray[s]

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 2-3 min until the cheese has melted and the ciabatta is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your mayo to a small bowl and season with a few grinds of black pepper – this is your black pepper mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fill the warmed ciabatta with a dollop of black pepper mayo, the roasted pepper, ‘Nduja-topped chicken, reserved salad and sliced tomato – this is your chicken, ‘Nduja & roasted pepper sandwich

Serve with the tomato & cucumber salad, cheesy fries and any remaining black pepper mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
