<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and transfer it to a plate

Spread the cooked rice out evenly on the plate and set aside to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add half your dried chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind together – this is your chilli salt

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, just mix the two together!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Trim your cucumber, then bash it several times with a rolling pin until broken

Tip: Bash the cucumber in its bag to avoid mess. By bruising the cucumber, the water is drawn out more easily!

Chop the smashed cucumber into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped smashed cucumber to a bowl with the chilli salt, toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, drain, then add your king prawns to the pan with the chopped ginger, garlic, spring onion and remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Cook for 2-3 min, then add the cooled rice and soy sauce and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the prawns are cooked through – this is your Indonesian-style king prawn fried rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until cooked to your liking</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indonesian-style king prawn fried rice with the smashed cucumber to the side

Top the rice with a fried egg and drizzle the cucumber with any remaining dressing

Garnish with your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
