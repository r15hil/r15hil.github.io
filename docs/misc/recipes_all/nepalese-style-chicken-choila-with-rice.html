<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, carefully add your black mustard seeds and coriander seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant, then transfer to a heat proof bowl and set aside for later, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook on both sides for 3 min or until browned

Add the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray, reserve the pan and put under the grill for 8-10 min or until charred, caramelised and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your grilled chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chopped garlic & ginger, diced onion, chopped chilli and half the chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add your ground turmeric, chicken stock mix and toasted mustard & coriander seeds with 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[170ml]</span> cold water and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your choila sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut your lime[s] in half

Once cooked, transfer the grilled chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the shredded chicken, remaining chopped tomato, sliced spring onion and most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) to the pan with the choila sauce

Add the juice of half the lime[s], season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix – this is your Nepalese-style chicken thigh choila

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Nepalese-style chicken thigh choila on top of the cooked rice

Garnish with the remaining coriander and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
