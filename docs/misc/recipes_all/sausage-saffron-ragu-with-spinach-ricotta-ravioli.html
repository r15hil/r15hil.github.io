<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add the sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan with the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the spinach & ricotta ravioli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the ravioli for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the ravioli, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Combine the tomato paste and saffron with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>boiled water – this is your saffron stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat is starting to brown, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the Chinese rice wine and saffron stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce thickens slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add a knob of butter and half the cracked black pepper (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your sausage & saffron ragù

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained ravioli into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce, discard the bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage & saffron ragù ravioli with the rocket to the side

Top the pasta with the grated Italian hard cheese and the remaining cracked black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
