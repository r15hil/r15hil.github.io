<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped sweet potato to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the sweet potato has softened, add your ginger & garlic paste and curry powder to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml] </span>boiled water and cook, covered, for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the sweet potato is tender

Once tender, add your garden veg mix and give everything a good mix up – this is your samosa filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a baking tray with your nigella seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your nigella wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Spoon the samosa filling down the middle of each pastry rectangle and brush a little cold water around the edges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Fold your pastry over the filling and seal firmly together, then use a fork to crimp along the edge

Roll the sealed pastries, starting at one end, into a spiral

Transfer the pastry spirals to the lined baking tray[s] and put the tray[s] in the oven for 22-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your vegetable samosa pinwheels</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grind your chopped herbs in a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt until you're left with a smooth paste

Add half the cider vinegar, a pinch of sugar and a drizzle of olive oil to the paste and mix to combine – this is your chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your chutney with the natural yoghurt in a bowl – this is your mint & coriander chutney yoghurt

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the baby leaf salad to a large bowl with the remaining cider vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, spread the mango chutney over the vegetable samosa pinwheels

Serve the glazed vegetable samosa pinwheels with the nigella wedges, dressed salad and mint & coriander chutney yoghurt to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
