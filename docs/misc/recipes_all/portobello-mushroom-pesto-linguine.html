<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to a high heat, then boil a kettle


(For a more interesting texture) rip the portobello and chestnut&nbsp;mushrooms&nbsp;into bite-sized pieces onto a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil&nbsp;then season generously with salt and pepper&nbsp;


Put the tray directly under the grill and cook for 12-15 min or until they're nicely caramelised</p><br><br>
