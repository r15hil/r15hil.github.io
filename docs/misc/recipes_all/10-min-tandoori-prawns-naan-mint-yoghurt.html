<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Combine your curry powder, ground paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 1/4 of your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your tandoori marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain your king prawns, then add them to the tandoori marinade and give everything a good mix up until the prawns are fully coated

Set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the naan[s] are in the toaster, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your cucumber in half lengthways, then slice finely

Add the chopped tomatoes and sliced cucumber to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tomato & cucumber salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining natural yoghurt with your mint sauce – this is your mint yoghurt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the marinated tandoori prawns and any remaining tandoori marinade from the bowl to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until the prawns are cooked through – these are your tandoori king prawns

Note: Please make sure you cook your prawns thoroughly (until piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies

While the prawns are cooking, cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warmed naan with the tandoori king prawns, tomato & cucumber salad and mint yoghurt on top

Garnish with your nigella seeds and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
