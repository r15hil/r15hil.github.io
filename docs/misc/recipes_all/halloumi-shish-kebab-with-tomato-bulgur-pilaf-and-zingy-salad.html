<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut the halloumi into bite-size cubes, then add them to a bowl with the ground paprika, ground cumin and the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon

Season with pepper and give everything a good mix up, then set aside to marinate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> as finely as you can

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion and cook for 6 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Soak your skewers in cold water (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking!)

Dissolve the tomato paste in 400ml <span class="text-danger">[750ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the bulgur wheat and sultanas with a generous pinch of salt, then cook for 1 min or until coated in the oil

Add the tomato stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 15 min or until the water has absorbed and the bulgur is cooked – this is your tomato bulgur pilaf</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the bulgur wheat is cooking, preheat the grill to high

Thread the marinated halloumi cubes evenly onto 4<span class="text-danger"> [8] </span>soaked skewers, leaving a small gap between each piece – these are your halloumi shish kebabs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the halloumi shish kebabs to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min, turning once halfway, or until the halloumi is slightly charred

While the halloumi is cooking, add the natural yoghurt to a bowl with a small squeeze of juice from the remaining lemon (save the rest for later!) – this is your lemon yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the rest of the juice from the remaining lemon to a large bowl with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a crack of black pepper

Add the grated carrot, diced tomato and baby leaf salad and give everything a good mix up – this is your zingy salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Drizzle the lemon yoghurt over the halloumi shish kebabs and serve with the tomato bulgur pilaf and the zingy salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
