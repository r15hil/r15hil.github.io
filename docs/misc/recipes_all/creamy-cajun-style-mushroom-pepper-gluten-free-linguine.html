<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of salt, a pinch of sugar and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Brush the top side of the portobello mushrooms with a little vegetable oil (this helps the spices stick!)

Press the oiled side of the portobello mushrooms into the Cajun-style spice mix and save the rest of the spice mix for later – these are your Cajun-style spiced portobello mushrooms</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the Cajun-style spiced portobello mushrooms to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 18-20 min or until the mushrooms are cooked through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Deseed the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, chopped garlic, pepper strips and the remaining Cajun-style spice mix and cook for 8-10 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the gluten free linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of starchy pasta water

Reboil half a kettle

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix<span class="text-danger"> </span>and soft cheese in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the veg has softened, add the Chinese rice wine and cook for 30 secs or until evaporated

Add the creamy stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

Once thickened, add the drained linguine and give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy Cajun-style pepper gluten free linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the spiced portobello mushrooms finely

Serve the sliced spiced portobello mushrooms over the creamy Cajun-style pepper gluten free linguine

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
