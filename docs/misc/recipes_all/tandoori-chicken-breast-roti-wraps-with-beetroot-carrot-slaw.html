<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Combine your curry powder, half of your natural yoghurt, half of your ginger paste (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your tandoori marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is marinating, preheat the grill to high

Grate your beetroot then add to a sieve over the sink and squeeze out any excess water

Top, tail and grate your carrot[s]

Peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the marinated chicken breast to a tin foil-lined baking tray and put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to char – this is your tandoori chicken breast</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is nearly cooked, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium-high heat

Sprinkle your roti with a little cold water

Once hot, add the roti to the pan and cook for 1-2 min on each side or until warmed through

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in batches or use a second pan!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, spread the mango yoghurt over the warmed roti then top with some beetroot & carrot slaw and tandoori chicken breast

Garnish with the remaining chopped mint

Serve the remaining beetroot & carrot slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
