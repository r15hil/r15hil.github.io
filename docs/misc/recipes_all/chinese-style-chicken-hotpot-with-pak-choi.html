<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s] into wedges, then top, tail and slice your carrot[s] into discs and slice your baby button mushrooms in half

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger, wash then slice your pak choi in half, lengthways and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges, carrot discs and halved mushrooms to the dish and cook for 3-4 min or until the vegetables begin to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add your drained rice to an oven-proof dish with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your sticky rice

Reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the vegetables have softened, add your diced chicken thigh to the dish with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until lightly browned

Dissolve your beef stock mix, soy sauce and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml] </span>boiled water – this is your stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add your ground coriander, star anise and half the grated ginger (you'll use the rest later) to the dish and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, pour in the stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and place in the oven for 15-20 min or until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Chinese-style chicken hotpot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and remaining grated ginger to a small heatproof bowl with a pinch of sugar

Heat a pot with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat for 1-2 min or until very hot

Once hot, carefully pour the heated oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your chilli oil

Tip: Be careful – the ginger will sizzle from the heat of the oil!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the halved pak choi, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly brown, then season with a pinch of salt

Once brown, add a splash of boiled water and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until soft, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Chinese-style chicken hotpot in a bowl (don't forget to remove the star anise!) with the sticky rice and pak choi to the side

Pour over any excess broth and drizzle everything with the chilli oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
