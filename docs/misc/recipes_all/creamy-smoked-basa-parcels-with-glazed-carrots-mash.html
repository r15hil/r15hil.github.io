<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and chop your smoked basa fillet[s] into small, bite-sized pieces

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[115ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [150ml] </span>boiled water

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped garlic, vegetable stock and soft cheese with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min, stirring until fully combined

Add the chopped basa and dried oregano and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once cooked through, transfer the fish mixture to a bowl and set aside to cool, reserve the pan

Peel and chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry and reboil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the fish mixture has cooled, dust a work surface with a small handful of flour and unwrap your puff pastry, then roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut the puff pastry into 2 squares per person and add them to a non-stick baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)

Divide the creamy fish mixture evenly between each piece of pastry, leaving a 1cm border around the edge</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Brush the edge of each pastry square with a little bit of cold water then bring each corner together, pressing the edges to seal and leaving a small opening at the top

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden, cooked through and the edges have puffed up – these are your creamy smoked basa parcels

Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return to a high heat and add the carrot batons with 100ml<span class="text-purple"> [130ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water, a knob of butter and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook, covered for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, remove the lid and cook for a final 3 min or until the liquid has fully evaporated and the carrots are starting to char – these are your glazed carrots</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Return the drained potatoes to the pot over a low heat with a large splash of milk and a drizzle of olive oil

Mash until smooth and stir through 2/3 of the chopped parsley (save the rest for later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your parsley mash</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy smoked basa parcels with the parsley mash, glazed carrots and cranberry sauce to the side

Sprinkle the remaining chopped parsley over the mash

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
