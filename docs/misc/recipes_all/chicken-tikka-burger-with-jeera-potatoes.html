<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the grill to high

Boil a kettle and chop your waxy potatoes in half

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Combine the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, your garam masala, ground turmeric, ground paprika and small dollop of your natural yoghurt in a large bowl (save the rest for later!)

Season with salt and pepper and add the juice of half your lemon[s] with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil – this is your tikka marinade</p><br><br>

Stir it all together

Cut the remaining lemon in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the marinated chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray under the grill for 10-12 min or until the chicken is beginning to brown and is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken tikka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel lengths off your cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber ribbons

Chop the remaining cucumber core finely

Combine the chopped cucumber core with the remaining natural yoghurt and your mint sauce

Season with a pinch of salt – this is your cucumber & mint raita</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your brioche bun[s], cut side down, and toast for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and return to the pot

Return the potatoes to a medium heat with a large knob of butter and your cumin seeds

Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min or until sizzling and fragrant

Squeeze in the juice of half the remaining<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon and give everything a good mix up – these are your jeera potatoes

Chop the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your burger, layer the toasted brioche base with a dollop of cucumber & mint raita, the chicken tikka and the cucumber ribbons and top with a toasted brioche lid – this is your chicken tikka burger

Serve the jeera potatoes and remaining cucumber & mint raita to the side

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
