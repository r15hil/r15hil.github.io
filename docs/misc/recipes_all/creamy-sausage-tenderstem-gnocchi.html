<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and break up into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your gnocchi and cook for 8-10 min or until beginning to crisp

Tip: Don't stir too often as this will prevent the gnocchi from crisping!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your Tenderstem broccoli in half

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s] and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your soft cheese in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water – this is your creamy stock

Once the shallot has browned, add the creamy stock to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until the Tenderstem is softened and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<p>Add the garlic & rosemary gnocchi to the pan with the sausage meat and give everything a good mix up until coated in the sauce

Stir through half of your grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your creamy sausage, rosemary & garlic gnocchi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
