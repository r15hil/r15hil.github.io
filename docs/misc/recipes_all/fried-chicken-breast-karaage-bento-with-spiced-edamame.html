<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Combine your mayo with a splash of rice vinegar and a pinch of salt – this is your Japanese-style mayo

Cut your cucumber into quarters lengthways, then slice finely and add to a bowl

Add the remaining rice vinegar to the sliced cucumber with a pinch of salt and sugar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get perfectly fluffy rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and ginger

Add your diced chicken breast to a bowl with the chopped garlic and ginger, your soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and stir to combine

Add your cornflour and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken breast pieces and cook for 10-12 min on each side or until golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken karaage</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Add the salad to the quick-pickled cucumber and give everything a good mix up – this is your quick-pickled cucumber salad

Rinse your blanched edamame beans under cold running water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the blanched edamame beans to a bowl and microwave for 1 min, or until hot and cooked with a bite

Add your black sesame seeds and toasted sesame oil to the sticky rice just before serving, and gently stir it all together – this is your sticky sesame rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fried chicken karaage alongside the sticky sesame rice, quick-pickled cucumber salad and cooked edamame (for fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out)

Season the cooked edamame with your shichimi togarashi (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and add the Japanese-style mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
