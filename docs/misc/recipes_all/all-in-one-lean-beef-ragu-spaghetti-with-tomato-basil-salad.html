<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your lean beef mince to the dish and break up with a wooden spoon

Peel and grate your garlic

Add your tomato paste, grated garlic and a knob of butter to the dish and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomatoes, beef stock mix, balsamic vinegar and 650ml <span class="text-purple">[850ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.1L] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat, season generously with salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30 min – this is your lean beef ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>After 30 min, remove the lean beef ragù from the oven

Break your spaghetti in half and add it to the dish, giving everything a good mix up to separate the strands

Return the dish to the oven and cook, covered, for a final 25 min or until the spaghetti is tender and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your all-in-one lean beef ragù spaghetti</p><br><br>

<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the ragù is almost done, slice your tomato[es] finely and add to a bowl

Roughly tear half your basil leaves (save the rest for garnish!) over the top

Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper – this is your tomato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, give the all-in-one lean beef ragù spaghetti a good mix up with a fork to separate the strands of pasta and sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese all over

Roughly tear the remaining basil leaves over the top

Serve the tomato salad to the side
