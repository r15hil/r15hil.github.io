<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper

Add the basa fillets to a plate and use the back of a spoon to spread the miso paste over both sides of the fish until evenly coated

Then season with salt and pepper – this is your miso basa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Sprinkle the cornflour all over the miso basa and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated

Tip: Coat the fish in the cornflour one side at a time to avoid stickiness!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated miso basa and cook for 8-9 min, turning once halfway until golden, crisp and cooked through – this is your crispy miso basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, add the peas to a pot and cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them)

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chips are almost cooked, slice the brioche buns in half

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Return the drained peas to a low heat with a knob of butter

Once melted, remove from the heat and stir in the wasabi paste

Mash the peas roughly with a potato masher until lightly crushed – these are your wasabi peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are golden and crisp, remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle over the shichimi togarashi

Carefully mix everything together – these are your togarashi chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top each brioche base with some mayo, the crispy miso basa, the wasabi peas and another dollop of mayo, then top with the brioche lid

Serve the togarashi chips to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
