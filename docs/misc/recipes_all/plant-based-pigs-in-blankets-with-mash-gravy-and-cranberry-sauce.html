<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle, then peel and chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces, add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 14-16 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free sausages and cook for 4 min or until lightly browned all over, then transfer the browned meat-free sausages to a plate and reserve the pan for later

Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine half your Henderson's Relish (you'll use the rest later!) with your ground smoked paprika, agave, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your smoky marinade

Line a baking tray with a large piece of tin foil (or two!), add the sliced spring greens to the middle with a few small knobs of butter alternative and 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water, then scrunch the edges of the foil around the greens to form a sealed parcel[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel your parsnip[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of parsnip ribbons

Add the parsnip ribbons to the smoky marinade and gently mix together until nicely coated – these are your smoky parsnip ribbons

Lay several smoky parsnip ribbons together on a chopping board to make a thicker strip, then repeat this process until you are left with 3 thick strips per person – these are your blankets</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Wrap the browned meat-free sausages in the blankets and add them to the tray – these are your plant-based pigs in blankets

Put the tray in the oven, along with the tray of spring greens, for 15 min or until the sliced spring greens are tender and the plant-based pigs in blankets are golden and cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a large knob of butter alternative and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, until you're left with a sandy paste

Gradually stir in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and add your soy sauce, vegetable stock mix and the remaining Henderson's Relish

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 4 min or until thickened – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter alternative

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth

Once the gravy has thickened, season it with a pinch of sugar and a very generous grind of black pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based pigs in blankets over the mash with the tender spring greens to the side

Drizzle the gravy all over and serve with a dollop of cranberry sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
