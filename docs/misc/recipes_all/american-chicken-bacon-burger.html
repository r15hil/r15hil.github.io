<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place your hand flat&nbsp;onto&nbsp;the&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces of&nbsp;chicken


Combine the smoked paprika, cayenne pepper&nbsp;(Can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span>&nbsp;black pepper&nbsp;and a very large pinch of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;on a plate


Add the&nbsp;sliced&nbsp;chicken and mix to evenly coat in the spices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil


Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 3-4 min on each side pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, sandwich the&nbsp;spiced&nbsp;chicken, bacon and&nbsp;a dollop of ranch sauce in between&nbsp;the toasted brioche


Skewer to hold everything together


Serve the sweet potato chips&nbsp;and little gem wedges on the side, with the&nbsp;remaining ranch sauce drizzled over&nbsp;


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
