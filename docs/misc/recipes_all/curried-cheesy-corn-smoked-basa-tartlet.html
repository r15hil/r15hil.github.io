Put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the filling is bubbling and golden – this is your curried, cheesy corn & smoked basa tartlet

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

Drizzle a little olive oil and your white wine vinegar over the salad – this is your dressed salad

Top the curried, cheesy corn & smoked basa tartlet with the sliced spring onion and serve the dressed salad to the side
