<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 230ºC/ 210ºC (fan)/ gas 8 and boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into quarters, then add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain, reserve the pot and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your cod fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Drain your king prawns, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle a little flour over the chopped cod and king prawns, then toss until lightly floured</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Peel and grate your garlic

Combine the grated cheese and cornflour in a pot with a pinch of salt and pepper and mix until the cheese is fully coated

Add your Dijon mustard, soft cheese and half the grated garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot with 125ml<span class="text-purple"> [190ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml] </span>milk – this is your mornay base</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat the pot with the mornay base over a medium heat

Cook for 1-2 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your mornay sauce

Add the floured cod & king prawns to the mornay sauce with a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your mornay fish mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the mornay fish mix to an oven-proof dish (use individual ones for fancy presentation!) and top with your panko breadcrumbs, a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Put the dish[es] in the oven and cook for 18-22 min or until bubbling and golden and the fish is cooked through – this is your creamy cod & king prawn mornay

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the mornay is nearly ready, reboil the kettle and return the reserved pot to a low heat with a little drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your dried oregano with the remaining grated garlic and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the drained potatoes to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper and a little drizzle of olive oil and cook for 1-2 min or until very fragrant – these are your garlic & oregano potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach

Add the spinach and blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Combine the refreshed spinach and peas with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> butter and a pinch of salt – this is your buttered veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy cod & king prawn mornay with the garlic & oregano potatoes and buttered veg to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
