<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the shallot halves, tomato wedges and chopped red pepper to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and panko breadcrumbs to a bowl with half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), fennel seeds and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, divide into 5 per person and roll into meatballs – these are your pork meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for an initial 4-5 min or until starting to brown all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your conchiglie to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the conchiglie for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the conchiglie, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Reboil half a kettle

Once the veg is tender and slightly charred, add the roasted veg to the food processor with half your Greek cheese (save the rest for garnish!), your tomato paste, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[ 1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, the remaining chopped garlic and chicken stock mix

Blitz until well combined and smooth – this is your Greek cheese & red pepper sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are browned, add the Greek cheese & red pepper sauce to the pan with 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[195ml]</span> [250ml] </span>boiled water and cook, covered, for 8-10 min further or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, add the drained conchiglie to the pan and give everything a good mix – these are your pork meatballs with Greek cheese & red pepper conchiglie

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork meatballs with Greek cheese & red pepper conchiglie and crumble the remaining Greek cheese on top

Season with a grind of black pepper
