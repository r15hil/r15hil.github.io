<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under cold running water, then add it to a pot with a matching lid with 250ml <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender, then remove from the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the ground allspice in a large mixing bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> each of salt and pepper, then add the chicken thighs and coat thoroughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken thighs and cook on each side for 3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Transfer the chicken thighs to a baking tray and reserve the pan

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a clean board and leave to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, boil half a kettle

Chop the dried cranberries coarsely

Add them to a bowl and cover with enough boiled water to cover completely (this helps them become juicy and plump)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the blanched almonds to a separate tray, drizzle them with a little olive oil and place them in the oven for 3-4 min or until slightly darkened in colour

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once done, remove from the oven and sprinkle with salt

Leave them to cool on the tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the nuts are cooling, peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat, then once hot add the chopped shallot

Cook for 2-3 min, then add the cooked quinoa, coating all the grains in the oil

Remove from the heat and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Strip the mint leaves and dill leaves from their stalks and chop finely

Crumble the Greek cheese, then chop the cooled almonds coarsely

Drain the cranberries

Finely slice the cooked chicken thighs on a clean board

Wash the  lambs lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the drained cranberries, almonds, mint, dill, crumbled Greek cheese and lambs lettuce to the quinoa with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and the white wine vinegar and mix gently to combine – this is your jewelled quinoa

Serve the sliced chicken over the jewelled quinoa

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
