<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and reserve about 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

Cut your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, add the drained farfalle to the pan with the chicken and onion

Add your vegetable stock mix with the chopped basil, soft cheese, pesto, half your grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>reserved starchy pasta water

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1-2 min or until the sauce is creamy and starting to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach and stir through until wilted – this is your creamy chicken & pesto farfalle

Tip: If the sauce is looking a little dry add a splash more starchy pasta water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken & pesto farfalle

Garnish with the remaining grated cheese and basil leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
