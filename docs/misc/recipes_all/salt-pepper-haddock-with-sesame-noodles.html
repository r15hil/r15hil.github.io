<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper and cut into large bite-sized chunks

Add the haddock chunks to a bowl with your cornflour, a generous pinch of salt, a grind of black pepper and your five-spice mix and give everything a good mix up until well coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated haddock and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crispy and the fish is cooked through – this is your crispy haddock

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the haddock is cooking, finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds

Trim, then roughly chop your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into batons

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fine egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until tender, then drain, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water

Once drained, return the noodles to the pot and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the haddock is crispy, add the spring onion batons to the pan with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and chopped garlic

Cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, transfer everything to a plate (save the pan!) and set aside until serving – this is your salt & pepper haddock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pepper strips and cook for 2 min or until slightly softened

Meanwhile, combine your soy sauce and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl with your rice vinegar – this is your sesame dressing

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pepper is cooked, add the drained noodles and spinach to the pan

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy noodle water if it's looking a little dry

Turn off the heat and stir through the sesame dressing – these are your sesame noodles</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up your sesame noodles with your salt & pepper haddock to one side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
