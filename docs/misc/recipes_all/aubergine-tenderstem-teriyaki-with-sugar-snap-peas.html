<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped aubergine and your Tenderstem broccoli to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the vegetables are softened and lightly golden – this is your roasted veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the veg is roasting, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped ginger, your rice vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy), toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> brown sugar in a bowl

Give it a good mix up – this is your teriyaki sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the roasted veg is done, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the roasted veg with the teriyaki sauce to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has reduced to a sticky consistency – this is your aubergine & Tenderstem teriyaki</p><br><br>

Remove the aubergine & Tenderstem teriyaki from the heat and add your toasted sesame seeds to the pan</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the aubergine & Tenderstem teriyaki over the cooked rice and peas

Garnish with the sliced spring onion
