<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat, then once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy

Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the brown onions and garlic clove[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once golden, remove the crispy bacon lardons from the pot (reserve the pot!) and set aside for later

Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add the sliced onion, sliced garlic, a knob of butter, 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water and a generous pinch of salt

Use one thyme sprig (or a piece of string) to tie a knot around your thyme and rosemary sprigs and add to the pot

Cook for 15 min or until the onion is very soft, stirring frequently</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] into 5 thin slices per person

Add the ciabatta slices to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 7-8 min or until the ciabatta is toasted and golden

Once done, remove the tray from the oven and set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Cook for 10-12 min further or until caramelised

Tip: Watch them like a hawk and stir frequently to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has caramelised, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour to the pot and cook for 1 min

Add 700ml<span class="text-purple"> [1.1L] </span><span class="text-danger">[1.4L]</span> boiled water, beef stock mix, Henderson's Relish and the crispy bacon lardons to the pot, and bring to a boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Discard the rosemary & thyme sprigs and season very generously with salt and pepper – this is your French onion & bacon soup

Set the soup aside for 4-5 min to allow the flavours to develop

Meanwhile, top the toasted ciabatta slices with the cheddar slices and chopped dates and return the baking tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy date toasts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, spoon the French onion & bacon soup into a bowl and top with a few of the cheesy date toasts

Drizzle your red wine vinegar and a little olive oil over the washed salad and serve to the side with the remaining cheesy date toasts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
