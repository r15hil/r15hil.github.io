<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into small, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Pick a few leaves from the coriander (save these for garnish!), then chop the rest finely, including the stalks

Zest the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Roll the zested lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the jackfruit to a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold water

Squeeze each piece of jackfruit to remove as much brine as you can

Add the rinsed jackfruit to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball, twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can

Chop the drained jackfruit into small pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have steam dried, mash them until smooth

Add the chopped jackfruit, soy sauce, juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, lime zest, chopped ginger, chopped coriander and Thai red curry paste to the pot with the mashed potato and mix to combine – this is your jackfruit mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Divide the jackfruit mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span>, then shape them into 'fish' cakes

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a plate with a drizzle of vegetable oil and mix together

Press the 'fish' cakes into the panko breadcrumbs until evenly coated

Add the 'fish' cakes to a tin foil-lined tray and put in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Crush the peanuts in the bag with a rolling pin

Combine the juice of the remaining lime with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime dressing

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and add it the lime dressing, along with the crushed peanuts and roasted sweet potato

Toss everything together – this is your sweet potato & lime salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Combine the chilli jam with the mayo – this is your chilli mayo

Serve the Thai jackfruit 'fish' cakes with the sweet potato & lime salad to the side

Drizzle the chilli mayo over the 'fish' cakes

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
