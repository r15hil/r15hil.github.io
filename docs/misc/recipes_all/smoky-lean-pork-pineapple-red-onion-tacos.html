<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to medium-high and add the chopped garlic and your lean pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and soy sauce, then cook for a further 8-10 min or until the pork mince is cooked through (no pink meat!) and starting to crisp – this is your smoky lean pork mince</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then separate the outer lettuce leaves and finely shred the inner core[s]

Drain and finely dice your pineapple

Tip: Don’t chuck pineapple juice down the drain. Instead, add it to your smoothies, cakes or marinades!

Combine the shredded lettuce, diced pineapple and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) in a bowl with plenty of black pepper – this is your pineapple salsa</p><br><br>
