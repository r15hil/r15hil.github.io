<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, cut down the middle lengthways, remove the tough outer layers and set aside for later then chop the softer inner core[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water, the outer lemongrass layers and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and stir for 1 min, then cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your fragrant rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then cut into bite-sized pieces

Deseed your sweet pointed pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Cut your red chilli[s] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped aubergine and cook for 5 min or until starting to brown

Once starting to brown, add a drizzle of vegetable oil and the chopped pepper and cook for a further 2 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the vegetables cook, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and soy sauce in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Add the chopped ginger, chopped lemongrass inner core with your red Thai curry paste and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the coconut stock to the pan with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 10-15 min or until the sauce has thickened and the vegetables are tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Once the vegetables are tender, add the chopped coriander stalks and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan (you'll use the rest later!) – this is your Thai-style aubergine curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style aubergine curry over the fragrant rice, discard the outer lemongrass layers

Garnish with the crushed peanuts, reserved coriander leaves and remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Cut the remaining lime into wedges and serve to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
