<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Pat your pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then score the fatty side in a criss-cross pattern by drawing a sharp knife through the skin, deep enough to reach the meat below

Season with a generous pinch of salt and rub it deep into the criss-cross pattern</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the pork belly, fat-side down and cook for 4 min or until golden and crispy, then flip and cook for 2 min on the other side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain your pineapple, (save the juice, you'll use it later!)

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut 2 pieces of tin foil approx. the size of A4 paper

Lay the onion wedges in the middle of the 2 pieces of foil, (doubling it up prevents any leakages!) and top with your dried bay leaf[ves] and the browned pork (skin-side up)

Loosely scrunch the edges of the foil around the pork leaving the skin exposed and transfer the parcel[s] to a baking tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water with the pineapple juice, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt – this is your stock

Pour the stock around the pork

Put the tray in the oven for 1 hour or until the pork skin is crisp and the meat is cooked through and tender (no pink meat!) – this is your Filipino-style pork belly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the pork is cooking, dice the pineapple finely

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine the diced pineapple and spring onion in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your pineapple salsa

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pork has had 45 min, add the sliced garlic with a drizzle of olive oil to a medium pot with a lid and fry for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Add your white long grain rice with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat then reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed

Once cooked through remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your garlic rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once the pork is ready, transfer it to a clean chopping board and slice into 2 slices per person

Serve the Filipino-style pork belly slices topped with the cooked onion and stock from the foil parcel

Serve the garlic rice and pineapple salsa to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
