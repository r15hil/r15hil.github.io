<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 80ml<span class="text-purple"> [120ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[160ml] </span>milk to a bowl with half your cider vinegar (you’ll use the rest later!) – this is your marinade

Add your chicken thighs to the marinade and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later

Tip: This will help to tenderise your chicken!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your cucumber finely into discs

Add the cucumber discs and the remaining cider vinegar to a bowl with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cucumber</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot with 10g <span class="text-purple">[15g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter over a low heat

Once melted, remove the pot from the heat and add your sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Stir everything together until fully combined with a sauce-like consistency – this is your buffalo sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Peel and grate your garlic

Add your mayo to a bowl with your dried oregano, grated garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> of the pickling liquid from the quick-pickled cucumber and a pinch of pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your ranch-style dip</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-6-copy-1650387457547-x200.jpg' alt='Step 6 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Discard all the excess marinade from the chicken

Add your ground smoked paprika, cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>flour to the bowl with the marinated chicken

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is fully coated</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1650387545168-x200.jpg' alt='Step 7 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 8 min on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your fried chicken

Add the brioche halves to a separate baking tray, cut side up, and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, spread a little bit of the ranch-style dip on the warmed brioche base, top with a handful of the quick-pickled cucumber and the fried chicken, then drizzle the buffalo sauce over the top

Top with the warmed brioche bun lid and serve the fries with the remaining quick-pickled cucumber and ranch-style dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
