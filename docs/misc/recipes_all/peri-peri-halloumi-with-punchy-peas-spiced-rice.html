<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Slice the halloumi into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>pieces, lengthways

Add the sliced halloumi to a large bowl with half the peri-peri spice mix (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar, half the red wine vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a small drizzle of olive oil

Give everything a good mix up then set aside for later – this is your marinated halloumi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the halloumi is marinating, peel and grate (don't chop!) the garlic

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> roughly

Heat a pot with a lid on a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add half the grated garlic (save the rest for later!) with the ground smoked paprika, ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped tomato, white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your spiced rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining grated garlic, remaining peri-peri spice mix (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant – this is your peri-peri tomato mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the peri-peri tomato mix to a small bowl with the remaining red wine vinegar, mayo and a pinch of sugar and mix until fully combined (reserve the pan!) – this is your perinaise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated halloumi and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until the halloumi is browned – this is your peri-peri halloumi

Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate pot on a medium heat with a small knob of butter

Once hot, add the blanched peas and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min or until they're warmed through

Once warmed through, add the chopped mint and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – these are your punchy peas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the peri-peri halloumi with the punchy peas, spiced rice and perinaise to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
