<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>butter out of the fridge and set aside to soften

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for an initial 20-25 min or until it's almost cooked

Once almost cooked, drain and return it to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand your mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s]

Tip: If you feel resistance against your knife, it means you are hitting the stone

Dice the mango flesh finely, discarding the stone[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Zest half your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your creamed coconut finely

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped mango to a bowl with the shredded lettuce, sliced spring onion and chopped green chilli

Add the lime zest with the juice of half your lime[s], a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and toss together – this is your mango & lime salad

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Combine the softened butter with your jerk paste – this is your jerk butter</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add the chopped creamed coconut and drained black beans to the pot with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [85ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt

Cover with a lid and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 min or until the coconut has melted and the water has absorbed – this is your coconut rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your basa fillet[s] with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once the fish is cooked, carefully spread the jerk butter over the basa with the back of a spoon and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the butter has melted over the fish – this is your jerk-spiced basa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the jerk-spiced basa with the coconut rice and mango & lime salad to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
