<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and drain your sweetcorn

Wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool and once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large dry pan over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your roasted peanuts and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to toast

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once slightly toasted, add half your honey (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with a few generous grinds of pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until caramelised

Once caramelised, transfer the peanuts to a plate to cool into a brittle and reserve the pan – these are your honey pepper peanuts

Reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a little drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add your lean beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Cook for a further 4 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fine egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Drain the soaked noodles, reserving 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> starchy noodle water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, add 2/3 of the sliced spring onion (save the rest for garnish!), the chopped garlic, drained sweetcorn and wilted spinach to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until the garlic has softened

Once softened, add your cornflour, remaining honey and soy sauce with the reserved starchy noodle water and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained noodles and cook for a further 2-3 min or until everything's coated in sauce – this is your lean beef & sweetcorn stir-fry

Chop the honey pepper peanuts roughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lean beef & sweetcorn stir-fry

Top with the remaining sliced spring onion and chopped honey pepper peanuts

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave out the peanuts and spring onion!</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
