<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, add your chicken breast portion[s] to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film

Bash the chicken breast portions with a rolling pin until evenly flattened – these are your chicken escalopes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Season the chicken escalopes with pepper

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken escalopes and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water

Cut your lemon[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Trim, then add your green beans to a pot, cover them with boiled water (just enough to cover them) with a pinch of salt

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for an initial 2-3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, add 30g <span class="text-purple">[45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> butter to the pan along with your sage leaves and sliced garlic and cook for 2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chicken stock and the juice of half your lemon[s] to the pan and cook for 4 min further or until reduced to a gravy-like consistency – this is your lemon & sage butter chicken

Once the green beans have had an initial 2-3 min, add your blanched peas to the pot, and cook for a further 1 min or until everything's tender – these are your greens

Once done, drain the greens and cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemon & sage butter chicken over the cooked brown rice with the greens to the side

Drizzle any remaining sage butter sauce from the pan over everything

Garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
