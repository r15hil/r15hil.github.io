<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Roast the duck legs


Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan)/ 375°F/ Gas 5 and boil a kettle.


Add the duck legs to a baking tray and season all over with a pinch of salt.


Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20-25 minutes, or until you reach step 3.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Par-boil the potatoes


Meanwhile, peel the potatoes (chop any large potatoes in half).


Add the potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-15 minutes or until fork-tender.


Once the potatoes are done, drain and leave them to steam dry for 5 minutes.


Tip: <span class="text-highlight">For</span> extra crispy potatoes, shake them around in a colander to fluff up the edges a little before roasting!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Roast the potatoes 


Once the potatoes are done, remove the duck legs from the oven. 


Add the drained potatoes with a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up until coated in all of the duck fat (add a little vegetable oil if they're looking a little dry!).


Return the tray to the oven for 50 minutes further, or until the duck is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the potatoes are golden and crispy.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Roast the cauliflower 


Meanwhile, cut the cauliflower into florets. 


Add the cauliflower florets to a baking tray, drizzle with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt.


Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender and golden.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Make the redcurrant jus


Meanwhile, dissolve 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> <span class="text-highlight">Knorr</span> chicken stock cube (save the rest for later!) and the redcurrant jelly in 250ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water.


Add the stock to a pot and bring to the boil over a high heat.


Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by half. 


Once reduced, add a knob of butter and cook for 1-2 minutes further or until thick and glossy – this is your redcurrant jus.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bake the cauliflower cheese


Meanwhile, dissolve the remaining stock cube in 50ml<span class="text-danger"> [100ml]</span> boiled water. Grate the cheddar cheese.


Heat a pot over a medium heat with a small knob of butter. Once melted, add 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 minutes or until a roux (sandy paste) has formed. Stir the chicken stock gradually into the roux and stir in the truffle flavoured oil, Dijon mustard, crème fraîche and grated cheese – this is your truffle cheese sauce. 


Add the roasted cauliflower to an oven-proof dish and pour over the truffle cheese sauce. Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden.</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Make your garlic chard


Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic.


Return the pan that was used to boil your potatoes, to a medium heat with a knob of butter. Once melted, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant.


Add the baby red chard with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 minutes or until slightly wilted – this is your garlic chard.</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve up!


Serve the duck leg with the roasted potatoes, truffled cauliflower cheese and garlic chard to the side. 


Drizzle over the redcurrant jus. 


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
