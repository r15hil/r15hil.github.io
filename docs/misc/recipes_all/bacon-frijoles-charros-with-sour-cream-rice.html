<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your smoked streaky bacon to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Combine the juice of half your lime[s] with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and the sliced spring onion in a medium bowl – this is your lime pickle

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Reduce the heat to low and add a small knob of butter with the chopped garlic, southern fried seasoning, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and drained beans

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar with a grind of pepper and cook for 2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped bacon and chicken stock mix with your chopped tomatoes and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[255ml]</span> boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 7-10 min or thickened – this is your bacon frijoles charros

Once ready, set aside for a few minutes, covered, for the flavours to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the beans are cooking, chop your tomato[es] finely

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save some leaves for garnish!)

Add the chopped tomato and coriander to the lime pickle with a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your lime salsa

Chop your remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bacon frijoles charros with the cooked rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Dollop over your soured cream and the lime salsa and garnish with reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
