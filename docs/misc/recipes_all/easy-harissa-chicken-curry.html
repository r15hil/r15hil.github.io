<p><strong>Description:</strong> Harissa is a North African spice paste sometimes described as the â€˜national condiment of Tunisia'. It's also widely used in Morocco and Algeria, particularly in meat stews and couscous dishes. This curry is served with cool yoghurt and is cooked with potatoes, so no need for rice. Just grab a spoon and tuck in!</p>
