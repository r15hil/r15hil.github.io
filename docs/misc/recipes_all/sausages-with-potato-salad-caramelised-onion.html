<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sausages are in the oven, peel and finely slice the red onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt

Cook for 5 min, or until the onion has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warm potato salad topped with the cooked sausages and caramelised onions

Drizzle over the reserved dressing
