<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) adding 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a high heat

Roughly chop your courgette[s] into batons

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped courgette, sliced pepper and your diced chicken breast to the pan and cook for 10 min or until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Note: Please make sure you cook your chicken thoroughly (until there’s no pink meat and it’s piping hot!) as cooking equipment varies</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your wholewheat noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and stir for 10 secs to separate the noodles

Set aside to soak for 4 min

Reserve a cup of starchy noodle water, then drain the soaked noodles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
