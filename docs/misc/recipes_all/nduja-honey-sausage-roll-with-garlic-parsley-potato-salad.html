<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 rectangle per person

Add the pastry rectangle[s] to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Tear your 'Nduja into small pieces

Combine your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) with the torn 'Nduja, half your Dijon mustard (you'll use the rest later!) and half your honey (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of pepper – this is your sausage mixture

Divide the sausage mixture equally and press into a sausage shape (1 per person) and lay in the middle of the pastry rectangle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the mixture, then crimp the sealed edges with a fork – this is your sausage roll[s]

Score the top of the sausage roll[s], then brush with a little milk

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and puffed up – this is your 'Nduja & honey sausage roll</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the sausage roll[s] is cooking, chop your waxy potatoes into quarters

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your tomato[es] finely

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Combine your white wine vinegar with the remaining honey and a little drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl – this is your dressing

Add the chopped tomato and baby leaf salad to the dressing and toss – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork tender, drain and return to the pot

Add the chopped garlic with a small knob of butter, the remaining Dijon mustard, a pinch of salt and pepper and the chopped parsley

Return the pot to a low heat and cook for 1-2 min or until the butter has melted and the garlic is fragrant – this is your warm garlic & parsley potato salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the 'Nduja & honey sausage roll with the warm garlic & parsley potato salad and the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
