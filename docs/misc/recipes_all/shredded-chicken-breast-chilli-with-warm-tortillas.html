<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil half a kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air

Add your ground cumin, ground smoked paprika and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until combined

Add your chicken breast portion[s] to the plate and turn them several times until evenly coated in all the spices</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the coated chicken and any remaining spices and cook for 3 min on each side until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<p>Serve the shredded chicken breast chilli with the warmed tortillas

Dollop with your natural yoghurt, grate your cheddar cheese all over and garnish with the coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
