<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) to the pan and cook for 4 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go, then cook for a further 3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi</p><br><br>
