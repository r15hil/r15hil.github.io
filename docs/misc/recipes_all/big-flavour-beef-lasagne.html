<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, add your beef mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> milk to a pot over a low heat with your bay leaf[ves] and leave to infuse for 4-5 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Grate your Italian hard cheese

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the beef mince has browned, tear your chestnut mushrooms into the pan with your hands

Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your ragù

Remove the bay leaf[ves] from the infused milk and discard</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>olive oil to a separate pot over a medium heat

Once hot, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

Add the infused milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Remove from the heat and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your béchamel</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Layer some of the ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with some of your lasagne sheets

Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets

Tip: You may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish

Cover with the béchamel, top with the grated Italian hard cheese and cook in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Combine your balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

Serve the lasagne with the salad to the side and the dressing drizzled over and enjoy!
