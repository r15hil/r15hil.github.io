<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7


Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the browned broccoli quarters to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 8 min or until the broccoli is tender – this is your charred broccoli
