<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it air, then boil a kettle and heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your coriander seeds and fennel seeds and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant and toasted, then transfer to a food processor and reserve the pan for later

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your free range chicken breast portion[s] into rough bite-sized pieces

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, and once hot add the chopped chicken and cook for 3-4 min or until browned

Once browned, add your ground turmeric and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the browned chicken to a plate, reserve the pan and juices</p><br><br>

<p>Peel and roughly chop your shallot[s]

Roughly chop your tomato[es]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Peel and roughy chop your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot, tomato, ginger and garlic to the food processor with the spices

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and blitz until smooth – this is your spice paste

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chicken stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the reserved pan and chicken juices to a medium-high heat and add the spice paste then cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant

Whilst the spice paste is cooking, trim and chop the green beans in half

Once fragrant, add the browned chicken, halved green beans and coconut stock and cook for 6-8 min or until thickened to a curry-like consistency and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Keralan-style free range chicken curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, zest half your lime[s]

Cut your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Add the lime zest and half of the chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) to the basmati rice and give it a good mix up – this is your lime & chilli rice

Squeeze the juice of half the lime[s] over the Keralan-style free range chicken curry, then cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Keralan-style free range chicken curry with the lime & chilli rice

Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
