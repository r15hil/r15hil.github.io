<p><strong>Description:</strong> Britain has always had a love affair with Indian food. This delightfully creamy and lightly spiced curry is fragrant with cardamom, coriander and cumin. Weâ€™ve used natural yoghurt instead of cream, and added ground almonds to thicken. The result; a natural and wholesome curry.</p>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the ground almonds (reserving a little to serve) and the sultanas to the chicken and onion pot
