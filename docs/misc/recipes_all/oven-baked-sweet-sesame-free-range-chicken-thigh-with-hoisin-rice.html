<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into quarters

Add the pepper quarters to a tin foil-lined baking tray (hollow of the pepper facing up)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your toasted sesame oil and half of your gluten free soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a small bowl with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar, ground coriander, a knob of butter and a grind of black pepper – this is your sesame marinade

Add your free range chicken thighs to the sesame marinade and give it a mix up, then top each pepper quarter with a marinated chicken thigh and put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your sweet sesame chicken thigh & charred pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Add your white long grain rice, hoisin sauce, Chinese rice wine, ginger & garlic paste and the remaining gluten free soy sauce to the pot and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chicken stock mix with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the rice is cooked, stir the spinach through until wilted and give everything a good mix up  – this is your hoisin rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the hoisin rice with the sweet sesame free range chicken thigh & charred pepper

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the chicken and drizzle over any remaining juices from the chicken
