Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Once the rice is cooked, add your blanched peas with the chopped mint, sultanas and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your pea & mint pilaf</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the saag butternut squash & cashew curry with the pea & mint pilaf to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
