<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, pat the smoked basa fillets dry with kitchen paper and place on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had 7 min, add the green beans to the pot (check the potatoes are nearly cooked first!) and cook, covered for 4-8 min further or until both the green beans and potatoes are fork-tender

Drain everything and set aside until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a small pot with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the clotted cream and a splash of milk

Whisk to combine into a thin butter sauce, then remove from the heat and add the chopped chives

Season with a small pinch of salt and plenty of pepper – this is your chive butter sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky fish with the green beans and potatoes

Spoon the chive butter sauce over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
