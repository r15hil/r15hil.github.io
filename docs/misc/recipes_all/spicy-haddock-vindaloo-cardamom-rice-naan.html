<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish is a fusion of East and West, with the influence of Portugal shining through. Vinegar was brought over to India in the 16th century by the Portuguese, and thus the characteristic hot, sour flavours of the vindaloo were born. Basil adds a subtle anise flavour. If you like spice, you'll vinda-love it!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife, then add your basmati rice, crushed cardamom pods, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Pat your haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!

Add the haddock bites to a bowl with your cider vinegar, ground cumin, ground paprika, half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coated haddock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and tamarind paste in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tamarind stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add the coated haddock, half your basil leaves (save the rest for garnish!) and a grind of black pepper and cook for 1 min or until the spices are fragrant

Add the tamarind stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the haddock is cooked through – this is your spicy haddock vindaloo

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Slice the remaining basil leaves finely

Tip: Once the vindaloo is done, taste the sauce and stir through any remaining cayenne if it needs more kick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy haddock vindaloo with the cardamom rice and warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the sliced basil leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
