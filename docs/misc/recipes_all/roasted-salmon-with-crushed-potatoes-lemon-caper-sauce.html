<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your salmon fillet[s] to a baking tray, skin-side down (use lightly oiled tin foil to keep them from sticking!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 14-15 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Add your clotted cream and cook for 1-2 min or until melted

Once melted, add the juice of half your lemon[s] and cook for 30 secs further, then season with a pinch of salt – this is your lemon sauce

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
