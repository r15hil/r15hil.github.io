<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into chunks

Peel and cut your red onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are tender, transfer them to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!), reserve the bowl

Add the onion petals, chopped tomatoes and chopped pepper with your dried thyme, ground smoked paprika and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper with a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the veg is roasting, wipe clean the reserved bowl and add your mayo with your roasted garlic paste, a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Add a splash of cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your garlic mayo

Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once slightly wilted, remove the tray[s] from the oven and crumble your Greek cheese around the spinach

Crack your egg[s] onto the spinach with a grind of pepper

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 5-6 min or until the egg is done to your liking – this is your Greek cheese & egg tray bake

Combine half your crispy onions with the garlic mayo – this is your crispy onion garlic mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Greek cheese & egg tray bake and garnish with the remaining crispy onions

Serve the crispy onion garlic mayo to the side
