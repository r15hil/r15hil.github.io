<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle 


Chop the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely, discarding the root end<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Combine the beef mince, panko breadcrumbs and chopped spring onion, then crumble in 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> beef stock cube (you will use the rest later!) with a generous amount of black pepper


Mix thoroughly with clean hands – this is your beef mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut the cheddar cheese into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> pieces


Divide the beef mixture in 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> and shape the mixture into large meatballs 


Push two pieces of cheese (one on top of the other) into the middle of each meatball, and seal up the outside with mince 


Chill the meatballs in the fridge (this ensures they hold their shape when cooking)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the giant couscous to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat 


Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3 min, moving them around so they cook evenly all over 


Once coloured, transfer them to a plate and set aside


Keep the pan for the next step</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Add the chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, balsamic vinegar, remaining 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> stock cube and 600ml <span class="text-danger">[1L]</span> boiled water


Whisk to combine and bring to the boil – this is your tomato broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop (or tear) the basil roughly, including the stalks


Once the meatballs are done, transfer them to serving bowls and continue to cook the tomato broth until it has reduced by half and has reached the consistency of a thick soup, approx. 4-5 min


Once thickened, add the giant couscous and half of the chopped basil to the tomato broth &amp; stir through for 30 sec</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Ladle the tomato couscous broth over the meatballs 


Garnish with the remaining chopped basil and a drizzle of olive oil 


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
