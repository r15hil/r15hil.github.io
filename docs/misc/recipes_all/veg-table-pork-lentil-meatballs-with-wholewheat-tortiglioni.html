<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Top, tail and chop your courgette into quarters lengthways, then chop into small bite-sized pieces

Drain and rinse your green lentils</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required) to a large bowl with half the chopped onion, half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), the drained lentils and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide and shape into meatballs (6 per person!) – these are your pork & lentil meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (or two, preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil, once hot, add the pork & lentil meatballs to the pan[s] and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned, then remove to a plate and reserve the pan[s]

Add the chopped courgette and remaining chopped onion to the reserved pan[s] over a medium-high heat with a splash of cold water, and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften (be careful when adding the water to the pan, it may sizzle from the heat of the oil!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once starting to soften, add the remaining chopped garlic to the pan with your dried oregano and tomato paste and cook for 30 secs until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your chopped tomatoes with your chicken stock mix, a pinch of sugar, a generous pinch of salt and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> cold water, then give everything a good mix up

Return the browned pork & lentil meatballs to the pan and cook, covered for 12-15 min, or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your wholewheat tortiglioni to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the wholewheat tortiglioni for 10-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the wholewheat tortiglioni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked tortiglioni to the pan with a splash of starchy pasta water and gently stir it all together, being careful not to break up the meatballs

Cook for a final 1-2 min or until thickened and the sauce is coating the tortiglioni – this is your pork & lentil meatballs with wholewheat tortiglioni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork & lentil meatballs with wholewheat tortiglioni with the salad to the side

Top the salad with your balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese all over and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
