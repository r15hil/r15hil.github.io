<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the spaghetti for 2-3 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have softened, reduce the heat to medium-high and add your sun-dried tomato paste and finely chopped tomatoes to the pan with your chicken stock mix and cook for 2-3 min further or until thickened

Season with a generous grind of black pepper – this is your bacon & sun-dried tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once thickened, add the drained spaghetti to the bacon & sun-dried tomato sauce and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated – this is your bacon & sun-dried tomato spaghetti

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the bacon & sun-dried tomato spaghetti topped with the salad

Drizzle the salad with a little olive oil and sprinkle your grated Italian hard cheese all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
