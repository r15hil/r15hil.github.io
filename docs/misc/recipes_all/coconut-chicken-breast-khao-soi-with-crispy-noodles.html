<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a full kettle and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel and roughly chop half your brown onion[s], then slice the remaining onion finely

Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your medium egg noodles to a large bowl, cover them with boiled water and set aside to soak for 5-6 min and then drain

Add 1/4 of the soaked noodles to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy – these are your crispy noodles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Top with the quick-pickled shallot and the crispy noodles

Garnish with a lime wedge and the remaining chopped coriander

Serve the zesty green beans to the side and enjoy!</p><br><br>
