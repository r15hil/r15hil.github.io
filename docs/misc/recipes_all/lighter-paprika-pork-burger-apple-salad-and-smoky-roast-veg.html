<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] roughly

Add your butternut squash cubes and chopped carrot to a baking paper-lined tray, drizzle with a little vegetable oil then season with half your smoked paprika (save the rest for later!) and a pinch of salt, then mix everything up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until they're crispy – this is your smoky roast veg</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, trim, then finely slice your spring onion[s]

Combine your pork mince and the remaining smoked paprika in a bowl with half the sliced spring onion (you'll use the rest later!) and your ground coriander

Season very generously with salt and pepper

Divide and shape the mince into 1 patty per person – this is your paprika pork burger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your red onion[s], then slice into thin rings

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion rings and cook for 4-5 min or until the onion has started to caramelised

Once caramelised, set aside until serving and reserve the pan – these are your caramelised onion rings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your red wine vinegar and natural yoghurt in a large bowl with the remaining sliced spring onion and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your salad dressing

Slice your apple[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(skin on) thinly, discard the core[s]

Add the sliced apple to the salad dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed apple</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat

Once hot, add the paprika pork burger[s], press down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

(Tip: Cooking for 5? You may need to do this in batches!)

Flip the paprika pork burger[s] and reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 min further until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and shred roughly

Add the shredded lettuce to the dressed apple and give everything a good mix up – this is your apple salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your bread roll[s] to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 5 min or until they're hot and toasted

Carefully slice in half before serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, sandwich a paprika pork burger, some caramelised onion rings and a little apple salad between the toasted bread roll halves

Serve the smoky roast veg and remaining apple salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
