<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Rinse the sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a generous pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to a gentle boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get perfectly fluffy rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Score a cross very lightly in the base of the tomatoes and add them to a large, heat-proof bowl

Cover the tomatoes with boiled water until fully submerged and set aside until later

Tip: The boiling water loosens the tomato skins for easy peeling!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice the radishes finely then add them to a bowl with half of the rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of sugar and set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled radishes

Trim the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> then chop into batons

Slice each baton into 4 pieces lengthways – this is your shredded spring onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and finely shred

Add the shredded spring greens to a large baking tray and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a large drizzle of vegetable oil

Give everything a good mix up, then put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until crispy – this is your crispy 'seaweed'</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain the soaked tomatoes, then peel the skins off, starting from the cross

Chop the tomatoes into quarters, scoop out and discard the seeds and you'll end up with tomato petals

Return the tomato petals to the bowl and add the tamari soy sauce and mirin then set aside to marinate – this is your tomato sashimi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the edamame beans to a bowl and microwave for 1 min or until piping hot and tender with a bite

Combine the mayo with the wasabi paste and a small splash of water in a bowl – this is your wasabi mayo

Once the sushi rice is done, stir through the remaining rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar – this is your sticky sushi rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky sushi rice in bowls and top with the tomato sashimi, cooked edamame, quick-pickled radishes, shredded spring onion and serve the crispy ‘seaweed’ to the side

Drizzle the remaining sauce over the sashimi and drizzle the wasabi mayo over the edamame and radishes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Sprinkle over the crispy onions and black sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
