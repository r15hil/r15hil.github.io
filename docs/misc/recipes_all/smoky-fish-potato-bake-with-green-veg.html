Once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span><span class="text-danger"> [40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt to the drained potatoes and give everything a good mix up

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the smoked basa pieces to an oven-proof dish, then pour the béchamel sauce over the smoked basa

Top with the drained potatoes (reserve the pot) and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the bake is golden and bubbling, reboil a kettle

Remove the dish from the oven and leave to stand for 5-6 mins – this is your smoky fish & potato bake

Meanwhile, add your trimmed green beans and blanched peas to the reserved pot with a pinch of salt

Cover with boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5 min or until tender – this is your green veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky fish & potato bake with the green veg and a lemon wedge to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
