<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Trim, then cut your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan with the halved green beans and cook for 3-4 min or until the green beans have started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the green beans and prawns are cooking, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, red Thai curry paste and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red Thai curry stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es] of your cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and put the pouch in the microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the red Thai curry stock to the pan with a pinch of salt and your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!)

Cook for 3-4 min further or until the prawns are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to a loose curry-like consistency – this is your red Thai jumbo prawn curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the curry is done, stir through the juice of half your lime[s]

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the red Thai jumbo prawn curry with the cooked brown rice to the side

Garnish with your crispy onions and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
