<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Before you start cooking, take your steaks out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Chop the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the potato wedges to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil with a generous knob of butter and half the miso paste (save the rest for later!)

Scrunch the tin foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to the other side of the baking tray – this is your miso butter corn

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the corn is tender and the wedges are golden and crisp

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic

Trim, then slice the spring onions finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Pat the pork loin steaks dry with kitchen paper, then season both sides with salt

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the seasoned steaks and cook for 3 min on each side or until they're browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once browned, add the Japanese-style BBQ sauce to the pan and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, transfer the cooked steaks to a clean chopping board and leave them to rest for 2 min, reserving the sauce in the pan – this is your Japanese-style BBQ pork loin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the wedges are golden and crisp, remove the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> from the oven

Add the shichimi togarashi to the wedges and give everything a good mix up – these are your togarashi wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Japanese-style BBQ pork loin and pour over the reserved sauce

Serve the miso butter corn and togarashi wedges to the side and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
