<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with a lid with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate your ginger and peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]

Dissolve your pho broth paste in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your pho stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your hake fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Combine your cornflour, ground turmeric, 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl – this is your turmeric cornflour

Add the chopped hake to the turmeric cornflour and give everything a good mix up until fully coated, then set aside for later – these are your coated hake pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the grated ginger, sliced shallot and chopped garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Once softened, add your ground coriander and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant – this is your ginger & shallot mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the ginger & shallot mix to the pot with the brown rice (reserve the pan for later!), then also add in the pho stock, lime leaf[ves], chopped green beans and a generous pinch of salt

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered for an initial 2-3 min or until the green beans are tender

Once tender, add the spinach and carrot ribbons and cook, covered, for a final 1-2 min or until the spinach has wilted – this is your Vietnamese-style rice broth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a medium-high heat with 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp – this is your crispy turmeric hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Vietnamese-style rice broth (discard the lime leaf[ves]) topped with the crispy turmeric hake

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
