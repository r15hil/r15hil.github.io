<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) on a medium heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of olive oil


When hot, add the shallot with a pinch of salt, then cook on a medium low heat for 2 min, until softened but not coloured

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the rice and 2/3 of the garlic to the shallot pan and mix well


Add 1/3 of the stock to the rice and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until the stock is absorbed

<h4>Step 4</h4>

When hot, add the pecan nuts and cook for 5 min, or until slightly darkened in colour

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Place the reserved pan on a medium high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of olive oil


When hot, add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt


Cook them on either side for 3 min, or until golden and caramelised


Tip: Do this in batches as overcrowding prevents proper browning</p><br><br>

Tip: Omit the raw garlic if you're not keen on that strong flavour


Bash in a pestle and mortar (or blitz) until you have a coarse nutty oil</p><br><br>

Add the wilted spinach to the risotto and stir through thoroughly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Stir in half the pecan oil, reserving the rest for garnish


Season the risotto with salt and pepper to your taste


Serve the risotto with the mushrooms on top and the pecan oil drizzled over
