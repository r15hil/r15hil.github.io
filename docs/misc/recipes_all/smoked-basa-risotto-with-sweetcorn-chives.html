<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the risotto has had 20 min, add the drained sweetcorn and smoked basa pieces to the pan and cook for 5-10 min further or until the basa is cooked through, all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is tender

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese and most of the chives (save the rest for garnish!) then discard the bay leaf[ves] – this is your smoked basa & sweetcorn risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your smoked basa & sweetcorn risotto, then garnish with the remaining chopped chives and remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
