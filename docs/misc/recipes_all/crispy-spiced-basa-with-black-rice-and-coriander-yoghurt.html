<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>80g natural yoghurt</li>
<li>1 tomato</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
<li>30g gram flour</li>
<li>15ml soy sauce</li>
<li>2 x 100g basa fillets</li>
<li>15g ginger & garlic paste</li>
<li>5g coriander</li>
<li>130g black rice</li>
<li>1/2 cucumber</li>
<li>1 lemon</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add the black rice to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and cook over a high heat for 30 min or until it's tender (it will still have a slight bite to it when cooked)

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

Cover with a lid until serving</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the basa fillets into large, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped basa with the soy sauce and ginger & garlic paste in a medium bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated basa

Add the gram flour and ground cumin to a separate bowl with most of the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and mix it all together – this is your spiced gram flour</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut the cucumber in half and scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon, then cut into small pieces

Chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Cut the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the chopped cucumber and chopped tomato in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, half the natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!), the remaining cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a pinch of salt – this is your tomato salad

Add the marinated basa to the bowl with the spiced gram flour and give everything a good mix up – this is your coated basa</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy spiced basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining natural yoghurt and chopped coriander to a small bowl with the juice of 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> lemon wedge<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>,<span class="text-danger"> </span>a splash of cold water and a pinch of salt – this is your coriander yoghurt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy spiced basa over the black rice with the tomato salad to the side

Drizzle over the coriander yoghurt and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
