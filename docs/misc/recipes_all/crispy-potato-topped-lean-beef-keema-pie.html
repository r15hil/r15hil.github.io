Put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp – this is your crispy potato-topped lean beef keema pie

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Allow the crispy potato-topped lean beef keema pie to cool slightly before serving (this helps the flavours to develop and makes it easier to serve!)

Serve the crispy potato-topped lean beef keema pie

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
