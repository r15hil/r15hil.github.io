<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic, then chop your coriander, including the stalks (save some leaves for a garnish!)

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) half your ginger, then slice the remaining ginger

Wash your pak choi, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop into quarters lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>cold water, the chopped creamed coconut and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your coconut rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped pak choi to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and the sliced ginger

Scrunch the foil around the pak choi to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the pak choi is tender – this is your ginger pak choi</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Drain your king prawns and pat them dry with kitchen paper, then set aside 3 drained prawns per person and chop the remaining prawns until they are finely minced

Combine your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and the minced prawns in a large bowl with the grated garlic, chopped coriander, grated ginger, panko breadcrumbs, red Thai curry paste and a pinch of salt, then divide and shape into 3 patties per person, then press a reserved prawn firmly into the top of each patty – these are your Thai-style patties</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the Thai-style patties (prawn-side up!) and cook, covered, for 5-6 min, then reduce the heat to medium-high, flip and cook, covered, for a further 5 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Thai-style pork & prawn cakes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your lime[s] in half

Combine your soy sauce, red chilli relish and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your sweet chilli dip

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style pork & prawn cakes with the ginger pak choi, coconut rice and sweet chilli dip to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
