<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your leek[s] in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cut a large piece of tin foil and place it on a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Place your smoked basa fillet[s] in the centre of the foil

Top each basa fillet with a small knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Scrunch the edges of the foil together around the fish to form a tightly sealed parcel[s]

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through (keep the basa in the foil parcels until ready to serve!)

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium-high heat

Once the butter has melted, add the cooked potatoes, sliced leek and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 8-10 min or until the leek has softened and the potatoes are starting to brown, crushing them lightly as they cook

Reboil the kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the spinach, chopped garlic, half the sliced spring onion and half the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!) to the pan

Stir it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until the spinach has wilted, then remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your leek & potato hash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Bring the reserved pot with plenty of boiled water to the boil over a high heat

Crack your egg[s] gently into the water and leave for 3 min

Once done, gently transfer the egg[s] with a slotted spoon to kitchen paper or a clean tea-towel – this is your poached egg[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the leek & potato hash topped with the smoked basa and poached egg

Drizzle any buttery sauce from the fish parcel[s] over the potatoes

Sprinkle the remaining dill and sliced spring onion all over and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
