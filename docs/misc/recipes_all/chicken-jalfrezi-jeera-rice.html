<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Heat a pot with a lid with a large knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once melted, add your cumin seeds and cook for 1 min or until starting to sizzle

Once sizzling, add your basmati rice, stirring to coat the grains in the butter and oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the grains are coated, add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your jeera rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced pepper and tomato wedges and cook for 4-5 min further or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[250ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water and stir in your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, chopped ginger, your curry powder and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Add the tomato stock and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken jalfrezi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken jalfrezi over the jeera rice

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
