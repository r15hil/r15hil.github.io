<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast and cook for 7 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(chop in one bunch for speed)

Wash then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Set aside the green tops, then chop the white bases into rough, large pieces

Discard the tough stalk</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your roasted peanuts, white miso paste, honey, soy sauce and a splash of boiled water to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Meanwhile, drain the noodles and return to the bowl, then stir through your toasted sesame oil – these are your sesame noodles</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the pak choi green tops and cook for 1 min further or until slightly wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your honey miso & peanut chicken breast stir fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the honey miso & peanut chicken breast stir fry over the sesame noodles

Garnish with the remaining chopped spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
