<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Chop your black olives in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tomato & mozzarella tortelloni to a pot of boiled water and bring to a boil over a high heat

Cook the tortelloni for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tortelloni, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained tortelloni to the pan with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce â€“ this is your puttanesca-style sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little thick</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the puttanesca-style sauce with tomato & mozzarella tortelloni topped with the remaining chopped parsley and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
