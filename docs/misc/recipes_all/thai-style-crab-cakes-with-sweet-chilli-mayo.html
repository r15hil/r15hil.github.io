<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the cabbage & carrot slaw mix to a large bowl with the rice vinegar, half the soy sauce and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and sugar, mix it all together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled cabbage & carrot slaw</p><br><br>

Once hot, add 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span> spoonfuls of crab cake mix to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and cooked through – these are your Thai-style crab cakes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the crab cakes are cooking, add the red chilli relish and mayo to a small bowl and mix until fully combined – this is your sweet chilli mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style crab cakes with the chips, quick-pickled cabbage & carrot slaw and a dollop of sweet chilli mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
