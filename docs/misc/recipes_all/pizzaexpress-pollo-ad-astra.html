<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Tip: Keep the pizza dough in the fridge until it is being used

Dice the mozzarella into small bite-sized pieces and add to some kitchen paper, then press down on the diced mozzarella with another piece of kitchen paper to squeeze out as much liquid as you can

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine the dried thyme and smoked paprika on a plate with the ground turmeric, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), dried oregano and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your Cajun seasoning

Transfer half the Cajun seasoning to a bowl and set aside for later – this is your Cajun garnish

Add half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) to the Cajun seasoning, then drizzle olive oil over the chicken breast portions and press them into the Cajun seasoning until evenly coated - this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Deseed the sweet pointed pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice into small bite-sized pieces

Add the coated chicken and chopped pepper to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 15-17 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board (reserve the tray) and shred apart using two forks – this is your pulled chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Cut the PizzaExpress pizza dough in half

Shape the dough into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> balls and set aside for 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>into rings

Combine the remaining chopped garlic with 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the dough balls have rested for 15 min, press your palm into the middle of a dough ball to flatten it until is twice as wide

Turn the dough over and repeat a few times, until approx. 24cm in diameter

Tip: Use a rolling pin to help you!

Repeat with the other dough ball<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> – these are your pizza bases

Transfer the pizza bases to a baking paper-lined baking tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread 2 tbsp finely chopped tomatoes over each pizza base (save the rest for another recipe!) and season with a pinch of salt

Top with the pulled chicken, sliced red onion, roasted peppers, diced mozzarella and sprinkle over the Cajun garnish and the garlic oil

Put the tray in the oven and cook for 10-15 min or until the pizza bases are golden and crisp and the mozzarella has melted – these are your pollo ad astra pizzas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pollo ad astra pizza and season with a double pinch of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
