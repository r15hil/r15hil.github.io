<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil half a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with a knife

Heat a pot with a matching lid with a large knob of butter over a medium heat and once melted, add the crushed cardamom pods and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your basmati rice, sultanas and a pinch of salt and cook for a further 1 min, then add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your cardamom rice

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the chicken stock and ground almonds to the pan and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, stir in your natural yoghurt and cook for a further 1 min or until it's warmed through – this is your mild chicken breast korma</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the mild chicken breast korma with the cardamom rice to the side

Tip: Watch out for the cardamom pods and discard them!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
