<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Place a wide-based pan (ideally non-stick and with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> vegetable oil

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once golden, add a splash of water (approx. 2-3 tbsp) and cover immediately with a lid (stand back as it will spit!)


Tip: The trapped water creates steam for even cooking


Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 7-10 min or until the chicken is cooked through, lowering the heat if necessary</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle for step 5


Peel and cut the carrots into bite-size pieces, discarding the root ends


Trim the green beans and cut them in half widthways


Soak the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">(s)</span> in a bowl of very hot water (this softens it)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the noodles to a pot of salted boiling water (enough to cover them) on a high heat


Boil for 5-7 min or until cooked through but with a slight bite


Once cooked, drain and briefly rinse them under cold, running water until cooled slightly, then return them to the pot off the heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the green beans to the caramelised carrots and cover again with a lid

Meanwhile, peel and chop (or grate) the garlic finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the tamarind paste, coconut cream, honey, soy sauce and garlic with 50ml <span class="text-danger">(100ml)</span> boiled water


Mix well - this is your tamarind sauce&nbsp;


Shred the chicken with two forks, 'pulling' at the chicken to tear it&nbsp;


Chop the spring onions finely, discarding the root ends</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the noodles and shredded chicken to the pan of vegetables and dress with the tamarind sauce


Mix well and serve garnished with chopped spring onion


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
