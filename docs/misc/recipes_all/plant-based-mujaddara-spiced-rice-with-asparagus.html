<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your brown onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar

Reduce the heat to low and cook the onions for 10-12 min or until they have softened and caramelised, stirring frequently</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Add your basmati rice and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[320ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Drain and rinse your green lentils

Trim the woody ends off your asparagus, then chop the asparagus tips away from the stalks and roughly chop the asparagus stalks

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[175ml]</span> boiled water and add your sultanas to soak – this is your sultana stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has caramelised, add the chopped garlic, yellow mustard seeds, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cumin seeds and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the asparagus is tender, add the basmati rice and blanched peas to the pan and give everything a good mix up

Cook for a further 1 min or until the peas are warmed through – this is your plant-based Mujaddara-style rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the plant-based Mujaddara-style rice in bowls and dollop over the cultured coconut

Garnish with your crispy onions and chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
