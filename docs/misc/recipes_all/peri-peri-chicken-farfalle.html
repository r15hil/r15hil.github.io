<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the coated chicken and chopped pepper to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 17-18 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your peri peri chicken

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, add your farfalle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the farfalle, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 175ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [300ml] </span>boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped garlic and remaining peri peri spice mix (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock and soft cheese, bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your peri peri sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is done, transfer to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the pulled chicken, cooked pepper and drained farfalle to the peri peri sauce with a grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce begins to stick to the pasta – this is your peri peri chicken & pepper farfalle

Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Serve the peri peri chicken & pepper farfalle with the salad to the side

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
