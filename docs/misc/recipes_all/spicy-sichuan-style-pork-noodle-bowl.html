<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Add the chopped ginger and chopped garlic to a heat-proof bowl with the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium high heat

Add the toasted sesame oil and heat for 1-2 min or until very hot, then carefully pour the heated toasted sesame oil into the bowl, give it a good mix up and set aside for later (save the pan!) – this is your chilli oil

Tip: Be careful – the garlic and ginger will sizzle from the heat of the oil!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until caramelised, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Top, tail and grate the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (no need to peel!)

Trim, then slice the green beans finely on a diagonal

Trim, then slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the medium egg noodles to a pot and cover them with boiled water until fully submerged

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 5-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of starchy noodle water and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!) to the browned pork mince and the sliced green beans and cook for 4 min further or until the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your soy pork & green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the remaining soy sauce, rice vinegar and peanut butter to the chilli oil with a pinch of sugar and a good grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your sauce

Once the noodles are done, add a splash of the starchy noodle water to the sauce – this is your Sichuan-style chilli sauce

Tip: You want the sauce to be a single cream consistency so it can coat all of the noodles!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the Sichuan-style chilli sauce to the bottom of your serving bowls

Serve the drained noodles on top with the soy pork & green beans and grated carrot

Garnish with the sliced spring onion

To eat, toss the noodles and veg through the Sichuan-style chilli sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
