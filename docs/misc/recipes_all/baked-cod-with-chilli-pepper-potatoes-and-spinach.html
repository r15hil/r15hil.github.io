<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut a piece of tin foil (or two!) approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper

Add the chopped pepper to the middle with the crushed garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium heat

Once hot, add your flaked almonds and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the toasted almonds to a food processor (reserve the pan) with the softened pepper and garlic (reserve the tray), your ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and white wine vinegar

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water and season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until you have a coarse paste – this is your chilli-pepper sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When the potatoes have 10 min left, line the reserved baking tray with tin foil

Add your cod fillet[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for 12 min or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<p>Once the cod is almost ready, return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat and add the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt

Return the pan to the heat and cook for 2-3 min or until wilted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Pour the chilli-pepper sauce over the cooked potatoes and give everything a good mix up – these are your chilli-pepper potatoes

Serve the baked cod with the chilli-pepper potatoes and spring greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
