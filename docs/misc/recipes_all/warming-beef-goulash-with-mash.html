<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the cornflour to a plate with a pinch of salt and pepper

Coat the beef strips in the cornflour

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated beef strips and cook for 2-3 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 30 min or until the sauce has thickened and everything's cooked through – this is your warming beef goulash</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the goulash is cooking, cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Tip: If you'd rather skin-off mash, peel the potatoes first

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt over a high heat and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the goulash is nearly done, return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warming beef goulash with the mash to the side

Garnish the goulash with the chopped parsley

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
