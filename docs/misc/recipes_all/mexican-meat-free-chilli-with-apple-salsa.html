<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the diced red onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt, then cook for 5 min or until softened and starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the remaining diced red onion to a bowl with a pinch of salt and your red wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red onion

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Stir your ground allspice into the softened onion and cook for 1 min

Add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and cook over a high heat for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite, then drain and return to the pot

While the bulgur wheat is cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 350ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the meat-free mince has browned, stir in your tomato paste and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1 min

Add the vegetable stock and reduce the heat to medium-low

Cook for 6-7 min or until thick and reduced to a chilli-like consistency – this is your Mexican-Style meat-free mince chilli</p><br><br>
