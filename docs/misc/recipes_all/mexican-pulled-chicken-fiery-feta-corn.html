<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add the sweetcorn cobettes to a large piece of tin foil and top with a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around the corn until tightly sealed and add to a baking tray, then put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the corn is tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the corn is in the oven, rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat 

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked 

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Combine the mayo with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime – this is your lime mayo

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Crumble the feta

Set everything aside for serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, ground coriander and half the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the chicken breast portions to the plate and turn them several times until fully coated in all the spices – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 3 min on each side

Add the tomato paste with 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> cold water, give everything a good mix up and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a board and shred it apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Return the pulled chicken to the pan with the sauce and stir it all together – this is your Mexican-style pulled chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir most of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) through the cooked rice – this is your coriander rice

Carefully remove the sweetcorn cobettes from the tin foil and cut them in half</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mexican-style pulled chicken over the coriander rice with the halved sweetcorn cobettes to the side

Top the cobettes with the crumbled feta, remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and remaining coriander – this is your fiery feta corn

Drizzle the lime mayo all over and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
