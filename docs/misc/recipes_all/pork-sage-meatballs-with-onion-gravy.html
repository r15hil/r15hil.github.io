<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 160°C/ 140°C (fan)/ gas 3

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until soft and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the onion is cooking, combine your pork mince (remove the paper from the mince if required!), panko breadcrumbs, dried sage and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl

Mix everything together until fully combined, then shape into 6 <span class="text-purple">[9] </span><span class="text-danger">[12]</span> meatballs (they don't have to look perfect!) – these are your pork & sage meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the onion is soft and caramelised, transfer it to a plate and return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add the pork & sage meatballs to the pan and cook for 4-5 min, turning frequently, until they're browned on all sides

Once browned, transfer to a plate and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your shredded kale then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the shredded kale to a baking tray with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and mix well

Put the tray in the oven for 10-15 min or until crisp - this is your crispy kale

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into rough, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [450 ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with knob of butter

Once melted, stir in 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min

Add the beef stock and onion marmalade and whisk until combined

Return the browned pork & sage meatballs and caramelised onion to the pan and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened into a gravy-like consistency and the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a pinch of salt and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork & sage meatballs and onion gravy with the mash and crispy kale to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
