<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions and most of the sliced garlic (save some for later!) and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden

Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid, then cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add half of the diced avocado (you'll use the rest later!), most of the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) and the reserved sliced garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a food processor

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your avo dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper and add to a large bowl with the tomato wedges, remaining diced avocado and croutons, season with a pinch of salt and a little drizzle of olive oil

Give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board and slice finely

Serve the sliced chicken over the salad and drizzle the avo dressing all over

Garnish with a grind of black pepper, the remaining basil and a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
