<p><strong>Description:</strong> Caponata, pronounced 'ka-pon-arter' is a sweet and sour aubergine stew originating in Sicily. Itâ€™s a bit like ratatouille but also contains capers and sultanas, typical features of Sicilian cooking. You'll serve it over quinoa, with some mozzarella snuggled in at the end of cooking, so that it starts to go all melty and delicious. Stew-pendous!</p>
