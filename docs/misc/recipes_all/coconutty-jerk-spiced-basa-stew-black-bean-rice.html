<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Chop your tomato[es] into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into thin wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion wedges and chopped tomato to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until slightly softened

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your basa fillet[s] into large, bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required)

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and tomato have softened slightly, add half the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with your tomato paste

Cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chopped creamed coconut to the pan with your vegetable stock mix, jerk paste and 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Add the chopped basa to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until cooked through – this is your coconutty jerk-spiced basa stew

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your cooked white long grain rice to the pan with the remaining chopped garlic and drained black beans

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of water, stir together and cook for 3-4 min or until warmed through – this is your black bean rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconutty jerk-spiced basa stew with the black bean rice to the side

Season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
