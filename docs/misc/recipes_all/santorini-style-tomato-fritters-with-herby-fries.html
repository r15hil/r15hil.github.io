Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crisp – these are your herby fries</p><br><br>

Add half the Santorini-style tomato salad (save the rest for later!) to the bowl with the remaining dried oregano, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), remaining ground paprika, chopped garlic, crumbled Greek cheese and a very generous pinch of salt and sugar

Carefully flip and cook for 4-5 min on the other side or until golden and cooked through – these are your Santorini-style tomato fritters</p><br><br>
