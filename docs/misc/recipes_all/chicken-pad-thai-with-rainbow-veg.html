<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the pad Thai sauce to the pan with the cooked Thai rice noodles and cook for 2 min further until all the noodles are coated

Push the noodles to one side of the pan and crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the other side

Stir the egg with a wooden spoon and cook for 1-2 min, then mix it all through the noodles – this is your chicken pad Thai with rainbow veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Bash the roasted peanuts with a rolling pin until roughly crushed (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

Serve the chicken pad Thai with rainbow veg in bowls and squeeze over the juice from the remaining lime

Tear over the coriander leaves and top with the crushed peanuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
