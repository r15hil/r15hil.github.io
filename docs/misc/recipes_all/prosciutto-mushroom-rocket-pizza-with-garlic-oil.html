<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop your pizza bottom[s] from going soggy!)

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Slice your button mushrooms finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Divide the tomato base between your pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all over them with the back of a spoon

Top with the sliced mushrooms and torn mozzarella

Tip: Cooking for 2 or more? Make sure the pizzas don't overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!</p><br><br>

<p>While the pizza[s] are cooking, add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil to a pot over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove from the heat and set aside to infuse until serving – this is your garlic oil
