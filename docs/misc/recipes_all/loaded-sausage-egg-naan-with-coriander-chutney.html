<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the sausages and potatoes are in the oven, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add most of the chopped coriander (save a little for later!), the chopped garlic and the chopped ginger (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a small bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up

Add the white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil, a pinch of sugar and mix to combine – this is your coriander chutney</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>and combine it with the remaining chopped coriander – this is your shallot salad

Combine the mayo and mint sauce with a splash of cold water in a small bowl– this is your mint mayo

When your sausages are almost ready, add the naans to a separate baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until the bread is hot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a medium, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack the eggs into the pan

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Mix the roasted tomatoes and potatoes together on the tray and slice the cooked sausages in half lengthways on a clean chopping board

Top the warmed naan with the halved sausages and a fried egg, then dollop over the mint mayo and shallot salad

Serve the roasted tomatoes & potatoes to the side and drizzle the coriander chutney all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
