<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until beginning to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, drain your king prawns then add them to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until cooked through

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine your soured cream, chopped shallot and chopped dill in a small bowl

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together – this is your dill sauce

Once the prawns have cooled, stir the cooked prawns through the dill sauce – this is your Scandinavian-style king prawn skagen</p><br><br>

Serve the crispy potatoes and zingy apple salad to the side
