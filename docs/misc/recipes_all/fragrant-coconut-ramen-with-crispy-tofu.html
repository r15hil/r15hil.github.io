<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Drain your tofu and cut lengthways into 3 slices per person, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Add the sliced tofu to a bowl with half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated tofu

Add your panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt to a plate, pressing the marinated tofu into the panko breadcrumbs firmly, until evenly coated all over – this is your coated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated tofu and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until golden and crispy all over, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and reserve the pan – this is your crispy tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 700ml <span class="text-purple">[1L]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1.3L] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the noodles are beginning to soften, add the pak choi quarters and cook for 4-5 min further

After 4-5 min, add the spinach to the pan and cook for 1 min or until the noodles are cooked with a slight bite, the pak choi is tender and the spinach has wilted – this is your fragrant coconut ramen</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fragrant coconut ramen in a bowl and top with the crispy tofu

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
