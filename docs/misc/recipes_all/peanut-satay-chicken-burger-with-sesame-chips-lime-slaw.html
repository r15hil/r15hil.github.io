<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with your toasted sesame seeds, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your sesame chips</p><br><br>

<p>Cover your chicken breast portion[s] in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flattened to approx. 1cm thickness</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add your brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and charred

Set aside until serving, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your peanut butter and soy sauce in a bowl with your red chilli relish and the juice of the remaining lime

Add 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> warm water and stir it all together – this is your satay sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the cooked chicken to the bowl with the satay sauce and toss until the chicken is fully coated – this is your peanut satay chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, add a spoonful of lime slaw to the toasted brioche base, then top with the peanut satay chicken, spooning over any remaining satay sauce and the toasted brioche lid – this is your peanut satay chicken burger

Serve the peanut satay chicken burger with the sesame chips and remaining lime slaw to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
