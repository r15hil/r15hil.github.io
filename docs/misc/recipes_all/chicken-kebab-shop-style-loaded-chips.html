<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until the chips are lightly golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, add your white wine vinegar, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar, 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>warm water and a pinch of salt to a small bowl and stir together

Peel and slice your shallot[s] as thinly as you can, then add them to the bowl and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your curry powder to a medium bowl with your ginger & garlic paste and a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Add a generous pinch of salt and stir it all together – this is your marinade

Add the chicken breast strips to the marinade, give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your marinated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until charred and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your kebab shop-style chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, combine your mayo, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and 2 tsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp] </span>[4 tsp]</span> cold water – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chips are lightly golden, divide them into a pile for per person on the baking tray[s]

Divide the grated cheese between each pile

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 3-4 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – these are your cheesy chips</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the kebab shop-style chicken over the cheesy chips

Top with the shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and quick-pickled shallot

Garnish with a drizzle of garlic mayo and ketchup

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
