Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your ginger rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Season the salmon with a pinch of salt and spoon the sweet chilli sauce over the top evenly
