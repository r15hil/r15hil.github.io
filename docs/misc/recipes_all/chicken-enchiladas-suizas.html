<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 4, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Slice half your green chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the remaining

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skins</p><br><br>

Drain your sweetcorn</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, tomato paste, chicken stock mix and drained sweetcorn with 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> boiled water

Cook for 2-3 min further, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has slightly thickened – this is your chicken & sweetcorn filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander roughly

Add the chopped coriander, crushed garlic and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and bash into a smooth paste

Stir the coriander paste through your soured cream – this is your enchiladas suizas sauce

Tip: If you don't have a pestle & mortar, chop the coriander very finely and mix with the salt and sour cream in a bowl!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Divide the chicken & sweetcorn filling between your tortillas

Roll each tortilla up and arrange them in an oven-proof dish

Top with the enchiladas suizas sauce and grated cheese

Put the dish in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your chicken thigh enchiladas suizas</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken thigh enchiladas suizas

Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
