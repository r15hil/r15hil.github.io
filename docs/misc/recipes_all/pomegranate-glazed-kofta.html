<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Gousto twist: Here we have given the classic kofta a bit of a re-vamp. Scorching hot from under the grill, you'll coat these little lamb meatballs in pomegranate molasses. Sticky and sour, they are then rolled in toasted pine nuts for a delicious crumb crust.</p>
