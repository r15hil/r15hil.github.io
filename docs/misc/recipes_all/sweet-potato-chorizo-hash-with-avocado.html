<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your kale, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so it starts to wilt

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the kale as you can</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the cooked sweet potato (careful not to tip any of the water into the pan) and a pinch of salt

Crush the potatoes lightly and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown

Tip: Stir as little as possible to give the potatoes a chance to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are starting to brown, add your diced chorizo to the pan with the sliced red onion and a pinch of salt

Cook for a further 6-7 min, stirring occasionally, until the chorizo is cooked through and everything is beginning to crisp

Tip: Reduce the heat to low if the potatoes start to burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
