<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Boil a kettle

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 15-20 min or until fork-tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the aubergine<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into quarters lengthways

Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care to not cut the skin

Add the scored aubergine quarters to a baking tray, cut-side up

Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle over the smoked paprika and season with a generous pinch of salt, then put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until softened – this is your paprika aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the aubergine is cooking, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Grate the cucumber<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Squeeze any excess water out of the grated cucumber

Combine the grated cucumber, chopped mint and half the cultured coconut (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl with a small pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coconut raita</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Dice the tomatoes

Chop most of the coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Add the diced tomatoes and chopped coriander to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside – this is your tomato salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the brown onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the drained potatoes and sliced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until the onion has softened and the potatoes are starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Drain and rinse the chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are starting to brown, add the sliced garlic, chopped ginger, ground turmeric, curry powder and drained chickpeas to the pan with a pinch of salt and cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the remaining cultured coconut – these are your curried potatoes</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the paprika aubergine on top of the curried potatoes with the coconut raita and tomato salsa to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
