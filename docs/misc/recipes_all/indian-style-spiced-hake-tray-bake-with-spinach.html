<h4>Step 1</h4>

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Add the chopped ginger to a large bowl with your curry powder, half your natural yoghurt (save the rest for later!) and a drizzle of vegetable oil

Add your hake fillet[s] and give everything a good mix up until the hake is fully coated in the marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your lemon[s] into wedges

Squeeze half the lemon wedges over the potatoes and add the squeezed wedges to the tray[s] (save the remaining wedges for garnish)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once everything's been cooking for 20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and sprinkle the spinach all over, then place the marinated hake fillet[s] on top

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 12-15 min or until the spinach has wilted and the hake is cooked through – this is your Indian-style spiced hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your red chilli[es] finely

Once everything's cooked, remove the Indian-style spiced hake from the tray[s] and stir the wilted spinach through the potatoes and onion wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Indian-style spiced hake with the potato, spinach and onion wedges to the side

Dollop with the remaining natural yoghurt

Garnish with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), nigella seeds and lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
