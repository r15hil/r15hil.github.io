<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, chop your parsley & chives finely, including the stalks and grate your Italian hard cheese

Crumble your feta into rough bite-sized pieces, then chop your black olives finely

Combine the chopped olives in a bowl with half of your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a good grind of black pepper – this is your olive tapenade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the base of your lettuce

Wash the lettuce under cold running water and cut away the core, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Tear the lettuce leaves from the stem until you are left with a pile of leaves and add to a large bowl with the remaining red wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil and give it a gentle mix – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked through, add half of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!), chopped parsley & chives and crumbled feta to the risotto

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your herby feta risotto

Tip: Add a splash of water if the risotto is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Drizzle the olive tapenade over the herby feta risotto and top with a roasted whole tomato

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese

Serve the dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
