<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Once cooked, squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon – these are your lemony king prawns</p><br><br>

Season with a pinch of salt and a little olive oil and give it a gentle mix up – this is your salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the lemony king prawns over the salad and drizzle the avo dressing all over

Garnish with a grind of black pepper and the remaining basil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
