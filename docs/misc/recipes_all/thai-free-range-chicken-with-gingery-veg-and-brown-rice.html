<h4>Step 1</h4>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite, then drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped shallot, garlic, chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and coriander stalks to a pestle & mortar

Tip: Don't have a pestle & mortar? Use a food processor!

Add a pinch of salt and grind to a paste – this is your Thai-style paste

Dissolve your creamed coconut in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[200ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water and add your soy sauce – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>
