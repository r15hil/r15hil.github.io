Cut the potatoes (skins on) into large bite-sized pieces

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are fork-tender, run the drained potatoes under cold running water until they're cool enough to handle

Return them to the pot, add a generous knob of butter and crush gently

Add the crushed potatoes to the salmon mixture and give everything a good mix up – this is your kofta mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Divide the kofta mixture into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12]</span>, then shape them into round balls – these are your salmon koftas

Add the salmon koftas to a tin foil-lined baking tray

Drizzle with olive oil and put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until the koftas are golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the koftas are cooking, slice the cucumber finely

Combine the sliced cucumber and the shredded red cabbage in a bowl with half the natural yoghurt, half the ground sumac (save the rest for later!), the white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your sumac yoghurt slaw</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the salmon koftas with the brown rice and sumac yoghurt slaw to the side

Drizzle over the remaining natural yoghurt and garnish with the remaining ground sumac

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
