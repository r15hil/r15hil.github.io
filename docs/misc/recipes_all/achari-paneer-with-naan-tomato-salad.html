<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Chop your paneer into large, bite-sized cubes

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the paneer cubes and cook for 3-4 min or until golden all over, then set aside on a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>
