<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [400ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time for fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, combine your cornflour with your soy sauce and honey in a bowl – this is your soy sauce glaze

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Chop off and discard the roots from your pak choi, separate the leaves and give them a wash, then pat dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through to the skin

Transfer the scored aubergine to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) then drizzle with vegetable oil and half of the soy sauce glaze (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the aubergine is tender – this is your soy-glazed aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!), tahini, mayo and rice vinegar in a large bowl

Season with salt and pepper – this is your Japanese-style dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s]

Slice your apple[s] finely, then chop into matchsticks (discard the core!)

Slice your sugar snap peas in half lengthways

Add the grated carrot, apple matchsticks and halved sugar snap peas to the Japanese-style dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your Japanese-style slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to wilt

Once the pak choi has wilted, add the remaining soy sauce glaze to the pan along with a splash of water and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the soy-glazed aubergine over the pak choi with the sticky rice and Japanese-style slaw to the side

Garnish the aubergine with the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
