<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

Deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has begun to soften, add the sliced garlic with the smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander, dried oregano and cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your fajita spice base

Give everything a good mix up and cook for 1 min or until the garlic has slightly softened

Add the halved cherry tomatoes and sliced pepper with a small splash of boiled water and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes begin to blister</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse the black beans

Add half the black beans with a small pinch of salt to a baking paper-lined baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 6-7 min or until the beans pop – these are your popped beans

Add the remaining black beans to the pan with the vegetable stock mix and 100ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> boiled water, mix everything together and cook for 2 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar cheese

Make 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> wells in the pan and crack the eggs into them, then cook covered for 2-3 min or until the eggs are done to your liking – this is your fajita-spiced shakshuka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the eggs are cooking, cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely lengthways</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fajita-spiced shakshuka with the sliced avocado to the side

Top with the grated cheese and sprinkle over the popped beans

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
