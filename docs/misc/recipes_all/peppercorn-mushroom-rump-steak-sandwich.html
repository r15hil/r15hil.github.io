<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thick chips and add to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are in the oven, slice your chestnut mushrooms finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 4-5 min or until golden

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are browning, chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Add the chopped tomatoes to a bowl with half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a pinch of salt and set aside until later – these are your balsamic tomatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have browned, add your cracked black pepper and cook for 30 secs, then add your Chinese rice wine and cook until evaporated

Add your soft cheese with your soy sauce and 80ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[120ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat, then turn the heat to low and cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened, then remove from the heat and set aside – these are your peppercorn mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then rub with vegetable oil and season both sides generously with salt and pepper

Combine the remaining balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of olive oil  – this is your dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once very hot, add the seasoned rump steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a clean board to rest and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a knob of butter

One melted, add the ciabatta halves, cut side down and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and charred, then set aside until serving

Slice the rested rump steak finely on a clean chopping board

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your sandwich, top the toasted ciabatta base with the peppercorn mushrooms, half the balsamic tomatoes, the sliced rump steak, half the salad and a ciabatta lid – this is your peppercorn mushroom & rump steak sandwich

Serve the chips with the remaining balsamic tomatoes and salad to the side and drizzle the dressing over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
