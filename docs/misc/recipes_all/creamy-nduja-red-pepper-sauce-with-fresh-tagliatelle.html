<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the pepper strips to the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fresh tagliatelle to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the tagliatelle, reserving 175ml <span class="text-purple">[230ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml] </span>starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add the sliced garlic and your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for a further 3-4 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained tagliatelle to the pan and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce – this is your creamy 'Nduja & red pepper sauce with fresh tagliatelle</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy 'Nduja & red pepper sauce with fresh tagliatelle with the shredded lettuce to the side

Drizzle the lettuce with a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
