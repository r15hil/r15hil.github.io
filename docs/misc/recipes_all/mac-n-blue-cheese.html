<li>200g conchiglie</li>
<li>30g walnuts</li>
<li>50g stilton cheese</li>
<li>1 broccoli </li>

</ul><br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C/ 200&deg;C (fan)/ 425&deg;F/ Gas 7


Peel and finely dice the onion<span class="text-danger">(s)</span>


Heat a wide based pan with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">(2 tbsp)</span> of olive oil


When hot, add the pancetta and onion


Cook on a medium heat for 10 min or until the pancetta is crispy and the onion soft</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle (used in step 3)


Cut the broccoli into florets 


Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper


Put it in the oven for 15-20 min or until the broccoli is crispy on the outside</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the pasta to a large pot of boiling water with a large pinch of salt


Cook for&nbsp;8 min, or until&nbsp;al-dente


Once cooked, drain and allow to steam dry in the colander</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, break up the stilton into small pieces


Bash up the walnuts (whilst still in the bag) with a rolling pin or other suitable implement until you have fine crumbs


Tip: Alternatively, use a food processor or pestle and mortar to break up the walnuts</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the pancetta and onion are cooked,&nbsp;set aside in a bowl for step 7


Return the&nbsp;pan to a medium heat and add 30g <span class="text-danger">(60g)</span> of butter


Once the butter is melted, gradually stir in 30g <span class="text-danger">(60g)</span> of flour and cook for 2 min, stirring constantly


You should end up with a sandy textured, honey coloured paste - this is your roux</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whisk in 400ml <span class="text-danger">(800ml)</span> of milk gradually to the roux


Cook for 5 min, stirring continuously, until a smooth fairly loose sauce forms, then remove it from the heat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the stilton and pancetta-onion mix to the sauce


Stir in the pasta


Season to your taste with salt and pepper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Transfer the pasta mix to your oven-proof dish<span class="text-danger">(es)</span> and sprinkle with the bashed walnuts


Cook in the oven for 5-10 min, or until the walnuts are coloured 


Serve with the broccoli to the side


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
