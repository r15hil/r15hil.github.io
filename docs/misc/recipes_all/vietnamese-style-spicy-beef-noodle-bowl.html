<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once softened, increase to the highest heat and add the marinated beef strips

Cook for 1-2 min until just seared

Once seared, transfer the chilli beef strips to a plate to rest

Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the rice noodles in bowls and add the chilli beef strips with the grated carrot, pickled cucumber, chopped herbs and crispy onions to the side

Drizzle the fresh ginger & lime dressing all over and sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
