<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot (with a matching lid) with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash then cut your pak choi in half, separating the white base and green tops, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Peel and slice the remaining garlic<span class="text-danger"> </span>finely

Add your mayo and rice vinegar to a bowl and combine – this is your Japanese-style mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi white base, toasted sesame seeds and sliced garlic with a small pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the pak choi has started to soften, then add the pak choi green tops and cook for a further 1 min or until wilted

Transfer the cooked pak choi to a plate and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cornflour to a bowl

Add the marinated hake pieces, leaving most of the marinade behind

Give everything a good mix up so the hake pieces are fully coated in cornflour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan

Once hot, add the coated hake pieces (cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!) and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until browned – this is your hake karaage

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hake karaage along side the brown rice and pak choi with the Japanese-style mayo as a dipping sauce on the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
