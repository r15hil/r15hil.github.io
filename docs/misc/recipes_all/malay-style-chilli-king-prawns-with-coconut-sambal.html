<h4>Step 1</h4>

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and slice lengthways finely – this is your julienne chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and half the julienne chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min or until soft</p><br><br>

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water with your creamed coconut and cornflour – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Malaysian-style kari udang prawn curry over the cooked rice and garnish with the remaining julienne chilli

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
