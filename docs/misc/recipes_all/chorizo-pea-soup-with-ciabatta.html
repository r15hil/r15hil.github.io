<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half

When the soup base is nearly ready, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped – this is your crispy chorizo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the potato is fork tender, stir your blanched peas through the soup base with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth with a (stick) blender – this is your pea soup

Place the ciabatta halves in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pea soup topped with the crispy chorizo and drizzle over any chorizo oil from the pan – this is your chorizo & pea soup

Serve the toasted ciabatta to the side

Tip: For extra indulgence, spread the ciabatta with a little butter before dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
