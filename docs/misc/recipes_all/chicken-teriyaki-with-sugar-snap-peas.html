<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml] </span>cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast strips with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until browned all over and cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
