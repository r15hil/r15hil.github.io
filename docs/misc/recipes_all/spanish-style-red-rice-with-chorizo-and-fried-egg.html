<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once softened, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and tomato paste and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice is nearly cooked, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the remaining diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped

Reduce the heat to medium-low, crack your egg[s] into the same pan and cook, covered, for 2-3 min or until done to your liking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add the drained sweetcorn, chopped coriander, the juice of half your lime[s] and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your Spanish-style red rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the Spanish-style red rice with the chorizo and fried egg on top and garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
