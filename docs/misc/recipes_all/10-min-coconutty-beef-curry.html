<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice into bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the diced pepper to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your beef stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water

Add your star anise and a pinch of sugar – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, add your curry powder, garam masala, turmeric and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the coconut stock and cook for 1-2 min further until thickened slightly – this is your coconutty beef curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconutty beef curry over the cooked rice

Tear over your coriander leaves

Tip: Watch out for the star anise and discard them!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
